ALBANY:
ACT I
ALBANY:
SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.
ALBANY:
Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN
FERDINAND:
Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
FERDINAND:
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
FERDINAND:
And then grace us in the disgrace of death,
FERDINAND:
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
FERDINAND:
The endeavor of this present breath may buy
FERDINAND:
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
FERDINAND:
And make us heirs of all eternity.
FERDINAND:
Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
FERDINAND:
That war against your own affections
FERDINAND:
And the huge army of the world's desires,--
FERDINAND:
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force
FERDINAND:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world,
FERDINAND:
Our court shall be a little Academe,
FERDINAND:
Still and contemplative in living art.
FERDINAND:
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
FERDINAND:
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
FERDINAND:
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
FERDINAND:
That are recorded in this schedule here
FERDINAND:
Your oaths are pass'd, and now subscribe your names,
FERDINAND:
That his own hand may strike his honour down
FERDINAND:
That violates the smallest branch herein
FERDINAND:
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
FERDINAND:
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
LONGAVILLE:
I am resolved, 'tis but a three years' fast
LONGAVILLE:
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine
LONGAVILLE:
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
LONGAVILLE:
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
DUMAIN:
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified
DUMAIN:
The grosser manner of these world's delights
DUMAIN:
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves
DUMAIN:
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,
DUMAIN:
With all these living in philosophy.
BIRON:
I can but say their protestation over,
BIRON:
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
BIRON:
That is, to live and study here three years.
BIRON:
But there are other strict observances,
BIRON:
As, not to see a woman in that term,
BIRON:
Which I hope well is not enrolled there,
BIRON:
And one day in a week to touch no food
BIRON:
And but one meal on every day beside,
BIRON:
The which I hope is not enrolled there,
BIRON:
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
BIRON:
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
BIRON:
When I was wont to think no harm all night
BIRON:
And make a dark night too of half the day--
BIRON:
Which I hope well is not enrolled there
BIRON:
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
BIRON:
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
FERDINAND:
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
BIRON:
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please
BIRON:
I only swore to study with your grace
BIRON:
And stay here in your court for three years' space.
LONGAVILLE:
You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
BIRON:
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
BIRON:
What is the end of study? let me know.
FERDINAND:
Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
BIRON:
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
FERDINAND:
Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
BIRON:
Come on, then, I will swear to study so,
BIRON:
To know the thing I am forbid to know
BIRON:
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
BIRON:
When I to feast expressly am forbid,
BIRON:
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
BIRON:
When mistresses from common sense are hid,
BIRON:
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
BIRON:
Study to break it and not break my troth.
BIRON:
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
BIRON:
Study knows that which yet it doth not know
BIRON:
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
FERDINAND:
These be the stops that hinder study quite
FERDINAND:
And train our intellects to vain delight.
BIRON:
Why, all delights are vain, but that most vain,
BIRON:
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain
BIRON:
As, painfully to pore upon a book
BIRON:
To seek the light of truth, while truth the while
BIRON:
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
BIRON:
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile
BIRON:
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
BIRON:
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
BIRON:
Study me how to please the eye indeed
BIRON:
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
BIRON:
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
BIRON:
And give him light that it was blinded by.
BIRON:
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
BIRON:
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks
BIRON:
Small have continual plodders ever won
BIRON:
Save base authority from others' books
BIRON:
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
BIRON:
That give a name to every fixed star
BIRON:
Have no more profit of their shining nights
BIRON:
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
BIRON:
Too much to know is to know nought but fame,
BIRON:
And every godfather can give a name.
FERDINAND:
How well he's read, to reason against reading!
DUMAIN:
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
LONGAVILLE:
He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
BIRON:
The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
DUMAIN:
How follows that?
BIRON:
Fit in his place and time.
DUMAIN:
In reason nothing.
BIRON:
Something then in rhyme.
FERDINAND:
Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
FERDINAND:
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
BIRON:
Well, say I am, why should proud summer boast
BIRON:
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
BIRON:
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
BIRON:
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
BIRON:
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth,
BIRON:
But like of each thing that in season grows.
BIRON:
So you, to study now it is too late,
BIRON:
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
FERDINAND:
Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
BIRON:
No, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you
BIRON:
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
BIRON:
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
BIRON:
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
BIRON:
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
BIRON:
Give me the paper, let me read the same,
BIRON:
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
FERDINAND:
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
BIRON:
[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within a
BIRON:
mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
LONGAVILLE:
Four days ago.
BIRON:
Let's see the penalty.
BIRON:
Reads
BIRON:
'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
LONGAVILLE:
Marry, that did I.
BIRON:
Sweet lord, and why?
LONGAVILLE:
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
BIRON:
A dangerous law against gentility!
BIRON:
Reads
BIRON:
'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
BIRON:
within the term of three years, he shall endure such
BIRON:
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
BIRON:
This article, my liege, yourself must break,
BIRON:
For well you know here comes in embassy
BIRON:
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
BIRON:
A maid of grace and complete majesty--
BIRON:
About surrender up of Aquitaine
BIRON:
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father
BIRON:
Therefore this article is made in vain,
BIRON:
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
FERDINAND:
What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
BIRON:
So study evermore is overshot
BIRON:
While it doth study to have what it would
BIRON:
It doth forget to do the thing it should,
BIRON:
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
BIRON:
'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.
FERDINAND:
We must of force dispense with this decree,
FERDINAND:
She must lie here on mere necessity.
BIRON:
Necessity will make us all forsworn
BIRON:
Three thousand times within this three years' space,
BIRON:
For every man with his affects is born,
BIRON:
Not by might master'd but by special grace
BIRON:
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me,
BIRON:
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
BIRON:
So to the laws at large I write my name
BIRON:
Subscribes
BIRON:
And he that breaks them in the least degree
BIRON:
Stands in attainder of eternal shame
BIRON:
Suggestions are to other as to me,
BIRON:
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
BIRON:
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
BIRON:
But is there no quick recreation granted?
FERDINAND:
Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
FERDINAND:
With a refined traveller of Spain,
FERDINAND:
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
FERDINAND:
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain,
FERDINAND:
One whom the music of his own vain tongue
FERDINAND:
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony,
FERDINAND:
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
FERDINAND:
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny
FERDINAND:
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
FERDINAND:
For interim to our studies shall relate
FERDINAND:
In high-born words the worth of many a knight
FERDINAND:
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
FERDINAND:
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I,
FERDINAND:
But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
FERDINAND:
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
BIRON:
Armado is a most illustrious wight,
BIRON:
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
LONGAVILLE:
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport,
LONGAVILLE:
And so to study, three years is but short.
LONGAVILLE:
Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD
DULL:
Which is the duke's own person?
BIRON:
This, fellow: what wouldst?
DULL:
I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
DULL:
grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
DULL:
in flesh and blood.
BIRON:
This is he.
DULL:
Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
DULL:
abroad: this letter will tell you more.
COSTARD:
Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
FERDINAND:
A letter from the magnificent Armado.
BIRON:
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
LONGAVILLE:
A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
BIRON:
To hear? or forbear laughing?
LONGAVILLE:
To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately, or to
LONGAVILLE:
forbear both.
BIRON:
Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
BIRON:
climb in the merriness.
COSTARD:
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
COSTARD:
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
BIRON:
In what manner?
COSTARD:
In manner and form following, sir, all those three
COSTARD:
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
COSTARD:
her upon the form, and taken following her into the
COSTARD:
park, which, put together, is in manner and form
COSTARD:
following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
COSTARD:
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
COSTARD:
in some form.
BIRON:
For the following, sir?
COSTARD:
As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
COSTARD:
the right!
FERDINAND:
Will you hear this letter with attention?
BIRON:
As we would hear an oracle.
COSTARD:
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
FERDINAND:
[Reads]  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
FERDINAND:
sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
FERDINAND:
and body's fostering patron.'
COSTARD:
Not a word of Costard yet.
FERDINAND:
[Reads]  'So it is,'--
COSTARD:
It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
COSTARD:
telling true, but so.
FERDINAND:
Peace!
COSTARD:
Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
FERDINAND:
No words!
COSTARD:
Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
FERDINAND:
[Reads]  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
FERDINAND:
melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
FERDINAND:
to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
FERDINAND:
air, and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
FERDINAND:
walk. The time when. About the sixth hour, when
FERDINAND:
beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
FERDINAND:
to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
FERDINAND:
for the time when. Now for the ground which, which,
FERDINAND:
I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
FERDINAND:
for the place where, where, I mean, I did encounter
FERDINAND:
that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
FERDINAND:
from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
FERDINAND:
here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest,
FERDINAND:
but to the place where, it standeth north-north-east
FERDINAND:
and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
FERDINAND:
knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
FERDINAND:
swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--
COSTARD:
Me?
FERDINAND:
[Reads]  'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--
COSTARD:
Me?
FERDINAND:
[Reads]  'that shallow vassal,'--
COSTARD:
Still me?
FERDINAND:
[Reads]  'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
COSTARD:
O, me!
FERDINAND:
[Reads]  'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
FERDINAND:
established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
FERDINAND:
which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
FERDINAND:
wherewith,--
COSTARD:
With a wench.
FERDINAND:
[Reads]  'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
FERDINAND:
female, or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
FERDINAND:
woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
FERDINAND:
have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
FERDINAND:
punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
FERDINAND:
Dull, a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
FERDINAND:
estimation.'
DULL:
'Me, an't shall please you, I am Anthony Dull.
FERDINAND:
[Reads]  'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
FERDINAND:
called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
FERDINAND:
swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury,
FERDINAND:
and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
FERDINAND:
her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
FERDINAND:
and heart-burning heat of duty.
FERDINAND:
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
BIRON:
This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
BIRON:
that ever I heard.
FERDINAND:
Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
FERDINAND:
you to this?
COSTARD:
Sir, I confess the wench.
FERDINAND:
Did you hear the proclamation?
COSTARD:
I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
COSTARD:
the marking of it.
FERDINAND:
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
FERDINAND:
with a wench.
COSTARD:
I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
FERDINAND:
Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'
COSTARD:
This was no damsel, neither, sir, she was a virgin.
FERDINAND:
It is so varied, too, for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
COSTARD:
If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
FERDINAND:
This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
COSTARD:
This maid will serve my turn, sir.
FERDINAND:
Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
FERDINAND:
a week with bran and water.
COSTARD:
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
FERDINAND:
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
FERDINAND:
My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er
FERDINAND:
And go we, lords, to put in practise that
FERDINAND:
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
FERDINAND:
Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN
BIRON:
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
BIRON:
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
BIRON:
Sirrah, come on.
COSTARD:
I suffer for the truth, sir, for true it is, I was
COSTARD:
taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
COSTARD:
girl, and therefore welcome the sour cup of
COSTARD:
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again, and
COSTARD:
till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
COSTARD:
Exeunt
COSTARD:
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
COSTARD:
SCENE II. The same.
COSTARD:
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
grows melancholy?
MOTH:
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
MOTH:
No, no, O Lord, sir, no.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
tender juvenal?
MOTH:
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Why tough senior? why tough senior?
MOTH:
Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
appertaining to thy young days, which we may
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
nominate tender.
MOTH:
And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
MOTH:
old time, which we may name tough.
MOTH:
DON ADRIANO DE
ARMADO:
Pretty and apt.
MOTH:
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
MOTH:
I apt, and my saying pretty?
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Thou pretty, because little.
MOTH:
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And therefore apt, because quick.
MOTH:
Speak you this in my praise, master?
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
In thy condign praise.
MOTH:
I will praise an eel with the same praise.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
What, that an eel is ingenious?
MOTH:
That an eel is quick.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
MOTH:
I am answered, sir.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I love not to be crossed.
MOTH:
[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary, crosses love not him.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I have promised to study three years with the duke.
MOTH:
You may do it in an hour, sir.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Impossible.
MOTH:
How many is one thrice told?
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I am ill at reckoning, it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
MOTH:
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
complete man.
MOTH:
Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
MOTH:
deuce-ace amounts to.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
It doth amount to one more than two.
MOTH:
Which the base vulgar do call three.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
True.
MOTH:
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
MOTH:
is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
MOTH:
easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
MOTH:
study three years in two words, the dancing horse
MOTH:
will tell you.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
A most fine figure!
MOTH:
To prove you a cipher.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
have been in love?
MOTH:
Hercules, master.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
more, and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
repute and carriage.
MOTH:
Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
MOTH:
carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
MOTH:
like a porter: and he was in love.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
love, my dear Moth?
MOTH:
A woman, master.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Of what complexion?
MOTH:
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Tell me precisely of what complexion.
MOTH:
Of the sea-water green, sir.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Is that one of the four complexions?
MOTH:
As I have read, sir, and the best of them too.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Green indeed is the colour of lovers, but to have a
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
MOTH:
It was so, sir, for she had a green wit.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
My love is most immaculate white and red.
MOTH:
Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
MOTH:
such colours.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Define, define, well-educated infant.
MOTH:
My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet invocation of a child, most pretty and
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
pathetical!
MOTH:
If she be made of white and red,
MOTH:
Her faults will ne'er be known,
MOTH:
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
MOTH:
And fears by pale white shown
MOTH:
Then if she fear, or be to blame,
MOTH:
By this you shall not know,
MOTH:
For still her cheeks possess the same
MOTH:
Which native she doth owe.
MOTH:
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
MOTH:
white and red.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
MOTH:
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
MOTH:
three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
MOTH:
found, or, if it were, it would neither serve for
MOTH:
the writing nor the tune.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
example my digression by some mighty precedent.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
MOTH:
[Aside]  To be whipped, and yet a better love than
MOTH:
my master.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sing, boy, my spirit grows heavy in love.
MOTH:
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I say, sing.
MOTH:
Forbear till this company be past.
MOTH:
Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA
DULL:
Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
DULL:
safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
DULL:
nor no penance, but a' must fast three days a week.
DULL:
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
DULL:
is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
DULL:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
JAQUENETTA:
Man?
JAQUENETTA:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will visit thee at the lodge.
JAQUENETTA:
That's hereby.
JAQUENETTA:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I know where it is situate.
JAQUENETTA:
Lord, how wise you are!
JAQUENETTA:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will tell thee wonders.
JAQUENETTA:
With that face?
JAQUENETTA:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I love thee.
JAQUENETTA:
So I heard you say.
JAQUENETTA:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And so, farewell.
JAQUENETTA:
Fair weather after you!
DULL:
Come, Jaquenetta, away!
DULL:
Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA
DULL:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
be pardoned.
COSTARD:
Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
COSTARD:
full stomach.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Thou shalt be heavily punished.
COSTARD:
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
COSTARD:
are but lightly rewarded.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Take away this villain, shut him up.
MOTH:
Come, you transgressing slave, away!
COSTARD:
Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
MOTH:
No, sir, that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
COSTARD:
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
COSTARD:
that I have seen, some shall see.
MOTH:
What shall some see?
COSTARD:
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
COSTARD:
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
COSTARD:
words, and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
COSTARD:
God I have as little patience as another man, and
COSTARD:
therefore I can be quiet.
COSTARD:
Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
how can that be true love which is falsely
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
attempted? Love is a familiar, Love is a devil
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
tempted, and he had an excellent strength, yet was
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The first and second cause will not serve my turn,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
not: his disgrace is to be called boy, but his
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
be still, drum! for your manager is in love, yea,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
write, pen, for I am for whole volumes in folio.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Exit

LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
ACT II
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
SCENE I. The same.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants
BOYET:
Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits
BOYET:
Consider who the king your father sends,
BOYET:
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy
BOYET:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
BOYET:
To parley with the sole inheritor
BOYET:
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
BOYET:
Matchless Navarre, the plea of no less weight
BOYET:
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
BOYET:
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
BOYET:
As Nature was in making graces dear
BOYET:
When she did starve the general world beside
BOYET:
And prodigally gave them all to you.
PRINCESS:
Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
PRINCESS:
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise
PRINCESS:
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
PRINCESS:
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues
PRINCESS:
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
PRINCESS:
Than you much willing to be counted wise
PRINCESS:
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
PRINCESS:
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
PRINCESS:
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
PRINCESS:
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
PRINCESS:
Till painful study shall outwear three years,
PRINCESS:
No woman may approach his silent court
PRINCESS:
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
PRINCESS:
Before we enter his forbidden gates,
PRINCESS:
To know his pleasure, and in that behalf,
PRINCESS:
Bold of your worthiness, we single you
PRINCESS:
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
PRINCESS:
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
PRINCESS:
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
PRINCESS:
Importunes personal conference with his grace
PRINCESS:
Haste, signify so much, while we attend,
PRINCESS:
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
BOYET:
Proud of employment, willingly I go.
PRINCESS:
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
PRINCESS:
Exit BOYET
PRINCESS:
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
PRINCESS:
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?
First Lord:
Lord Longaville is one.
PRINCESS:
Know you the man?
MARIA:
I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
MARIA:
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
MARIA:
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
MARIA:
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville
MARIA:
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd,
MARIA:
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms
MARIA:
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
MARIA:
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
MARIA:
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
MARIA:
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will,
MARIA:
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
MARIA:
It should none spare that come within his power.
PRINCESS:
Some merry mocking lord, belike, is't so?
MARIA:
They say so most that most his humours know.
PRINCESS:
Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
PRINCESS:
Who are the rest?
KATHARINE:
The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
KATHARINE:
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved
KATHARINE:
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,
KATHARINE:
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
KATHARINE:
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
KATHARINE:
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once,
KATHARINE:
And much too little of that good I saw
KATHARINE:
Is my report to his great worthiness.
ROSALINE:
Another of these students at that time
ROSALINE:
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
ROSALINE:
Biron they call him, but a merrier man,
ROSALINE:
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
ROSALINE:
I never spent an hour's talk withal
ROSALINE:
His eye begets occasion for his wit,
ROSALINE:
For every object that the one doth catch
ROSALINE:
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
ROSALINE:
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
ROSALINE:
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
ROSALINE:
That aged ears play truant at his tales
ROSALINE:
And younger hearings are quite ravished,
ROSALINE:
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
PRINCESS:
God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
PRINCESS:
That every one her own hath garnished
PRINCESS:
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
First Lord:
Here comes Boyet.
First Lord:
Re-enter BOYET
PRINCESS:
Now, what admittance, lord?
BOYET:
Navarre had notice of your fair approach,
BOYET:
And he and his competitors in oath
BOYET:
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
BOYET:
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt
BOYET:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
BOYET:
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
BOYET:
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
BOYET:
To let you enter his unpeopled house.
BOYET:
Here comes Navarre.
BOYET:
Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants
FERDINAND:
Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
PRINCESS:
'Fair' I give you back again, and 'welcome' I have
PRINCESS:
not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
PRINCESS:
yours, and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
FERDINAND:
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
PRINCESS:
I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
FERDINAND:
Hear me, dear lady, I have sworn an oath.
PRINCESS:
Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
FERDINAND:
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
PRINCESS:
Why, will shall break it, will and nothing else.
FERDINAND:
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
PRINCESS:
Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
PRINCESS:
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
PRINCESS:
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping
PRINCESS:
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
PRINCESS:
And sin to break it.
PRINCESS:
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold
PRINCESS:
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
PRINCESS:
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
PRINCESS:
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
FERDINAND:
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
PRINCESS:
You will the sooner, that I were away,
PRINCESS:
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
BIRON:
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
ROSALINE:
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
BIRON:
I know you did.
ROSALINE:
How needless was it then to ask the question!
BIRON:
You must not be so quick.
ROSALINE:
'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
BIRON:
Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
ROSALINE:
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
BIRON:
What time o' day?
ROSALINE:
The hour that fools should ask.
BIRON:
Now fair befall your mask!
ROSALINE:
Fair fall the face it covers!
BIRON:
And send you many lovers!
ROSALINE:
Amen, so you be none.
BIRON:
Nay, then will I be gone.
FERDINAND:
Madam, your father here doth intimate
FERDINAND:
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
FERDINAND:
Being but the one half of an entire sum
FERDINAND:
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
FERDINAND:
But say that he or we, as neither have,
FERDINAND:
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
FERDINAND:
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
FERDINAND:
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
FERDINAND:
Although not valued to the money's worth.
FERDINAND:
If then the king your father will restore
FERDINAND:
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
FERDINAND:
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
FERDINAND:
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
FERDINAND:
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
FERDINAND:
For here he doth demand to have repaid
FERDINAND:
A hundred thousand crowns, and not demands,
FERDINAND:
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
FERDINAND:
To have his title live in Aquitaine,
FERDINAND:
Which we much rather had depart withal
FERDINAND:
And have the money by our father lent
FERDINAND:
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
FERDINAND:
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
FERDINAND:
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
FERDINAND:
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
FERDINAND:
And go well satisfied to France again.
PRINCESS:
You do the king my father too much wrong
PRINCESS:
And wrong the reputation of your name,
PRINCESS:
In so unseeming to confess receipt
PRINCESS:
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
FERDINAND:
I do protest I never heard of it,
FERDINAND:
And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
FERDINAND:
Or yield up Aquitaine.
PRINCESS:
We arrest your word.
PRINCESS:
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
PRINCESS:
For such a sum from special officers
PRINCESS:
Of Charles his father.
FERDINAND:
Satisfy me so.
BOYET:
So please your grace, the packet is not come
BOYET:
Where that and other specialties are bound
BOYET:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
FERDINAND:
It shall suffice me: at which interview
FERDINAND:
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
FERDINAND:
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
FERDINAND:
As honour without breach of honour may
FERDINAND:
Make tender of to thy true worthiness
FERDINAND:
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates,
FERDINAND:
But here without you shall be so received
FERDINAND:
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
FERDINAND:
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
FERDINAND:
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell
FERDINAND:
To-morrow shall we visit you again.
PRINCESS:
Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
FERDINAND:
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
FERDINAND:
Exit
BIRON:
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
ROSALINE:
Pray you, do my commendations, I would be glad to see it.
BIRON:
I would you heard it groan.
ROSALINE:
Is the fool sick?
BIRON:
Sick at the heart.
ROSALINE:
Alack, let it blood.
BIRON:
Would that do it good?
ROSALINE:
My physic says 'ay.'
BIRON:
Will you prick't with your eye?
ROSALINE:
No point, with my knife.
BIRON:
Now, God save thy life!
ROSALINE:
And yours from long living!
BIRON:
I cannot stay thanksgiving.
BIRON:
Retiring
DUMAIN:
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
BOYET:
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
DUMAIN:
A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
DUMAIN:
Exit
LONGAVILLE:
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
BOYET:
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
LONGAVILLE:
Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
BOYET:
She hath but one for herself, to desire that were a shame.
LONGAVILLE:
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
BOYET:
Her mother's, I have heard.
LONGAVILLE:
God's blessing on your beard!
BOYET:
Good sir, be not offended.
BOYET:
She is an heir of Falconbridge.
LONGAVILLE:
Nay, my choler is ended.
LONGAVILLE:
She is a most sweet lady.
BOYET:
Not unlike, sir, that may be.
BOYET:
Exit LONGAVILLE
BIRON:
What's her name in the cap?
BOYET:
Rosaline, by good hap.
BIRON:
Is she wedded or no?
BOYET:
To her will, sir, or so.
BIRON:
You are welcome, sir: adieu.
BOYET:
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
BOYET:
Exit BIRON
MARIA:
That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord
MARIA:
Not a word with him but a jest.
BOYET:
And every jest but a word.
PRINCESS:
It was well done of you to take him at his word.
BOYET:
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
MARIA:
Two hot sheeps, marry.
BOYET:
And wherefore not ships?
BOYET:
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
MARIA:
You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
BOYET:
So you grant pasture for me.
BOYET:
Offering to kiss her
MARIA:
Not so, gentle beast
MARIA:
My lips are no common, though several they be.
BOYET:
Belonging to whom?
MARIA:
To my fortunes and me.
PRINCESS:
Good wits will be jangling, but, gentles, agree
PRINCESS:
This civil war of wits were much better used
PRINCESS:
On Navarre and his book-men, for here 'tis abused.
BOYET:
If my observation, which very seldom lies,
BOYET:
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
BOYET:
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
PRINCESS:
With what?
BOYET:
With that which we lovers entitle affected.
PRINCESS:
Your reason?
BOYET:
Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
BOYET:
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire
BOYET:
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
BOYET:
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd
BOYET:
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
BOYET:
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be,
BOYET:
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
BOYET:
To feel only looking on fairest of fair
BOYET:
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
BOYET:
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy,
BOYET:
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
BOYET:
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd
BOYET:
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
BOYET:
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
BOYET:
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
BOYET:
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
PRINCESS:
Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
BOYET:
But to speak that in words which his eye hath
BOYET:
disclosed.
BOYET:
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
BOYET:
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
ROSALINE:
Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.
MARIA:
He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
ROSALINE:
Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.
BOYET:
Do you hear, my mad wenches?
MARIA:
No.
BOYET:
What then, do you see?
ROSALINE:
Ay, our way to be gone.
BOYET:
You are too hard for me.
BOYET:
Exeunt
BOYET:
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
BOYET:
ACT III
BOYET:
SCENE I. The same.
BOYET:
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH
BOYET:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Warble, child, make passionate my sense of hearing.
MOTH:
Concolinel.
MOTH:
Singing
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.
MOTH:
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
How meanest thou? brawling in French?
MOTH:
No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
MOTH:
the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
MOTH:
it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
MOTH:
sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
MOTH:
swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
MOTH:
the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
MOTH:
love, with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
MOTH:
your eyes, with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
MOTH:
doublet like a rabbit on a spit, or your hands in
MOTH:
your pocket like a man after the old painting, and
MOTH:
keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
MOTH:
These are complements, these are humours, these
MOTH:
betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
MOTH:
these, and make them men of note--do you note
MOTH:
me?--that most are affected to these.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
How hast thou purchased this experience?
MOTH:
By my penny of observation.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
But O,--but O,--
MOTH:
'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
MOTH:
No, master, the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
MOTH:
love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Almost I had.
MOTH:
Negligent student! learn her by heart.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By heart and in heart, boy.
MOTH:
And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
What wilt thou prove?
MOTH:
A man, if I live, and this, by, in, and without, upon
MOTH:
the instant: by heart you love her, because your
MOTH:
heart cannot come by her, in heart you love her,
MOTH:
because your heart is in love with her, and out of
MOTH:
heart you love her, being out of heart that you
MOTH:
cannot enjoy her.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I am all these three.
MOTH:
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
MOTH:
all.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
MOTH:
A message well sympathized, a horse to be ambassador
MOTH:
for an ass.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
MOTH:
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
MOTH:
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The way is but short: away!
MOTH:
As swift as lead, sir.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
MOTH:
Minime, honest master, or rather, master, no.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I say lead is slow.
MOTH:
You are too swift, sir, to say so
MOTH:
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
He reputes me a cannon, and the bullet, that's he
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I shoot thee at the swain.
MOTH:
Thump then and I flee.
MOTH:
Exit
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
A most acute juvenal, voluble and free of grace!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
My herald is return'd.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD
MOTH:
A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy, begin.
COSTARD:
No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy, no salve in the
COSTARD:
mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
COSTARD:
l'envoy, no l'envoy, no salve, sir, but a plantain!
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By virtue, thou enforcest laughter, thy silly
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
thought my spleen, the heaving of my lungs provokes
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
the word l'envoy for a salve?
MOTH:
Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will example it
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Were still at odds, being but three.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
MOTH:
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Were still at odds, being but three.
MOTH:
Until the goose came out of door,
MOTH:
And stay'd the odds by adding four.
MOTH:
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
MOTH:
my l'envoy.
MOTH:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
MOTH:
Were still at odds, being but three.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Until the goose came out of door,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Staying the odds by adding four.
MOTH:
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
MOTH:
desire more?
COSTARD:
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
COSTARD:
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
COSTARD:
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose
COSTARD:
Let me see, a fat l'envoy, ay, that's a fat goose.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
MOTH:
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
MOTH:
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
COSTARD:
True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
COSTARD:
argument in,
COSTARD:
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought,
COSTARD:
And he ended the market.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
But tell me, how was there a costard broken in a shin?
MOTH:
I will tell you sensibly.
COSTARD:
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy
COSTARD:
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
COSTARD:
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
We will talk no more of this matter.
COSTARD:
Till there be more matter in the shin.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
COSTARD:
O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
COSTARD:
some goose, in this.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
enfreedoming thy person, thou wert immured,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
restrained, captivated, bound.
COSTARD:
True, true, and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance, and,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
bear this significant
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Giving a letter
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
to the country maid Jaquenetta
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
there is remuneration, for the best ward of mine
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Exit
MOTH:
Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
COSTARD:
My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
COSTARD:
Exit MOTH
COSTARD:
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
COSTARD:
O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
COSTARD:
farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
COSTARD:
inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
COSTARD:
remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
COSTARD:
why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
COSTARD:
never buy and sell out of this word.
COSTARD:
Enter BIRON
BIRON:
O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.
COSTARD:
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
COSTARD:
buy for a remuneration?
BIRON:
What is a remuneration?
COSTARD:
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
BIRON:
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
COSTARD:
I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
BIRON:
Stay, slave, I must employ thee
BIRON:
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
BIRON:
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
COSTARD:
When would you have it done, sir?
BIRON:
This afternoon.
COSTARD:
Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.
BIRON:
Thou knowest not what it is.
COSTARD:
I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
BIRON:
Why, villain, thou must know first.
COSTARD:
I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
BIRON:
It must be done this afternoon.
BIRON:
Hark, slave, it is but this
BIRON:
The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
BIRON:
And in her train there is a gentle lady,
BIRON:
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
BIRON:
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her,
BIRON:
And to her white hand see thou do commend
BIRON:
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon, go.
BIRON:
Giving him a shilling
COSTARD:
Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
COSTARD:
a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
COSTARD:
will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!
COSTARD:
Exit
BIRON:
And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip,
BIRON:
A very beadle to a humorous sigh,
BIRON:
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable,
BIRON:
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
BIRON:
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
BIRON:
This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,
BIRON:
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid,
BIRON:
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
BIRON:
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
BIRON:
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
BIRON:
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
BIRON:
Sole imperator and great general
BIRON:
Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
BIRON:
And I to be a corporal of his field,
BIRON:
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
BIRON:
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
BIRON:
A woman, that is like a German clock,
BIRON:
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
BIRON:
And never going aright, being a watch,
BIRON:
But being watch'd that it may still go right!
BIRON:
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all,
BIRON:
And, among three, to love the worst of all,
BIRON:
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
BIRON:
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes,
BIRON:
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
BIRON:
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard
BIRON:
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
BIRON:
To pray for her! Go to, it is a plague
BIRON:
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
BIRON:
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
BIRON:
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan
BIRON:
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
BIRON:
Exit

ACT IV
BIRON:
SCENE I. The same.
BIRON:
Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester, BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE
PRINCESS:
Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
PRINCESS:
Against the steep uprising of the hill?
BOYET:
I know not, but I think it was not he.
PRINCESS:
Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
PRINCESS:
Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch
PRINCESS:
On Saturday we will return to France.
PRINCESS:
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
PRINCESS:
That we must stand and play the murderer in?
Forester:
Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice,
Forester:
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
PRINCESS:
I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
PRINCESS:
And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
Forester:
Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
PRINCESS:
What, what? first praise me and again say no?
PRINCESS:
O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
Forester:
Yes, madam, fair.
PRINCESS:
Nay, never paint me now
PRINCESS:
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
PRINCESS:
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true
PRINCESS:
Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
Forester:
Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
PRINCESS:
See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
PRINCESS:
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
PRINCESS:
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
PRINCESS:
But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
PRINCESS:
And shooting well is then accounted ill.
PRINCESS:
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot
PRINCESS:
Not wounding, pity would not let me do't,
PRINCESS:
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
PRINCESS:
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
PRINCESS:
And out of question so it is sometimes,
PRINCESS:
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
PRINCESS:
When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
PRINCESS:
We bend to that the working of the heart,
PRINCESS:
As I for praise alone now seek to spill
PRINCESS:
The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.
BOYET:
Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
BOYET:
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
BOYET:
Lords o'er their lords?
PRINCESS:
Only for praise: and praise we may afford
PRINCESS:
To any lady that subdues a lord.
BOYET:
Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
BOYET:
Enter COSTARD
COSTARD:
God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
PRINCESS:
Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
COSTARD:
Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
PRINCESS:
The thickest and the tallest.
COSTARD:
The thickest and the tallest! it is so, truth is truth.
COSTARD:
An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
COSTARD:
One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
COSTARD:
Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.
PRINCESS:
What's your will, sir? what's your will?
COSTARD:
I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.
PRINCESS:
O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine
PRINCESS:
Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve,
PRINCESS:
Break up this capon.
BOYET:
I am bound to serve.
BOYET:
This letter is mistook, it importeth none here,
BOYET:
It is writ to Jaquenetta.
PRINCESS:
We will read it, I swear.
PRINCESS:
Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.
PRINCESS:
Reads
BOYET:
'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible,
BOYET:
true, that thou art beauteous, truth itself, that
BOYET:
thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
BOYET:
than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
BOYET:
commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
BOYET:
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
BOYET:
eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
BOYET:
Zenelophon, and he it was that might rightly say,
BOYET:
Veni, vidi, vici, which to annothanize in the
BOYET:
vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
BOYET:
came, saw, and overcame: he came, one, saw two,
BOYET:
overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
BOYET:
come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
BOYET:
whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
BOYET:
beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
BOYET:
conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
BOYET:
The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
BOYET:
beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
BOYET:
side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
BOYET:
both. I am the king, for so stands the comparison
BOYET:
thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
BOYET:
Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
BOYET:
thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
BOYET:
will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes,
BOYET:
for tittles? titles, for thyself? me. Thus,
BOYET:
expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
BOYET:
my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
BOYET:
part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
BOYET:
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
BOYET:
Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
BOYET:
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
BOYET:
Submissive fall his princely feet before,
BOYET:
And he from forage will incline to play
BOYET:
But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
BOYET:
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
PRINCESS:
What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
PRINCESS:
What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?
BOYET:
I am much deceived but I remember the style.
PRINCESS:
Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.
BOYET:
This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court,
BOYET:
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
BOYET:
To the prince and his bookmates.
PRINCESS:
Thou fellow, a word
PRINCESS:
Who gave thee this letter?
COSTARD:
I told you, my lord.
PRINCESS:
To whom shouldst thou give it?
COSTARD:
From my lord to my lady.
PRINCESS:
From which lord to which lady?
COSTARD:
From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
COSTARD:
To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.
PRINCESS:
Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
PRINCESS:
To ROSALINE
PRINCESS:
Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.
PRINCESS:
Exeunt PRINCESS and train
BOYET:
Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?
ROSALINE:
Shall I teach you to know?
BOYET:
Ay, my continent of beauty.
ROSALINE:
Why, she that bears the bow.
ROSALINE:
Finely put off!
BOYET:
My lady goes to kill horns, but, if thou marry,
BOYET:
Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
BOYET:
Finely put on!
ROSALINE:
Well, then, I am the shooter.
BOYET:
And who is your deer?
ROSALINE:
If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
ROSALINE:
Finely put on, indeed!
MARIA:
You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
MARIA:
at the brow.
BOYET:
But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?
ROSALINE:
Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
ROSALINE:
a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
ROSALINE:
touching the hit it?
BOYET:
So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
BOYET:
woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
BOYET:
wench, as touching the hit it.
ROSALINE:
Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
ROSALINE:
Thou canst not hit it, my good man.
BOYET:
An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
BOYET:
An I cannot, another can.
BOYET:
Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE
COSTARD:
By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!
MARIA:
A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.
BOYET:
A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
BOYET:
Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.
MARIA:
Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.
COSTARD:
Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.
BOYET:
An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
COSTARD:
Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
MARIA:
Come, come, you talk greasily, your lips grow foul.
COSTARD:
She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.
BOYET:
I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.
BOYET:
Exeunt BOYET and MARIA
COSTARD:
By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
COSTARD:
Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
COSTARD:
O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
COSTARD:
vulgar wit!
COSTARD:
When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
COSTARD:
were, so fit.
COSTARD:
Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
COSTARD:
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
COSTARD:
To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
COSTARD:
will swear!
COSTARD:
And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
COSTARD:
Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
COSTARD:
Sola, sola!
COSTARD:
Shout within

Exit COSTARD, running

LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
COSTARD:
SCENE II. The same.
COSTARD:
Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL
SIR NATHANIEL:
Very reverend sport, truly, and done in the testimony
SIR NATHANIEL:
of a good conscience.
HOLOFERNES:
The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood, ripe
HOLOFERNES:
as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
HOLOFERNES:
the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven,
HOLOFERNES:
and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
HOLOFERNES:
the soil, the land, the earth.
SIR NATHANIEL:
Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
SIR NATHANIEL:
varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
SIR NATHANIEL:
assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.
HOLOFERNES:
Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
DULL:
'Twas not a haud credo, 'twas a pricket.
HOLOFERNES:
Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
HOLOFERNES:
insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
HOLOFERNES:
explication, facere, as it were, replication, or
HOLOFERNES:
rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
HOLOFERNES:
inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
HOLOFERNES:
uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
HOLOFERNES:
unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
HOLOFERNES:
insert again my haud credo for a deer.
DULL:
I said the deer was not a haud credo, twas a pricket.
HOLOFERNES:
Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
HOLOFERNES:
O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!
SIR NATHANIEL:
Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
SIR NATHANIEL:
in a book, he hath not eat paper, as it were, he
SIR NATHANIEL:
hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
SIR NATHANIEL:
replenished, he is only an animal, only sensible in
SIR NATHANIEL:
the duller parts
SIR NATHANIEL:
And such barren plants are set before us, that we
SIR NATHANIEL:
thankful should be,
SIR NATHANIEL:
Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
SIR NATHANIEL:
do fructify in us more than he.
SIR NATHANIEL:
For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
SIR NATHANIEL:
So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school
SIR NATHANIEL:
But omne bene, say I, being of an old father's mind,
SIR NATHANIEL:
Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.
DULL:
You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
DULL:
What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
DULL:
weeks old as yet?
HOLOFERNES:
Dictynna, goodman Dull, Dictynna, goodman Dull.
DULL:
What is Dictynna?
SIR NATHANIEL:
A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
HOLOFERNES:
The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
HOLOFERNES:
And raught not to five weeks when he came to
HOLOFERNES:
five-score.
HOLOFERNES:
The allusion holds in the exchange.
DULL:
'Tis true indeed, the collusion holds in the exchange.
HOLOFERNES:
God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
HOLOFERNES:
in the exchange.
DULL:
And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange, for
DULL:
the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
DULL:
that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.
HOLOFERNES:
Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
HOLOFERNES:
on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
HOLOFERNES:
ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.
SIR NATHANIEL:
Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall
SIR NATHANIEL:
please you to abrogate scurrility.
HOLOFERNES:
I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
HOLOFERNES:
The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
HOLOFERNES:
pleasing pricket,
HOLOFERNES:
Some say a sore, but not a sore, till now made
HOLOFERNES:
sore with shooting.
HOLOFERNES:
The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
HOLOFERNES:
from thicket,
HOLOFERNES:
Or pricket sore, or else sorel, the people fall a-hooting.
HOLOFERNES:
If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
HOLOFERNES:
one sorel.
HOLOFERNES:
Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.
SIR NATHANIEL:
A rare talent!
DULL:
[Aside]  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
DULL:
him with a talent.
HOLOFERNES:
This is a gift that I have, simple, simple, a
HOLOFERNES:
foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
HOLOFERNES:
shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
HOLOFERNES:
revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
HOLOFERNES:
memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
HOLOFERNES:
delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
HOLOFERNES:
gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
HOLOFERNES:
thankful for it.
SIR NATHANIEL:
Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my
SIR NATHANIEL:
parishioners, for their sons are well tutored by
SIR NATHANIEL:
you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
SIR NATHANIEL:
you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.
HOLOFERNES:
Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
HOLOFERNES:
want no instruction, if their daughters be capable,
HOLOFERNES:
I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
HOLOFERNES:
loquitur, a soul feminine saluteth us.
HOLOFERNES:
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD
JAQUENETTA:
God give you good morrow, master Parson.
HOLOFERNES:
Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
HOLOFERNES:
pierced, which is the one?
COSTARD:
Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.
HOLOFERNES:
Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
HOLOFERNES:
tuft of earth, fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
HOLOFERNES:
for a swine: 'tis pretty, it is well.
JAQUENETTA:
Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
JAQUENETTA:
letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
JAQUENETTA:
from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.
HOLOFERNES:
Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
HOLOFERNES:
Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
HOLOFERNES:
may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice,
HOLOFERNES:
Venetia, Venetia,
HOLOFERNES:
Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
HOLOFERNES:
Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
HOLOFERNES:
not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
HOLOFERNES:
Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
HOLOFERNES:
as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?
SIR NATHANIEL:
Ay, sir, and very learned.
HOLOFERNES:
Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse, lege, domine.
SIR NATHANIEL:
[Reads]
SIR NATHANIEL:
If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
SIR NATHANIEL:
Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
SIR NATHANIEL:
Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove
SIR NATHANIEL:
Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like
SIR NATHANIEL:
osiers bow'd.
SIR NATHANIEL:
Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
SIR NATHANIEL:
Where all those pleasures live that art would
SIR NATHANIEL:
comprehend
SIR NATHANIEL:
If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice,
SIR NATHANIEL:
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
SIR NATHANIEL:
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder,
SIR NATHANIEL:
Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire
SIR NATHANIEL:
Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
SIR NATHANIEL:
Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
SIR NATHANIEL:
Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
SIR NATHANIEL:
That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.
HOLOFERNES:
You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
HOLOFERNES:
accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
HOLOFERNES:
only numbers ratified, but, for the elegancy,
HOLOFERNES:
facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
HOLOFERNES:
Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
HOLOFERNES:
but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
HOLOFERNES:
fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing
HOLOFERNES:
so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
HOLOFERNES:
the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
HOLOFERNES:
was this directed to you?
JAQUENETTA:
Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
JAQUENETTA:
queen's lords.
HOLOFERNES:
I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
HOLOFERNES:
snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
HOLOFERNES:
Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
HOLOFERNES:
the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
HOLOFERNES:
to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
HOLOFERNES:
desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
HOLOFERNES:
Biron is one of the votaries with the king, and here
HOLOFERNES:
he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
HOLOFERNES:
queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
HOLOFERNES:
progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
HOLOFERNES:
sweet, deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
HOLOFERNES:
king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
HOLOFERNES:
compliment, I forgive thy duty, adieu.
JAQUENETTA:
Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
COSTARD:
Have with thee, my girl.
COSTARD:
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA
SIR NATHANIEL:
Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
SIR NATHANIEL:
religiously, and, as a certain father saith,--
HOLOFERNES:
Sir tell me not of the father, I do fear colourable
HOLOFERNES:
colours. But to return to the verses: did they
HOLOFERNES:
please you, Sir Nathaniel?
SIR NATHANIEL:
Marvellous well for the pen.
HOLOFERNES:
I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
HOLOFERNES:
of mine, where, if, before repast, it shall please
HOLOFERNES:
you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
HOLOFERNES:
privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
HOLOFERNES:
child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto, where I
HOLOFERNES:
will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
HOLOFERNES:
neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
HOLOFERNES:
beseech your society.
SIR NATHANIEL:
And thank you too, for society, saith the text, is
SIR NATHANIEL:
the happiness of life.
HOLOFERNES:
And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
HOLOFERNES:
To DULL
HOLOFERNES:
Sir, I do invite you too, you shall not
HOLOFERNES:
say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
HOLOFERNES:
their game, and we will to our recreation.
HOLOFERNES:
Exeunt

LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
HOLOFERNES:
SCENE III. The same.
HOLOFERNES:
Enter BIRON, with a paper
BIRON:
The king he is hunting the deer, I am coursing
BIRON:
myself: they have pitched a toil, I am toiling in
BIRON:
a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
BIRON:
word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
BIRON:
the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
BIRON:
proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
BIRON:
Ajax: it kills sheep, it kills me, I a sheep
BIRON:
well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
BIRON:
I do, hang me, i' faith, I will not. O, but her
BIRON:
eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
BIRON:
love her, yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
BIRON:
in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
BIRON:
heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
BIRON:
and to be melancholy, and here is part of my rhyme,
BIRON:
and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
BIRON:
sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
BIRON:
it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
BIRON:
fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
BIRON:
a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
BIRON:
with a paper: God give him grace to groan!
BIRON:
Stands aside
BIRON:
Enter FERDINAND, with a paper
FERDINAND:
Ay me!
BIRON:
[Aside]  Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid
BIRON:
thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the
BIRON:
left pap. In faith, secrets!
FERDINAND:
[Reads]
FERDINAND:
So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
FERDINAND:
To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
FERDINAND:
As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
FERDINAND:
The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
FERDINAND:
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
FERDINAND:
Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
FERDINAND:
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light,
FERDINAND:
Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep
FERDINAND:
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee,
FERDINAND:
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
FERDINAND:
Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
FERDINAND:
And they thy glory through my grief will show
FERDINAND:
But do not love thyself, then thou wilt keep
FERDINAND:
My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
FERDINAND:
O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
FERDINAND:
No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
FERDINAND:
How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper
FERDINAND:
Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?
FERDINAND:
Steps aside
FERDINAND:
What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.
BIRON:
Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
BIRON:
Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper
LONGAVILLE:
Ay me, I am forsworn!
BIRON:
Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.
FERDINAND:
In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!
BIRON:
One drunkard loves another of the name.
LONGAVILLE:
Am I the first that have been perjured so?
BIRON:
I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know
BIRON:
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
BIRON:
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.
LONGAVILLE:
I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move
LONGAVILLE:
O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
LONGAVILLE:
These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.
BIRON:
O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose
BIRON:
Disfigure not his slop.
LONGAVILLE:
This same shall go.
LONGAVILLE:
Reads
LONGAVILLE:
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
LONGAVILLE:
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
LONGAVILLE:
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
LONGAVILLE:
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
LONGAVILLE:
A woman I forswore, but I will prove,
LONGAVILLE:
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee
LONGAVILLE:
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love,
LONGAVILLE:
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
LONGAVILLE:
Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is
LONGAVILLE:
Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
LONGAVILLE:
Exhalest this vapour-vow, in thee it is
LONGAVILLE:
If broken then, it is no fault of mine
LONGAVILLE:
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
LONGAVILLE:
To lose an oath to win a paradise?
BIRON:
This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
BIRON:
A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
BIRON:
God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.
LONGAVILLE:
By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.
LONGAVILLE:
Steps aside
BIRON:
All hid, all hid, an old infant play.
BIRON:
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
BIRON:
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
BIRON:
More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
BIRON:
Enter DUMAIN, with a paper
BIRON:
Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
DUMAIN:
O most divine Kate!
BIRON:
O most profane coxcomb!
DUMAIN:
By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!
BIRON:
By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.
DUMAIN:
Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.
BIRON:
An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.
DUMAIN:
As upright as the cedar.
BIRON:
Stoop, I say,
BIRON:
Her shoulder is with child.
DUMAIN:
As fair as day.
BIRON:
Ay, as some days, but then no sun must shine.
DUMAIN:
O that I had my wish!
LONGAVILLE:
And I had mine!
FERDINAND:
And I mine too, good Lord!
BIRON:
Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?
DUMAIN:
I would forget her, but a fever she
DUMAIN:
Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.
BIRON:
A fever in your blood! why, then incision
BIRON:
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!
DUMAIN:
Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
BIRON:
Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.
DUMAIN:
[Reads]
DUMAIN:
On a day--alack the day!--
DUMAIN:
Love, whose month is ever May,
DUMAIN:
Spied a blossom passing fair
DUMAIN:
Playing in the wanton air
DUMAIN:
Through the velvet leaves the wind,
DUMAIN:
All unseen, can passage find,
DUMAIN:
That the lover, sick to death,
DUMAIN:
Wish himself the heaven's breath.
DUMAIN:
Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow,
DUMAIN:
Air, would I might triumph so!
DUMAIN:
But, alack, my hand is sworn
DUMAIN:
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn,
DUMAIN:
Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
DUMAIN:
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
DUMAIN:
Do not call it sin in me,
DUMAIN:
That I am forsworn for thee,
DUMAIN:
Thou for whom Jove would swear
DUMAIN:
Juno but an Ethiope were,
DUMAIN:
And deny himself for Jove,
DUMAIN:
Turning mortal for thy love.
DUMAIN:
This will I send, and something else more plain,
DUMAIN:
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
DUMAIN:
O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
DUMAIN:
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
DUMAIN:
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note,
DUMAIN:
For none offend where all alike do dote.
LONGAVILLE:
[Advancing]  Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
LONGAVILLE:
You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
LONGAVILLE:
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.
FERDINAND:
[Advancing]  Come, sir, you blush, as his your case is such,
FERDINAND:
You chide at him, offending twice as much,
FERDINAND:
You do not love Maria, Longaville
FERDINAND:
Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
FERDINAND:
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
FERDINAND:
His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
FERDINAND:
I have been closely shrouded in this bush
FERDINAND:
And mark'd you both and for you both did blush
FERDINAND:
I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
FERDINAND:
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion
FERDINAND:
Ay me! says one, O Jove! the other cries,
FERDINAND:
One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes
FERDINAND:
To LONGAVILLE
FERDINAND:
You would for paradise break faith, and troth,
FERDINAND:
To DUMAIN
FERDINAND:
And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
FERDINAND:
What will Biron say when that he shall hear
FERDINAND:
Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
FERDINAND:
How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
FERDINAND:
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
FERDINAND:
For all the wealth that ever I did see,
FERDINAND:
I would not have him know so much by me.
BIRON:
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
BIRON:
Advancing
BIRON:
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
BIRON:
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
BIRON:
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
BIRON:
Your eyes do make no coaches, in your tears
BIRON:
There is no certain princess that appears,
BIRON:
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing,
BIRON:
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
BIRON:
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
BIRON:
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
BIRON:
You found his mote, the king your mote did see,
BIRON:
But I a beam do find in each of three.
BIRON:
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
BIRON:
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
BIRON:
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
BIRON:
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
BIRON:
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
BIRON:
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
BIRON:
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
BIRON:
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
BIRON:
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
BIRON:
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
BIRON:
And where my liege's? all about the breast
BIRON:
A caudle, ho!
FERDINAND:
Too bitter is thy jest.
FERDINAND:
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?
BIRON:
Not you to me, but I betray'd by you
BIRON:
I, that am honest, I, that hold it sin
BIRON:
To break the vow I am engaged in,
BIRON:
I am betray'd, by keeping company
BIRON:
With men like men of inconstancy.
BIRON:
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
BIRON:
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
BIRON:
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
BIRON:
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
BIRON:
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
BIRON:
A leg, a limb?
FERDINAND:
Soft! whither away so fast?
FERDINAND:
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
BIRON:
I post from love: good lover, let me go.
BIRON:
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD
JAQUENETTA:
God bless the king!
FERDINAND:
What present hast thou there?
COSTARD:
Some certain treason.
FERDINAND:
What makes treason here?
COSTARD:
Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
FERDINAND:
If it mar nothing neither,
FERDINAND:
The treason and you go in peace away together.
JAQUENETTA:
I beseech your grace, let this letter be read
JAQUENETTA:
Our parson misdoubts it, 'twas treason, he said.
FERDINAND:
Biron, read it over.
FERDINAND:
Giving him the paper
FERDINAND:
Where hadst thou it?
JAQUENETTA:
Of Costard.
FERDINAND:
Where hadst thou it?
COSTARD:
Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
COSTARD:
BIRON tears the letter
FERDINAND:
How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?
BIRON:
A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.
LONGAVILLE:
It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
DUMAIN:
It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
DUMAIN:
Gathering up the pieces
BIRON:
[To COSTARD]  Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
BIRON:
born to do me shame.
BIRON:
Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.
FERDINAND:
What?
BIRON:
That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess
BIRON:
He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
BIRON:
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
BIRON:
O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.
DUMAIN:
Now the number is even.
BIRON:
True, true, we are four.
BIRON:
Will these turtles be gone?
FERDINAND:
Hence, sirs, away!
COSTARD:
Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
COSTARD:
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA
BIRON:
Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
BIRON:
As true we are as flesh and blood can be
BIRON:
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face,
BIRON:
Young blood doth not obey an old decree
BIRON:
We cannot cross the cause why we were born,
BIRON:
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.
FERDINAND:
What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
BIRON:
Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
BIRON:
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
BIRON:
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
BIRON:
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
BIRON:
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
BIRON:
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
BIRON:
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
BIRON:
That is not blinded by her majesty?
FERDINAND:
What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
FERDINAND:
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon,
FERDINAND:
She an attending star, scarce seen a light.
BIRON:
My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron
BIRON:
O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
BIRON:
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
BIRON:
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
BIRON:
Where several worthies make one dignity,
BIRON:
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
BIRON:
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
BIRON:
Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not
BIRON:
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
BIRON:
She passes praise, then praise too short doth blot.
BIRON:
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
BIRON:
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye
BIRON:
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
BIRON:
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy
BIRON:
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.
FERDINAND:
By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
BIRON:
Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
BIRON:
A wife of such wood were felicity.
BIRON:
O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
BIRON:
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
BIRON:
If that she learn not of her eye to look
BIRON:
No face is fair that is not full so black.
FERDINAND:
O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
FERDINAND:
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night,
FERDINAND:
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
BIRON:
Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
BIRON:
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
BIRON:
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
BIRON:
Should ravish doters with a false aspect,
BIRON:
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
BIRON:
Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
BIRON:
For native blood is counted painting now,
BIRON:
And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
BIRON:
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
DUMAIN:
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
LONGAVILLE:
And since her time are colliers counted bright.
FERDINAND:
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
DUMAIN:
Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
BIRON:
Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
BIRON:
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.
FERDINAND:
'Twere good, yours did, for, sir, to tell you plain,
FERDINAND:
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.
BIRON:
I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
FERDINAND:
No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
DUMAIN:
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
LONGAVILLE:
Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
BIRON:
O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
BIRON:
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
DUMAIN:
O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
DUMAIN:
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.
FERDINAND:
But what of this? are we not all in love?
BIRON:
Nothing so sure, and thereby all forsworn.
FERDINAND:
Then leave this chat, and, good Biron, now prove
FERDINAND:
Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.
DUMAIN:
Ay, marry, there, some flattery for this evil.
LONGAVILLE:
O, some authority how to proceed,
LONGAVILLE:
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.
DUMAIN:
Some salve for perjury.
BIRON:
'Tis more than need.
BIRON:
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
BIRON:
Consider what you first did swear unto,
BIRON:
To fast, to study, and to see no woman,
BIRON:
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
BIRON:
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young,
BIRON:
And abstinence engenders maladies.
BIRON:
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
BIRON:
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
BIRON:
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
BIRON:
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
BIRON:
Have found the ground of study's excellence
BIRON:
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
BIRON:
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive,  They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
BIRON:
Why, universal plodding poisons up
BIRON:
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
BIRON:
As motion and long-during action tires
BIRON:
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
BIRON:
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
BIRON:
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
BIRON:
And study too, the causer of your vow,
BIRON:
For where is any author in the world
BIRON:
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
BIRON:
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
BIRON:
And where we are our learning likewise is
BIRON:
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
BIRON:
Do we not likewise see our learning there?
BIRON:
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
BIRON:
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
BIRON:
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
BIRON:
In leaden contemplation have found out
BIRON:
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
BIRON:
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
BIRON:
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain,
BIRON:
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
BIRON:
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
BIRON:
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
BIRON:
Lives not alone immured in the brain,
BIRON:
But, with the motion of all elements,
BIRON:
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
BIRON:
And gives to every power a double power,
BIRON:
Above their functions and their offices.
BIRON:
It adds a precious seeing to the eye,
BIRON:
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind,
BIRON:
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
BIRON:
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd
BIRON:
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
BIRON:
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails,
BIRON:
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste
BIRON:
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
BIRON:
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
BIRON:
Subtle as Sphinx, as sweet and musical
BIRON:
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair
BIRON:
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
BIRON:
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
BIRON:
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
BIRON:
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs,
BIRON:
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
BIRON:
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
BIRON:
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive
BIRON:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire,
BIRON:
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
BIRON:
That show, contain and nourish all the world
BIRON:
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
BIRON:
Then fools you were these women to forswear,
BIRON:
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
BIRON:
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
BIRON:
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
BIRON:
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
BIRON:
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
BIRON:
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
BIRON:
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
BIRON:
It is religion to be thus forsworn,
BIRON:
For charity itself fulfills the law,
BIRON:
And who can sever love from charity?
FERDINAND:
Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
BIRON:
Advance your standards, and upon them, lords,
BIRON:
Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
BIRON:
In conflict that you get the sun of them.
LONGAVILLE:
Now to plain-dealing, lay these glozes by
LONGAVILLE:
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
FERDINAND:
And win them too: therefore let us devise
FERDINAND:
Some entertainment for them in their tents.
BIRON:
First, from the park let us conduct them thither,
BIRON:
Then homeward every man attach the hand
BIRON:
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
BIRON:
We will with some strange pastime solace them,
BIRON:
Such as the shortness of the time can shape,
BIRON:
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
BIRON:
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.
FERDINAND:
Away, away! no time shall be omitted
FERDINAND:
That will betime, and may by us be fitted.
BIRON:
Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn,
BIRON:
And justice always whirls in equal measure
BIRON:
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn,
BIRON:
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.
BIRON:
Exeunt
BIRON:
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
BIRON:
ACT V
BIRON:
SCENE I. The same.
BIRON:
Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL
HOLOFERNES:
Satis quod sufficit.
SIR NATHANIEL:
I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
SIR NATHANIEL:
have been sharp and sententious, pleasant without
SIR NATHANIEL:
scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
SIR NATHANIEL:
impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
SIR NATHANIEL:
out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
SIR NATHANIEL:
a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
SIR NATHANIEL:
nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.
HOLOFERNES:
Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
HOLOFERNES:
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
HOLOFERNES:
ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
HOLOFERNES:
behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
HOLOFERNES:
too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
HOLOFERNES:
were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.
SIR NATHANIEL:
A most singular and choice epithet.
SIR NATHANIEL:
Draws out his table-book
HOLOFERNES:
He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
HOLOFERNES:
than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
HOLOFERNES:
fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
HOLOFERNES:
point-devise companions, such rackers of
HOLOFERNES:
orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
HOLOFERNES:
say doubt, det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
HOLOFERNES:
e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf,
HOLOFERNES:
half, hauf, neighbour vocatur nebor, neigh
HOLOFERNES:
abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
HOLOFERNES:
would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
HOLOFERNES:
insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.
SIR NATHANIEL:
Laus Deo, bene intelligo.
HOLOFERNES:
Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
HOLOFERNES:
'twill serve.
SIR NATHANIEL:
Videsne quis venit?
HOLOFERNES:
Video, et gaudeo.
HOLOFERNES:
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD
HOLOFERNES:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Chirrah!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
To MOTH
HOLOFERNES:
Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
HOLOFERNES:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Men of peace, well encountered.
HOLOFERNES:
Most military sir, salutation.
MOTH:
[Aside to COSTARD]  They have been at a great feast
MOTH:
of languages, and stolen the scraps.
COSTARD:
O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
COSTARD:
I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word,
COSTARD:
for thou art not so long by the head as
COSTARD:
honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
COSTARD:
swallowed than a flap-dragon.
MOTH:
Peace! the peal begins.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
[To HOLOFERNES]  Monsieur, are you not lettered?
MOTH:
Yes, yes, he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
MOTH:
b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?
HOLOFERNES:
Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
MOTH:
Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
HOLOFERNES:
Quis, quis, thou consonant?
MOTH:
The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them, or
MOTH:
the fifth, if I.
HOLOFERNES:
I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--
MOTH:
The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!
MOTH:
Offered by a child to an old man, which is wit-old.
HOLOFERNES:
What is the figure? what is the figure?
MOTH:
Horns.
HOLOFERNES:
Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.
MOTH:
Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
MOTH:
your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.
COSTARD:
An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
COSTARD:
have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
COSTARD:
remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
COSTARD:
purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
COSTARD:
the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
COSTARD:
bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
COSTARD:
Go to, thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
COSTARD:
ends, as they say.
HOLOFERNES:
O, I smell false Latin, dunghill for unguem.
HOLOFERNES:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
charge-house on the top of the mountain?
HOLOFERNES:
Or mons, the hill.
HOLOFERNES:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
HOLOFERNES:
I do, sans question.
HOLOFERNES:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
affection to congratulate the princess at her
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
rude multitude call the afternoon.
HOLOFERNES:
The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
HOLOFERNES:
liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon
HOLOFERNES:
the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
HOLOFERNES:
assure you, sir, I do assure.
HOLOFERNES:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
remember thy courtesy, I beseech thee, apparel thy
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
head: and among other important and most serious
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
with my excrement, with my mustachio, but, sweet
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
travel, that hath seen the world, but let that pass.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
curate and your sweet self are good at such
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
crave your assistance.
HOLOFERNES:
Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
HOLOFERNES:
Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
HOLOFERNES:
show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
HOLOFERNES:
our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
HOLOFERNES:
gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
HOLOFERNES:
the princess, I say none so fit as to present the
HOLOFERNES:
Nine Worthies.
SIR NATHANIEL:
Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
HOLOFERNES:
Joshua, yourself, myself and this gallant gentleman,
HOLOFERNES:
Judas Maccabaeus, this swain, because of his great
HOLOFERNES:
limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great, the
HOLOFERNES:
page, Hercules,--
HOLOFERNES:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Pardon, sir, error: he is not quantity enough for
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.
HOLOFERNES:
Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
HOLOFERNES:
minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
HOLOFERNES:
snake, and I will have an apology for that purpose.
MOTH:
An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
MOTH:
hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
MOTH:
crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
MOTH:
offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
For the rest of the Worthies?--
HOLOFERNES:
I will play three myself.
MOTH:
Thrice-worthy gentleman!
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Shall I tell you a thing?
HOLOFERNES:
We attend.
HOLOFERNES:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
beseech you, follow.
HOLOFERNES:
Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.
DULL:
Nor understood none neither, sir.
HOLOFERNES:
Allons! we will employ thee.
DULL:
I'll make one in a dance, or so, or I will play
DULL:
On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.
HOLOFERNES:
Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!
HOLOFERNES:
Exeunt
HOLOFERNES:
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
HOLOFERNES:
SCENE II. The same.
HOLOFERNES:
Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA
PRINCESS:
Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
PRINCESS:
If fairings come thus plentifully in
PRINCESS:
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
PRINCESS:
Look you what I have from the loving king.
ROSALINE:
Madame, came nothing else along with that?
PRINCESS:
Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
PRINCESS:
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
PRINCESS:
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
PRINCESS:
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.
ROSALINE:
That was the way to make his godhead wax,
ROSALINE:
For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
KATHARINE:
Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
ROSALINE:
You'll ne'er be friends with him, a' kill'd your sister.
KATHARINE:
He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy,
KATHARINE:
And so she died: had she been light, like you,
KATHARINE:
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
KATHARINE:
She might ha' been a grandam ere she died
KATHARINE:
And so may you, for a light heart lives long.
ROSALINE:
What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
KATHARINE:
A light condition in a beauty dark.
ROSALINE:
We need more light to find your meaning out.
KATHARINE:
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff,
KATHARINE:
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
ROSALINE:
Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
KATHARINE:
So do not you, for you are a light wench.
ROSALINE:
Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.
KATHARINE:
You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
ROSALINE:
Great reason, for 'past cure is still past care.'
PRINCESS:
Well bandied both, a set of wit well play'd.
PRINCESS:
But Rosaline, you have a favour too
PRINCESS:
Who sent it? and what is it?
ROSALINE:
I would you knew
ROSALINE:
An if my face were but as fair as yours,
ROSALINE:
My favour were as great, be witness this.
ROSALINE:
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron
ROSALINE:
The numbers true, and, were the numbering too,
ROSALINE:
I were the fairest goddess on the ground
ROSALINE:
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
ROSALINE:
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!
PRINCESS:
Any thing like?
ROSALINE:
Much in the letters, nothing in the praise.
PRINCESS:
Beauteous as ink, a good conclusion.
KATHARINE:
Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
ROSALINE:
'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
ROSALINE:
My red dominical, my golden letter
ROSALINE:
O, that your face were not so full of O's!
KATHARINE:
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
PRINCESS:
But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
KATHARINE:
Madam, this glove.
PRINCESS:
Did he not send you twain?
KATHARINE:
Yes, madam, and moreover
KATHARINE:
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
KATHARINE:
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
KATHARINE:
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
MARIA:
This and these pearls to me sent Longaville
MARIA:
The letter is too long by half a mile.
PRINCESS:
I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
PRINCESS:
The chain were longer and the letter short?
MARIA:
Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
PRINCESS:
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
ROSALINE:
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
ROSALINE:
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go
ROSALINE:
O that I knew he were but in by the week!
ROSALINE:
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
ROSALINE:
And wait the season and observe the times
ROSALINE:
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
ROSALINE:
And shape his service wholly to my hests
ROSALINE:
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
ROSALINE:
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
ROSALINE:
That he should be my fool and I his fate.
PRINCESS:
None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
PRINCESS:
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
PRINCESS:
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
PRINCESS:
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
ROSALINE:
The blood of youth burns not with such excess
ROSALINE:
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
MARIA:
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
MARIA:
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote,
MARIA:
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
MARIA:
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
PRINCESS:
Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
PRINCESS:
Enter BOYET
BOYET:
O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?
PRINCESS:
Thy news Boyet?
BOYET:
Prepare, madam, prepare!
BOYET:
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
BOYET:
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
BOYET:
Armed in arguments, you'll be surprised
BOYET:
Muster your wits, stand in your own defence,
BOYET:
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
PRINCESS:
Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
PRINCESS:
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.
BOYET:
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
BOYET:
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour,
BOYET:
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
BOYET:
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
BOYET:
The king and his companions: warily
BOYET:
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
BOYET:
And overheard what you shall overhear,
BOYET:
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
BOYET:
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
BOYET:
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage
BOYET:
Action and accent did they teach him there,
BOYET:
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
BOYET:
And ever and anon they made a doubt
BOYET:
Presence majestical would put him out,
BOYET:
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see,
BOYET:
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
BOYET:
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil,
BOYET:
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
BOYET:
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
BOYET:
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder
BOYET:
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
BOYET:
A better speech was never spoke before,
BOYET:
Another, with his finger and his thumb,
BOYET:
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come,'
BOYET:
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well,'
BOYET:
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
BOYET:
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
BOYET:
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
BOYET:
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
BOYET:
To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.
PRINCESS:
But what, but what, come they to visit us?
BOYET:
They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
BOYET:
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
BOYET:
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance,
BOYET:
And every one his love-feat will advance
BOYET:
Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
BOYET:
By favours several which they did bestow.
PRINCESS:
And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd,
PRINCESS:
For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd,
PRINCESS:
And not a man of them shall have the grace,
PRINCESS:
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
PRINCESS:
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
PRINCESS:
And then the king will court thee for his dear,
PRINCESS:
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
PRINCESS:
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
PRINCESS:
And change your favours too, so shall your loves
PRINCESS:
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.
ROSALINE:
Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
KATHARINE:
But in this changing what is your intent?
PRINCESS:
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs
PRINCESS:
They do it but in mocking merriment,
PRINCESS:
And mock for mock is only my intent.
PRINCESS:
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
PRINCESS:
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
PRINCESS:
Upon the next occasion that we meet,
PRINCESS:
With visages displayed, to talk and greet.
ROSALINE:
But shall we dance, if they desire to't?
PRINCESS:
No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
PRINCESS:
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
PRINCESS:
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
BOYET:
Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
BOYET:
And quite divorce his memory from his part.
PRINCESS:
Therefore I do it, and I make no doubt
PRINCESS:
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
PRINCESS:
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
PRINCESS:
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own
PRINCESS:
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
PRINCESS:
And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
PRINCESS:
Trumpets sound within
BOYET:
The trumpet sounds: be mask'd, the maskers come.
BOYET:
The Ladies mask
BOYET:
Enter Blackamoors with music, MOTH, FERDINAND,  BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked
MOTH:
All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--
BOYET:
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
MOTH:
A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
MOTH:
The Ladies turn their backs to him
MOTH:
That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!
BIRON:
[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!
MOTH:
That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--
BOYET:
True, out indeed.
MOTH:
Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
MOTH:
Not to behold--
BIRON:
[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.
MOTH:
Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
MOTH:
--with your sun-beamed eyes--
BOYET:
They will not answer to that epithet,
BOYET:
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'
MOTH:
They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
BIRON:
Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
BIRON:
Exit MOTH
ROSALINE:
What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet
ROSALINE:
If they do speak our language, 'tis our will
ROSALINE:
That some plain man recount their purposes
ROSALINE:
Know what they would.
BOYET:
What would you with the princess?
BIRON:
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
ROSALINE:
What would they, say they?
BOYET:
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
ROSALINE:
Why, that they have, and bid them so be gone.
BOYET:
She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
FERDINAND:
Say to her, we have measured many miles
FERDINAND:
To tread a measure with her on this grass.
BOYET:
They say, that they have measured many a mile
BOYET:
To tread a measure with you on this grass.
ROSALINE:
It is not so. Ask them how many inches
ROSALINE:
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
ROSALINE:
The measure then of one is easily told.
BOYET:
If to come hither you have measured miles,
BOYET:
And many miles, the princess bids you tell
BOYET:
How many inches doth fill up one mile.
BIRON:
Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.
BOYET:
She hears herself.
ROSALINE:
How many weary steps,
ROSALINE:
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
ROSALINE:
Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
BIRON:
We number nothing that we spend for you
BIRON:
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
BIRON:
That we may do it still without accompt.
BIRON:
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
BIRON:
That we, like savages, may worship it.
ROSALINE:
My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
FERDINAND:
Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
FERDINAND:
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
FERDINAND:
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.
ROSALINE:
O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter,
ROSALINE:
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.
FERDINAND:
Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
FERDINAND:
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
ROSALINE:
Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
ROSALINE:
Music plays
ROSALINE:
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
FERDINAND:
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
ROSALINE:
You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
FERDINAND:
Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
FERDINAND:
The music plays, vouchsafe some motion to it.
ROSALINE:
Our ears vouchsafe it.
FERDINAND:
But your legs should do it.
ROSALINE:
Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
ROSALINE:
We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.
FERDINAND:
Why take we hands, then?
ROSALINE:
Only to part friends
ROSALINE:
Curtsy, sweet hearts, and so the measure ends.
FERDINAND:
More measure of this measure, be not nice.
ROSALINE:
We can afford no more at such a price.
FERDINAND:
Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
ROSALINE:
Your absence only.
FERDINAND:
That can never be.
ROSALINE:
Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu,
ROSALINE:
Twice to your visor, and half once to you.
FERDINAND:
If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
ROSALINE:
In private, then.
FERDINAND:
I am best pleased with that.
FERDINAND:
They converse apart
BIRON:
White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
PRINCESS:
Honey, and milk, and sugar, there is three.
BIRON:
Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
BIRON:
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
BIRON:
There's half-a-dozen sweets.
PRINCESS:
Seventh sweet, adieu
PRINCESS:
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.
BIRON:
One word in secret.
PRINCESS:
Let it not be sweet.
BIRON:
Thou grievest my gall.
PRINCESS:
Gall! bitter.
BIRON:
Therefore meet.
BIRON:
They converse apart
DUMAIN:
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
MARIA:
Name it.
DUMAIN:
Fair lady,--
MARIA:
Say you so? Fair lord,--
MARIA:
Take that for your fair lady.
DUMAIN:
Please it you,
DUMAIN:
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
DUMAIN:
They converse apart
KATHARINE:
What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
LONGAVILLE:
I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
KATHARINE:
O for your reason! quickly, sir, I long.
LONGAVILLE:
You have a double tongue within your mask,
LONGAVILLE:
And would afford my speechless vizard half.
KATHARINE:
Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
LONGAVILLE:
A calf, fair lady!
KATHARINE:
No, a fair lord calf.
LONGAVILLE:
Let's part the word.
KATHARINE:
No, I'll not be your half
KATHARINE:
Take all, and wean it, it may prove an ox.
LONGAVILLE:
Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
LONGAVILLE:
Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.
KATHARINE:
Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
LONGAVILLE:
One word in private with you, ere I die.
KATHARINE:
Bleat softly then, the butcher hears you cry.
KATHARINE:
They converse apart
BOYET:
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
BOYET:
As is the razor's edge invisible,
BOYET:
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
BOYET:
Above the sense of sense, so sensible
BOYET:
Seemeth their conference, their conceits have wings
BOYET:
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.
ROSALINE:
Not one word more, my maids, break off, break off.
BIRON:
By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
FERDINAND:
Farewell, mad wenches, you have simple wits.
PRINCESS:
Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
PRINCESS:
Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors
PRINCESS:
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?
BOYET:
Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
ROSALINE:
Well-liking wits they have, gross, gross, fat, fat.
PRINCESS:
O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
PRINCESS:
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
PRINCESS:
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
PRINCESS:
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
ROSALINE:
O, they were all in lamentable cases!
ROSALINE:
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
PRINCESS:
Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
MARIA:
Dumain was at my service, and his sword
MARIA:
No point, quoth I, my servant straight was mute.
KATHARINE:
Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart,
KATHARINE:
And trow you what he called me?
PRINCESS:
Qualm, perhaps.
KATHARINE:
Yes, in good faith.
PRINCESS:
Go, sickness as thou art!
ROSALINE:
Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
ROSALINE:
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
PRINCESS:
And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.
KATHARINE:
And Longaville was for my service born.
MARIA:
Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
BOYET:
Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear
BOYET:
Immediately they will again be here
BOYET:
In their own shapes, for it can never be
BOYET:
They will digest this harsh indignity.
PRINCESS:
Will they return?
BOYET:
They will, they will, God knows,
BOYET:
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows
BOYET:
Therefore change favours, and, when they repair,
BOYET:
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.
PRINCESS:
How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
BOYET:
Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud,
BOYET:
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
BOYET:
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.
PRINCESS:
Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
PRINCESS:
If they return in their own shapes to woo?
ROSALINE:
Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
ROSALINE:
Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised
ROSALINE:
Let us complain to them what fools were here,
ROSALINE:
Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear,
ROSALINE:
And wonder what they were and to what end
ROSALINE:
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
ROSALINE:
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
ROSALINE:
Should be presented at our tent to us.
BOYET:
Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
PRINCESS:
Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
PRINCESS:
Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA
PRINCESS:
Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper habits
FERDINAND:
Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?
BOYET:
Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
BOYET:
Command me any service to her thither?
FERDINAND:
That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
BOYET:
I will, and so will she, I know, my lord.
BOYET:
Exit
BIRON:
This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
BIRON:
And utters it again when God doth please
BIRON:
He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
BIRON:
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs,
BIRON:
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
BIRON:
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
BIRON:
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve,
BIRON:
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve,
BIRON:
A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
BIRON:
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy,
BIRON:
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
BIRON:
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
BIRON:
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
BIRON:
A mean most meanly, and in ushering
BIRON:
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet,
BIRON:
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet
BIRON:
This is the flower that smiles on every one,
BIRON:
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone,
BIRON:
And consciences, that will not die in debt,
BIRON:
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.
FERDINAND:
A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
FERDINAND:
That put Armado's page out of his part!
BIRON:
See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
BIRON:
Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?
BIRON:
Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE
FERDINAND:
All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
PRINCESS:
'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
FERDINAND:
Construe my speeches better, if you may.
PRINCESS:
Then wish me better, I will give you leave.
FERDINAND:
We came to visit you, and purpose now
FERDINAND:
To lead you to our court, vouchsafe it then.
PRINCESS:
This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow
PRINCESS:
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
FERDINAND:
Rebuke me not for that which you provoke
FERDINAND:
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
PRINCESS:
You nickname virtue, vice you should have spoke,
PRINCESS:
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
PRINCESS:
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
PRINCESS:
As the unsullied lily, I protest,
PRINCESS:
A world of torments though I should endure,
PRINCESS:
I would not yield to be your house's guest,
PRINCESS:
So much I hate a breaking cause to be
PRINCESS:
Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.
FERDINAND:
O, you have lived in desolation here,
FERDINAND:
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
PRINCESS:
Not so, my lord, it is not so, I swear,
PRINCESS:
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game
PRINCESS:
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
FERDINAND:
How, madam! Russians!
PRINCESS:
Ay, in truth, my lord,
PRINCESS:
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
ROSALINE:
Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord
ROSALINE:
My lady, to the manner of the days,
ROSALINE:
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
ROSALINE:
We four indeed confronted were with four
ROSALINE:
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
ROSALINE:
And talk'd apace, and in that hour, my lord,
ROSALINE:
They did not bless us with one happy word.
ROSALINE:
I dare not call them fools, but this I think,
ROSALINE:
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
BIRON:
This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
BIRON:
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
BIRON:
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
BIRON:
By light we lose light: your capacity
BIRON:
Is of that nature that to your huge store
BIRON:
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
ROSALINE:
This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--
BIRON:
I am a fool, and full of poverty.
ROSALINE:
But that you take what doth to you belong,
ROSALINE:
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
BIRON:
O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
ROSALINE:
All the fool mine?
BIRON:
I cannot give you less.
ROSALINE:
Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
BIRON:
Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
ROSALINE:
There, then, that vizard, that superfluous case
ROSALINE:
That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
FERDINAND:
We are descried, they'll mock us now downright.
DUMAIN:
Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
PRINCESS:
Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
ROSALINE:
Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
ROSALINE:
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
BIRON:
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
BIRON:
Can any face of brass hold longer out?
BIRON:
lady, dart thy skill at me,
BIRON:
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout,
BIRON:
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,
BIRON:
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit,
BIRON:
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
BIRON:
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
BIRON:
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
BIRON:
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
BIRON:
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
BIRON:
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
BIRON:
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
BIRON:
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
BIRON:
Figures pedantical, these summer-flies
BIRON:
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation
BIRON:
I do forswear them, and I here protest,
BIRON:
By this white glove,--how white the hand, God knows!--
BIRON:
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
BIRON:
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes
BIRON:
And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
BIRON:
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
ROSALINE:
Sans sans, I pray you.
BIRON:
Yet I have a trick
BIRON:
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick,
BIRON:
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see
BIRON:
Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three,
BIRON:
They are infected, in their hearts it lies,
BIRON:
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes,
BIRON:
These lords are visited, you are not free,
BIRON:
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
PRINCESS:
No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
BIRON:
Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
ROSALINE:
It is not so, for how can this be true,
ROSALINE:
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
BIRON:
Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
ROSALINE:
Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
BIRON:
Speak for yourselves, my wit is at an end.
FERDINAND:
Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
FERDINAND:
Some fair excuse.
PRINCESS:
The fairest is confession.
PRINCESS:
Were not you here but even now disguised?
FERDINAND:
Madam, I was.
PRINCESS:
And were you well advised?
FERDINAND:
I was, fair madam.
PRINCESS:
When you then were here,
PRINCESS:
What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
FERDINAND:
That more than all the world I did respect her.
PRINCESS:
When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
FERDINAND:
Upon mine honour, no.
PRINCESS:
Peace, peace! forbear
PRINCESS:
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
FERDINAND:
Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
PRINCESS:
I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
PRINCESS:
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
ROSALINE:
Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
ROSALINE:
As precious eyesight, and did value me
ROSALINE:
Above this world, adding thereto moreover
ROSALINE:
That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
PRINCESS:
God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
PRINCESS:
Most honourably doth unhold his word.
FERDINAND:
What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
FERDINAND:
I never swore this lady such an oath.
ROSALINE:
By heaven, you did, and to confirm it plain,
ROSALINE:
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
FERDINAND:
My faith and this the princess I did give
FERDINAND:
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
PRINCESS:
Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear,
PRINCESS:
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
PRINCESS:
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
BIRON:
Neither of either, I remit both twain.
BIRON:
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
BIRON:
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
BIRON:
To dash it like a Christmas comedy
BIRON:
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
BIRON:
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
BIRON:
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
BIRON:
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
BIRON:
Told our intents before, which once disclosed,
BIRON:
The ladies did change favours: and then we,
BIRON:
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
BIRON:
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
BIRON:
We are again forsworn, in will and error.
BIRON:
Much upon this it is: and might not you
BIRON:
To BOYET
BIRON:
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
BIRON:
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
BIRON:
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
BIRON:
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
BIRON:
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
BIRON:
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd,
BIRON:
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
BIRON:
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
BIRON:
Wounds like a leaden sword.
BOYET:
Full merrily
BOYET:
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
BIRON:
Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
BIRON:
Enter COSTARD
BIRON:
Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.
COSTARD:
O Lord, sir, they would know
COSTARD:
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
BIRON:
What, are there but three?
COSTARD:
No, sir, but it is vara fine,
COSTARD:
For every one pursents three.
BIRON:
And three times thrice is nine.
COSTARD:
Not so, sir, under correction, sir, I hope it is not so.
COSTARD:
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
COSTARD:
what we know
COSTARD:
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--
BIRON:
Is not nine.
COSTARD:
Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
BIRON:
By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
COSTARD:
O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
COSTARD:
by reckoning, sir.
BIRON:
How much is it?
COSTARD:
O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
COSTARD:
sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
COSTARD:
own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
COSTARD:
in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
BIRON:
Art thou one of the Worthies?
COSTARD:
It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
COSTARD:
Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
COSTARD:
the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
BIRON:
Go, bid them prepare.
COSTARD:
We will turn it finely off, sir, we will take
COSTARD:
some care.
COSTARD:
Exit
FERDINAND:
Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.
BIRON:
We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
BIRON:
To have one show worse than the king's and his company.
FERDINAND:
I say they shall not come.
PRINCESS:
Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now
PRINCESS:
That sport best pleases that doth least know how
PRINCESS:
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
PRINCESS:
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents
PRINCESS:
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
PRINCESS:
When great things labouring perish in their birth.
BIRON:
A right description of our sport, my lord.
BIRON:
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
BIRON:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Converses apart with FERDINAND, and delivers him a paper
PRINCESS:
Doth this man serve God?
BIRON:
Why ask you?
PRINCESS:
He speaks not like a man of God's making.
PRINCESS:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch, for,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
fantastical, too, too vain, too too vain: but we
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Exit
FERDINAND:
Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
FERDINAND:
presents Hector of Troy, the swain, Pompey the
FERDINAND:
Great, the parish curate, Alexander, Armado's page,
FERDINAND:
Hercules, the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
FERDINAND:
these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
FERDINAND:
These four will change habits, and present the other five.
BIRON:
There is five in the first show.
FERDINAND:
You are deceived, 'tis not so.
BIRON:
The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
BIRON:
and the boy:--
BIRON:
Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
BIRON:
Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.
FERDINAND:
The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
FERDINAND:
Enter COSTARD, for Pompey
COSTARD:
I Pompey am,--
BOYET:
You lie, you are not he.
COSTARD:
I Pompey am,--
BOYET:
With libbard's head on knee.
BIRON:
Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
BIRON:
with thee.
COSTARD:
I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--
DUMAIN:
The Great.
COSTARD:
It is, 'Great,' sir:--
COSTARD:
Pompey surnamed the Great,
COSTARD:
That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
COSTARD:
my foe to sweat
COSTARD:
And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
COSTARD:
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
COSTARD:
If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.
PRINCESS:
Great thanks, great Pompey.
COSTARD:
'Tis not so much worth, but I hope I was perfect: I
COSTARD:
made a little fault in 'Great.'
BIRON:
My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
BIRON:
Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander
SIR NATHANIEL:
When in the world I lived, I was the world's
SIR NATHANIEL:
commander,
SIR NATHANIEL:
By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
SIR NATHANIEL:
conquering might
SIR NATHANIEL:
My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--
BOYET:
Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.
BIRON:
Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.
PRINCESS:
The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.
SIR NATHANIEL:
When in the world I lived, I was the world's
SIR NATHANIEL:
commander,--
BOYET:
Most true, 'tis right, you were so, Alisander.
BIRON:
Pompey the Great,--
COSTARD:
Your servant, and Costard.
BIRON:
Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.
COSTARD:
[To SIR NATHANIEL]  O, sir, you have overthrown
COSTARD:
Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of
COSTARD:
the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds
COSTARD:
his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given
COSTARD:
to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,
COSTARD:
and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.
COSTARD:
SIR NATHANIEL retires
COSTARD:
There, an't shall please you, a foolish mild man, an
COSTARD:
honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a
COSTARD:
marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good
COSTARD:
bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how
COSTARD:
'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies
COSTARD:
a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.
COSTARD:
Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas, and MOTH, for Hercules
HOLOFERNES:
Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
HOLOFERNES:
Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis,
HOLOFERNES:
And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
HOLOFERNES:
Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
HOLOFERNES:
Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
HOLOFERNES:
Ergo I come with this apology.
HOLOFERNES:
Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.
HOLOFERNES:
MOTH retires
HOLOFERNES:
Judas I am,--
DUMAIN:
A Judas!
HOLOFERNES:
Not Iscariot, sir.
HOLOFERNES:
Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.
DUMAIN:
Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
BIRON:
A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?
HOLOFERNES:
Judas I am,--
DUMAIN:
The more shame for you, Judas.
HOLOFERNES:
What mean you, sir?
BOYET:
To make Judas hang himself.
HOLOFERNES:
Begin, sir, you are my elder.
BIRON:
Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
HOLOFERNES:
I will not be put out of countenance.
BIRON:
Because thou hast no face.
HOLOFERNES:
What is this?
BOYET:
A cittern-head.
DUMAIN:
The head of a bodkin.
BIRON:
A Death's face in a ring.
LONGAVILLE:
The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.
BOYET:
The pommel of Caesar's falchion.
DUMAIN:
The carved-bone face on a flask.
BIRON:
Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.
DUMAIN:
Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
BIRON:
Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
BIRON:
And now forward, for we have put thee in countenance.
HOLOFERNES:
You have put me out of countenance.
BIRON:
False, we have given thee faces.
HOLOFERNES:
But you have out-faced them all.
BIRON:
An thou wert a lion, we would do so.
BOYET:
Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
BOYET:
And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?
DUMAIN:
For the latter end of his name.
BIRON:
For the ass to the Jude, give it him:--Jud-as, away!
HOLOFERNES:
This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
BOYET:
A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.
BOYET:
HOLOFERNES retires
PRINCESS:
Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
PRINCESS:
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector
BIRON:
Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.
DUMAIN:
Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
FERDINAND:
Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
BOYET:
But is this Hector?
FERDINAND:
I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.
LONGAVILLE:
His leg is too big for Hector's.
DUMAIN:
More calf, certain.
BOYET:
No, he is best endued in the small.
BIRON:
This cannot be Hector.
DUMAIN:
He's a god or a painter, for he makes faces.
DUMAIN:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Gave Hector a gift,--
DUMAIN:
A gilt nutmeg.
BIRON:
A lemon.
LONGAVILLE:
Stuck with cloves.
DUMAIN:
No, cloven.
DUMAIN:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Peace!--
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
A man so breathed, that certain he would fight, yea
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I am that flower,--
DUMAIN:
That mint.
LONGAVILLE:
That columbine.
LONGAVILLE:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
LONGAVILLE:
I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.
DUMAIN:
Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
DUMAIN:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The sweet war-man is dead and rotten, sweet chucks,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
To the PRINCESS
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.
PRINCESS:
Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
PRINCESS:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.
BOYET:
[Aside to DUMAIN]  Loves her by the foot,--
DUMAIN:
[Aside to BOYET]  He may not by the yard.
DUMAIN:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--
COSTARD:
The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone, she
COSTARD:
is two months on her way.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
What meanest thou?
COSTARD:
Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
COSTARD:
wench is cast away: she's quick, the child brags in
COSTARD:
her belly already: tis yours.
COSTARD:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
die.
COSTARD:
Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
COSTARD:
quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
COSTARD:
him.
DUMAIN:
Most rare Pompey!
BOYET:
Renowned Pompey!
BIRON:
Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
BIRON:
Pompey the Huge!
DUMAIN:
Hector trembles.
BIRON:
Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
BIRON:
on! stir them on!
DUMAIN:
Hector will challenge him.
BIRON:
Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
BIRON:
sup a flea.
BIRON:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
By the north pole, I do challenge thee.
COSTARD:
I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man
COSTARD:
I'll slash, I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
COSTARD:
let me borrow my arms again.
DUMAIN:
Room for the incensed Worthies!
COSTARD:
I'll do it in my shirt.
DUMAIN:
Most resolute Pompey!
MOTH:
Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
MOTH:
not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
MOTH:
you? You will lose your reputation.
MOTH:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me, I will not combat
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
in my shirt.
DUMAIN:
You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
DUMAIN:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
BIRON:
What reason have you for't?
BIRON:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt, I go
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
woolward for penance.
BOYET:
True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
BOYET:
linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
BOYET:
a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
BOYET:
his heart for a favour.
BOYET:
Enter MERCADE
MERCADE:
God save you, madam!
PRINCESS:
Welcome, Mercade,
PRINCESS:
But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
MERCADE:
I am sorry, madam, for the news I bring
MERCADE:
Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--
PRINCESS:
Dead, for my life!
MERCADE:
Even so, my tale is told.
BIRON:
Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
BIRON:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Exeunt Worthies
FERDINAND:
How fares your majesty?
PRINCESS:
Boyet, prepare, I will away tonight.
FERDINAND:
Madam, not so, I do beseech you, stay.
PRINCESS:
Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
PRINCESS:
For all your fair endeavors, and entreat,
PRINCESS:
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
PRINCESS:
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
PRINCESS:
The liberal opposition of our spirits,
PRINCESS:
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
PRINCESS:
In the converse of breath: your gentleness
PRINCESS:
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
PRINCESS:
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
PRINCESS:
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
PRINCESS:
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
FERDINAND:
The extreme parts of time extremely forms
FERDINAND:
All causes to the purpose of his speed,
FERDINAND:
And often at his very loose decides
FERDINAND:
That which long process could not arbitrate
FERDINAND:
And though the mourning brow of progeny
FERDINAND:
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
FERDINAND:
The holy suit which fain it would convince,
FERDINAND:
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
FERDINAND:
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
FERDINAND:
From what it purposed, since, to wail friends lost
FERDINAND:
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
FERDINAND:
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
PRINCESS:
I understand you not: my griefs are double.
BIRON:
Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief,
BIRON:
And by these badges understand the king.
BIRON:
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
BIRON:
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
BIRON:
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
BIRON:
Even to the opposed end of our intents
BIRON:
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
BIRON:
As love is full of unbefitting strains,
BIRON:
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
BIRON:
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
BIRON:
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
BIRON:
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
BIRON:
To every varied object in his glance
BIRON:
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
BIRON:
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
BIRON:
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
BIRON:
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
BIRON:
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
BIRON:
Our love being yours, the error that love makes
BIRON:
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
BIRON:
By being once false for ever to be true
BIRON:
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you
BIRON:
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
BIRON:
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
PRINCESS:
We have received your letters full of love,
PRINCESS:
Your favours, the ambassadors of love,
PRINCESS:
And, in our maiden council, rated them
PRINCESS:
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
PRINCESS:
As bombast and as lining to the time
PRINCESS:
But more devout than this in our respects
PRINCESS:
Have we not been, and therefore met your loves
PRINCESS:
In their own fashion, like a merriment.
DUMAIN:
Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
LONGAVILLE:
So did our looks.
ROSALINE:
We did not quote them so.
FERDINAND:
Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
FERDINAND:
Grant us your loves.
PRINCESS:
A time, methinks, too short
PRINCESS:
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
PRINCESS:
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
PRINCESS:
Full of dear guiltiness, and therefore this
PRINCESS:
If for my love, as there is no such cause,
PRINCESS:
You will do aught, this shall you do for me
PRINCESS:
Your oath I will not trust, but go with speed
PRINCESS:
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
PRINCESS:
Remote from all the pleasures of the world,
PRINCESS:
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
PRINCESS:
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
PRINCESS:
If this austere insociable life
PRINCESS:
Change not your offer made in heat of blood,
PRINCESS:
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
PRINCESS:
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
PRINCESS:
But that it bear this trial and last love,
PRINCESS:
Then, at the expiration of the year,
PRINCESS:
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
PRINCESS:
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
PRINCESS:
I will be thine, and till that instant shut
PRINCESS:
My woeful self up in a mourning house,
PRINCESS:
Raining the tears of lamentation
PRINCESS:
For the remembrance of my father's death.
PRINCESS:
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
PRINCESS:
Neither entitled in the other's heart.
FERDINAND:
If this, or more than this, I would deny,
FERDINAND:
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
FERDINAND:
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
FERDINAND:
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
DUMAIN:
But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?
KATHARINE:
A beard, fair health, and honesty,
KATHARINE:
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
DUMAIN:
O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
KATHARINE:
Not so, my lord, a twelvemonth and a day
KATHARINE:
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say
KATHARINE:
Come when the king doth to my lady come,
KATHARINE:
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
DUMAIN:
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
KATHARINE:
Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
LONGAVILLE:
What says Maria?
MARIA:
At the twelvemonth's end
MARIA:
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
LONGAVILLE:
I'll stay with patience, but the time is long.
MARIA:
The liker you, few taller are so young.
BIRON:
Studies my lady? mistress, look on me,
BIRON:
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
BIRON:
What humble suit attends thy answer there
BIRON:
Impose some service on me for thy love.
ROSALINE:
Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
ROSALINE:
Before I saw you, and the world's large tongue
ROSALINE:
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
ROSALINE:
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
ROSALINE:
Which you on all estates will execute
ROSALINE:
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
ROSALINE:
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
ROSALINE:
And therewithal to win me, if you please,
ROSALINE:
Without the which I am not to be won,
ROSALINE:
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
ROSALINE:
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
ROSALINE:
With groaning wretches, and your task shall be,
ROSALINE:
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
ROSALINE:
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
BIRON:
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
BIRON:
It cannot be, it is impossible
BIRON:
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
ROSALINE:
Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
ROSALINE:
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
ROSALINE:
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
ROSALINE:
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
ROSALINE:
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
ROSALINE:
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
ROSALINE:
Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
ROSALINE:
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
ROSALINE:
And I will have you and that fault withal,
ROSALINE:
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
ROSALINE:
And I shall find you empty of that fault,
ROSALINE:
Right joyful of your reformation.
BIRON:
A twelvemonth! well, befall what will befall,
BIRON:
I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
PRINCESS:
[To FERDINAND]  Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave.
FERDINAND:
No, madam, we will bring you on your way.
BIRON:
Our wooing doth not end like an old play,
BIRON:
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
BIRON:
Might well have made our sport a comedy.
FERDINAND:
Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
FERDINAND:
And then 'twill end.
BIRON:
That's too long for a play.
BIRON:
Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
BIRON:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--
PRINCESS:
Was not that Hector?
DUMAIN:
The worthy knight of Troy.
DUMAIN:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
a votary, I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
end of our show.
FERDINAND:
Call them forth quickly, we will do so.
FERDINAND:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Holla! approach.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD, and others
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
cuckoo. Ver, begin.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
THE SONG
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
SPRING.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
When daisies pied and violets blue
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And lady-smocks all silver-white
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Do paint the meadows with delight,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Mocks married men, for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Unpleasing to a married ear!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And maidens bleach their summer smocks
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Mocks married men, for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Unpleasing to a married ear!
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
WINTER.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
When icicles hang by the wall
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And Tom bears logs into the hall
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And milk comes frozen home in pail,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Tu-who, a merry note,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
When all aloud the wind doth blow
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And coughing drowns the parson's saw
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And birds sit brooding in the snow
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Tu-who, a merry note,
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Apollo. You that way: we this way.
