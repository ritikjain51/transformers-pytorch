AUFIDIUS:
ACT I
AUFIDIUS:
SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.
AUFIDIUS:
Enter two Gentlemen
First Gentleman:
You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
First Gentleman:
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
First Gentleman:
Still seem as does the king.
Second Gentleman:
But what's the matter?
First Gentleman:
His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
First Gentleman:
He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
First Gentleman:
That late he married--hath referr'd herself
First Gentleman:
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded,
First Gentleman:
Her husband banish'd, she imprison'd: all
First Gentleman:
Is outward sorrow, though I think the king
First Gentleman:
Be touch'd at very heart.
Second Gentleman:
None but the king?
First Gentleman:
He that hath lost her too, so is the queen,
First Gentleman:
That most desired the match, but not a courtier,
First Gentleman:
Although they wear their faces to the bent
First Gentleman:
Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
First Gentleman:
Glad at the thing they scowl at.
Second Gentleman:
And why so?
First Gentleman:
He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
First Gentleman:
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
First Gentleman:
I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
First Gentleman:
And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
First Gentleman:
As, to seek through the regions of the earth
First Gentleman:
For one his like, there would be something failing
First Gentleman:
In him that should compare. I do not think
First Gentleman:
So fair an outward and such stuff within
First Gentleman:
Endows a man but he.
Second Gentleman:
You speak him far.
First Gentleman:
I do extend him, sir, within himself,
First Gentleman:
Crush him together rather than unfold
First Gentleman:
His measure duly.
Second Gentleman:
What's his name and birth?
First Gentleman:
I cannot delve him to the root: his father
First Gentleman:
Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
First Gentleman:
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
First Gentleman:
But had his titles by Tenantius whom
First Gentleman:
He served with glory and admired success,
First Gentleman:
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus,
First Gentleman:
And had, besides this gentleman in question,
First Gentleman:
Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
First Gentleman:
Died with their swords in hand, for which
First Gentleman:
their father,
First Gentleman:
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
First Gentleman:
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
First Gentleman:
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
First Gentleman:
As he was born. The king he takes the babe
First Gentleman:
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
First Gentleman:
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
First Gentleman:
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
First Gentleman:
Could make him the receiver of, which he took,
First Gentleman:
As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
First Gentleman:
And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
First Gentleman:
Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
First Gentleman:
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
First Gentleman:
A glass that feated them, and to the graver
First Gentleman:
A child that guided dotards, to his mistress,
First Gentleman:
For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
First Gentleman:
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue,
First Gentleman:
By her election may be truly read
First Gentleman:
What kind of man he is.
Second Gentleman:
I honour him
Second Gentleman:
Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
Second Gentleman:
Is she sole child to the king?
First Gentleman:
His only child.
First Gentleman:
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
First Gentleman:
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
First Gentleman:
I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
First Gentleman:
Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
First Gentleman:
Which way they went.
Second Gentleman:
How long is this ago?
First Gentleman:
Some twenty years.
Second Gentleman:
That a king's children should be so convey'd,
Second Gentleman:
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
Second Gentleman:
That could not trace them!
First Gentleman:
Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
First Gentleman:
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
First Gentleman:
Yet is it true, sir.
Second Gentleman:
I do well believe you.
First Gentleman:
We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,
First Gentleman:
The queen, and princess.
First Gentleman:
Exeunt
First Gentleman:
Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN
QUEEN:
No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
QUEEN:
After the slander of most stepmothers,
QUEEN:
Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but
QUEEN:
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
QUEEN:
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
QUEEN:
So soon as I can win the offended king,
QUEEN:
I will be known your advocate: marry, yet
QUEEN:
The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
QUEEN:
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
QUEEN:
Your wisdom may inform you.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Please your highness,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I will from hence to-day.
QUEEN:
You know the peril.
QUEEN:
I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
QUEEN:
The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
QUEEN:
Hath charged you should not speak together.
QUEEN:
Exit
IMOGEN:
O
IMOGEN:
Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
IMOGEN:
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
IMOGEN:
I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing--
IMOGEN:
Always reserved my holy duty--what
IMOGEN:
His rage can do on me: you must be gone,
IMOGEN:
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
IMOGEN:
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
IMOGEN:
But that there is this jewel in the world
IMOGEN:
That I may see again.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
My queen! my mistress!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To be suspected of more tenderness
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Than doth become a man. I will remain
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Who to my father was a friend, to me
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Though ink be made of gall.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Re-enter QUEEN
QUEEN:
Be brief, I pray you
QUEEN:
If the king come, I shall incur I know not
QUEEN:
How much of his displeasure.
QUEEN:
Aside
QUEEN:
Yet I'll move him
QUEEN:
To walk this way: I never do him wrong,
QUEEN:
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends,
QUEEN:
Pays dear for my offences.
QUEEN:
Exit
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Should we be taking leave
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
As long a term as yet we have to live,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
IMOGEN:
Nay, stay a little
IMOGEN:
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
IMOGEN:
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love,
IMOGEN:
This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart,
IMOGEN:
But keep it till you woo another wife,
IMOGEN:
When Imogen is dead.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
How, how! another?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And sear up my embracements from a next
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
With bonds of death!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Putting on the ring
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Remain, remain thou here
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
As I my poor self did exchange for you,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I still win of you: for my sake wear this,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
It is a manacle of love, I'll place it
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Upon this fairest prisoner.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Putting a bracelet upon her arm
IMOGEN:
O the gods!
IMOGEN:
When shall we see again?
IMOGEN:
Enter CYMBELINE and Lords
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Alack, the king!
CYMBELINE:
Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!
CYMBELINE:
If after this command thou fraught the court
CYMBELINE:
With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!
CYMBELINE:
Thou'rt poison to my blood.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The gods protect you!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Exit
IMOGEN:
There cannot be a pinch in death
IMOGEN:
More sharp than this is.
CYMBELINE:
O disloyal thing,
CYMBELINE:
That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
CYMBELINE:
A year's age on me.
IMOGEN:
I beseech you, sir,
IMOGEN:
Harm not yourself with your vexation
IMOGEN:
I am senseless of your wrath, a touch more rare
IMOGEN:
Subdues all pangs, all fears.
CYMBELINE:
Past grace? obedience?
IMOGEN:
Past hope, and in despair, that way, past grace.
CYMBELINE:
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
IMOGEN:
O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
IMOGEN:
And did avoid a puttock.
CYMBELINE:
Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne
CYMBELINE:
A seat for baseness.
IMOGEN:
No, I rather added
IMOGEN:
A lustre to it.
CYMBELINE:
O thou vile one!
IMOGEN:
Sir,
IMOGEN:
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus
IMOGEN:
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
IMOGEN:
A man worth any woman, overbuys me
IMOGEN:
Almost the sum he pays.
CYMBELINE:
What, art thou mad?
IMOGEN:
Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
IMOGEN:
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
IMOGEN:
Our neighbour shepherd's son!
CYMBELINE:
Thou foolish thing!
CYMBELINE:
Re-enter QUEEN
CYMBELINE:
They were again together: you have done
CYMBELINE:
Not after our command. Away with her,
CYMBELINE:
And pen her up.
QUEEN:
Beseech your patience. Peace,
QUEEN:
Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
QUEEN:
Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort
QUEEN:
Out of your best advice.
CYMBELINE:
Nay, let her languish
CYMBELINE:
A drop of blood a day, and, being aged,
CYMBELINE:
Die of this folly!
CYMBELINE:
Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords
QUEEN:
Fie! you must give way.
QUEEN:
Enter PISANIO
QUEEN:
Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
PISANIO:
My lord your son drew on my master.
QUEEN:
Ha!
QUEEN:
No harm, I trust, is done?
PISANIO:
There might have been,
PISANIO:
But that my master rather play'd than fought
PISANIO:
And had no help of anger: they were parted
PISANIO:
By gentlemen at hand.
QUEEN:
I am very glad on't.
IMOGEN:
Your son's my father's friend, he takes his part.
IMOGEN:
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
IMOGEN:
I would they were in Afric both together,
IMOGEN:
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
IMOGEN:
The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
PISANIO:
On his command: he would not suffer me
PISANIO:
To bring him to the haven, left these notes
PISANIO:
Of what commands I should be subject to,
PISANIO:
When 't pleased you to employ me.
QUEEN:
This hath been
QUEEN:
Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
QUEEN:
He will remain so.
PISANIO:
I humbly thank your highness.
QUEEN:
Pray, walk awhile.
IMOGEN:
About some half-hour hence,
IMOGEN:
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
IMOGEN:
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
IMOGEN:
Exeunt
IMOGEN:
SCENE II. The same. A public place.
IMOGEN:
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
First Lord:
Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt, the
First Lord:
violence of action hath made you reek as a
First Lord:
sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in
First Lord:
there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
CLOTEN:
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
Second Lord:
[Aside]  No, 'faith, not so much as his patience.
First Lord:
Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
First Lord:
not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.
Second Lord:
[Aside]  His steel was in debt, it went o' the
Second Lord:
backside the town.
CLOTEN:
The villain would not stand me.
Second Lord:
[Aside]  No, but he fled forward still, toward your face.
First Lord:
Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
First Lord:
he added to your having, gave you some ground.
Second Lord:
[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
CLOTEN:
I would they had not come between us.
Second Lord:
[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how long
Second Lord:
a fool you were upon the ground.
CLOTEN:
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
Second Lord:
[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, she
Second Lord:
is damned.
First Lord:
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
First Lord:
go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen
First Lord:
small reflection of her wit.
Second Lord:
[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest the
Second Lord:
reflection should hurt her.
CLOTEN:
Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some
CLOTEN:
hurt done!
Second Lord:
[Aside]  I wish not so, unless it had been the fall
Second Lord:
of an ass, which is no great hurt.
CLOTEN:
You'll go with us?
First Lord:
I'll attend your lordship.
CLOTEN:
Nay, come, let's go together.
Second Lord:
Well, my lord.
Second Lord:
Exeunt
Second Lord:
SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
Second Lord:
Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO
IMOGEN:
I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
IMOGEN:
And question'dst every sail: if he should write
IMOGEN:
And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
IMOGEN:
As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
IMOGEN:
That he spake to thee?
PISANIO:
It was his queen, his queen!
IMOGEN:
Then waved his handkerchief?
PISANIO:
And kiss'd it, madam.
IMOGEN:
Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
IMOGEN:
And that was all?
PISANIO:
No, madam, for so long
PISANIO:
As he could make me with this eye or ear
PISANIO:
Distinguish him from others, he did keep
PISANIO:
The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
PISANIO:
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind
PISANIO:
Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
PISANIO:
How swift his ship.
IMOGEN:
Thou shouldst have made him
IMOGEN:
As little as a crow, or less, ere left
IMOGEN:
To after-eye him.
PISANIO:
Madam, so I did.
IMOGEN:
I would have broke mine eye-strings, crack'd them, but
IMOGEN:
To look upon him, till the diminution
IMOGEN:
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,
IMOGEN:
Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
IMOGEN:
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
IMOGEN:
Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
IMOGEN:
When shall we hear from him?
PISANIO:
Be assured, madam,
PISANIO:
With his next vantage.
IMOGEN:
I did not take my leave of him, but had
IMOGEN:
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
IMOGEN:
How I would think on him at certain hours
IMOGEN:
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
IMOGEN:
The shes of Italy should not betray
IMOGEN:
Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
IMOGEN:
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
IMOGEN:
To encounter me with orisons, for then
IMOGEN:
I am in heaven for him, or ere I could
IMOGEN:
Give him that parting kiss which I had set
IMOGEN:
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
IMOGEN:
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
IMOGEN:
Shakes all our buds from growing.
IMOGEN:
Enter a Lady
Lady:
The queen, madam,
Lady:
Desires your highness' company.
IMOGEN:
Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
IMOGEN:
I will attend the queen.
PISANIO:
Madam, I shall.
PISANIO:
Exeunt
PISANIO:
SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.
PISANIO:
Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard
IACHIMO:
Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was
IACHIMO:
then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy
IACHIMO:
as since he hath been allowed the name of, but I
IACHIMO:
could then have looked on him without the help of
IACHIMO:
admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments
IACHIMO:
had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
PHILARIO:
You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
PHILARIO:
he is with that which makes him both without and within.
Frenchman:
I have seen him in France: we had very many there
Frenchman:
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
IACHIMO:
This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein
IACHIMO:
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,
IACHIMO:
words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
Frenchman:
And then his banishment.
IACHIMO:
Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this
IACHIMO:
lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
IACHIMO:
to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment,
IACHIMO:
which else an easy battery might lay flat, for
IACHIMO:
taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
IACHIMO:
it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
IACHIMO:
acquaintance?
PHILARIO:
His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I
PHILARIO:
have been often bound for no less than my life.
PHILARIO:
Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
PHILARIO:
amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your
PHILARIO:
knowing, to a stranger of his quality.
PHILARIO:
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
PHILARIO:
I beseech you all, be better known to this
PHILARIO:
gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend
PHILARIO:
of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
PHILARIO:
hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.
Frenchman:
Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
Frenchman:
Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I
Frenchman:
did atone my countryman and you, it had been pity
Frenchman:
you should have been put together with so mortal a
Frenchman:
purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
Frenchman:
slight and trivial a nature.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
my every action to be guided by others' experiences
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.
Frenchman:
'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,
Frenchman:
and by such two that would by all likelihood have
Frenchman:
confounded one the other, or have fallen both.
IACHIMO:
Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
Frenchman:
Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,
Frenchman:
which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.
Frenchman:
It was much like an argument that fell out last
Frenchman:
night, where each of us fell in praise of our
Frenchman:
country mistresses, this gentleman at that time
Frenchman:
vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
Frenchman:
affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,
Frenchman:
chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable
Frenchman:
than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
IACHIMO:
That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's
IACHIMO:
opinion by this worn out.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
IACHIMO:
You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
abate her nothing, though I profess myself her
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
adorer, not her friend.
IACHIMO:
As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
IACHIMO:
comparison--had been something too fair and too good
IACHIMO:
for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
IACHIMO:
I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
IACHIMO:
many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
IACHIMO:
excelled many: but I have not seen the most
IACHIMO:
precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
IACHIMO:
What do you esteem it at?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
More than the world enjoys.
IACHIMO:
Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's
IACHIMO:
outprized by a trifle.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
and only the gift of the gods.
IACHIMO:
Which the gods have given you?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Which, by their graces, I will keep.
IACHIMO:
You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,
IACHIMO:
strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
IACHIMO:
ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
IACHIMO:
estimations, the one is but frail and the other
IACHIMO:
casual, a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished
IACHIMO:
courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
nothing doubt you have store of thieves,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
PHILARIO:
Let us leave here, gentlemen.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
thank him, makes no stranger of me, we are familiar at first.
IACHIMO:
With five times so much conversation, I should get
IACHIMO:
ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even
IACHIMO:
to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
No, no.
IACHIMO:
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
IACHIMO:
your ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it
IACHIMO:
something: but I make my wager rather against your
IACHIMO:
confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your
IACHIMO:
offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
IACHIMO:
lady in the world.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
You are a great deal abused in too bold a
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what you're
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
worthy of by your attempt.
IACHIMO:
What's that?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
deserve more, a punishment too.
PHILARIO:
Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly,
PHILARIO:
let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be
PHILARIO:
better acquainted.
IACHIMO:
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
IACHIMO:
approbation of what I have spoke!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
What lady would you choose to assail?
IACHIMO:
Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
IACHIMO:
I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,
IACHIMO:
that, commend me to the court where your lady is,
IACHIMO:
with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
IACHIMO:
second conference, and I will bring from thence
IACHIMO:
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I hold dear as my finger, 'tis part of it.
IACHIMO:
You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy
IACHIMO:
ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
IACHIMO:
preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
IACHIMO:
religion in you, that you fear.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
This is but a custom in your tongue, you bear a
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
graver purpose, I hope.
IACHIMO:
I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo
IACHIMO:
what's spoken, I swear.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.
PHILARIO:
I will have it no lay.
IACHIMO:
By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no
IACHIMO:
sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
IACHIMO:
bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
IACHIMO:
are yours, so is your diamond too: if I come off,
IACHIMO:
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,
IACHIMO:
she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
IACHIMO:
yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
IACHIMO:
free entertainment.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I embrace these conditions, let us have articles
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
to understand you have prevailed, I am no further
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
your enemy, she is not worth our debate: if she
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
remain unseduced, you not making it appear
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
your sword.
IACHIMO:
Your hand, a covenant: we will have these things set
IACHIMO:
down by lawful counsel, and straight away for
IACHIMO:
Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and
IACHIMO:
starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two
IACHIMO:
wagers recorded.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Agreed.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO
Frenchman:
Will this hold, think you?
PHILARIO:
Signior Iachimo will not from it.
PHILARIO:
Pray, let us follow 'em.
PHILARIO:
Exeunt
PHILARIO:
SCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
PHILARIO:
Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS
QUEEN:
Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers,
QUEEN:
Make haste: who has the note of them?
First Lady:
I, madam.
QUEEN:
Dispatch.
QUEEN:
Exeunt Ladies
QUEEN:
Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?
CORNELIUS:
Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam
CORNELIUS:
Presenting a small box
CORNELIUS:
But I beseech your grace, without offence,--
CORNELIUS:
My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
CORNELIUS:
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,
CORNELIUS:
Which are the movers of a languishing death,
CORNELIUS:
But though slow, deadly?
QUEEN:
I wonder, doctor,
QUEEN:
Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
QUEEN:
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
QUEEN:
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
QUEEN:
That our great king himself doth woo me oft
QUEEN:
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--
QUEEN:
Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
QUEEN:
That I did amplify my judgment in
QUEEN:
Other conclusions? I will try the forces
QUEEN:
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
QUEEN:
We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
QUEEN:
To try the vigour of them and apply
QUEEN:
Allayments to their act, and by them gather
QUEEN:
Their several virtues and effects.
CORNELIUS:
Your highness
CORNELIUS:
Shall from this practise but make hard your heart
CORNELIUS:
Besides, the seeing these effects will be
CORNELIUS:
Both noisome and infectious.
QUEEN:
O, content thee.
QUEEN:
Enter PISANIO
QUEEN:
Aside
QUEEN:
Here comes a flattering rascal, upon him
QUEEN:
Will I first work: he's for his master,
QUEEN:
An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!
QUEEN:
Doctor, your service for this time is ended,
QUEEN:
Take your own way.
CORNELIUS:
[Aside]          I do suspect you, madam,
CORNELIUS:
But you shall do no harm.
QUEEN:
[To PISANIO]            Hark thee, a word.
CORNELIUS:
[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she has
CORNELIUS:
Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,
CORNELIUS:
And will not trust one of her malice with
CORNELIUS:
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
CORNELIUS:
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,
CORNELIUS:
Which first, perchance, she'll prove on
CORNELIUS:
cats and dogs,
CORNELIUS:
Then afterward up higher: but there is
CORNELIUS:
No danger in what show of death it makes,
CORNELIUS:
More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
CORNELIUS:
To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
CORNELIUS:
With a most false effect, and I the truer,
CORNELIUS:
So to be false with her.
QUEEN:
No further service, doctor,
QUEEN:
Until I send for thee.
CORNELIUS:
I humbly take my leave.
CORNELIUS:
Exit
QUEEN:
Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
QUEEN:
She will not quench and let instructions enter
QUEEN:
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work
QUEEN:
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
QUEEN:
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
QUEEN:
As great as is thy master, greater, for
QUEEN:
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
QUEEN:
Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor
QUEEN:
Continue where he is: to shift his being
QUEEN:
Is to exchange one misery with another,
QUEEN:
And every day that comes comes to decay
QUEEN:
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
QUEEN:
To be depender on a thing that leans,
QUEEN:
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
QUEEN:
So much as but to prop him?
QUEEN:
The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up
QUEEN:
Thou takest up
QUEEN:
Thou know'st not what, but take it for thy labour
QUEEN:
It is a thing I made, which hath the king
QUEEN:
Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know
QUEEN:
What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it,
QUEEN:
It is an earnest of a further good
QUEEN:
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
QUEEN:
The case stands with her, do't as from thyself.
QUEEN:
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
QUEEN:
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
QUEEN:
Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king
QUEEN:
To any shape of thy preferment such
QUEEN:
As thou'lt desire, and then myself, I chiefly,
QUEEN:
That set thee on to this desert, am bound
QUEEN:
To load thy merit richly. Call my women
QUEEN:
Think on my words.
QUEEN:
Exit PISANIO
QUEEN:
A sly and constant knave,
QUEEN:
Not to be shaked, the agent for his master
QUEEN:
And the remembrancer of her to hold
QUEEN:
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
QUEEN:
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
QUEEN:
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
QUEEN:
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured
QUEEN:
To taste of too.
QUEEN:
Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies
QUEEN:
So, so: well done, well done
QUEEN:
The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
QUEEN:
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio,
QUEEN:
Think on my words.
QUEEN:
Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies
PISANIO:
And shall do
PISANIO:
But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
PISANIO:
I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.
PISANIO:
Exit
PISANIO:
SCENE VI. The same. Another room in the palace.
PISANIO:
Enter IMOGEN
IMOGEN:
A father cruel, and a step-dame false,
IMOGEN:
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
IMOGEN:
That hath her husband banish'd,--O, that husband!
IMOGEN:
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
IMOGEN:
Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
IMOGEN:
As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
IMOGEN:
Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,
IMOGEN:
How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
IMOGEN:
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
IMOGEN:
Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO
PISANIO:
Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
PISANIO:
Comes from my lord with letters.
IACHIMO:
Change you, madam?
IACHIMO:
The worthy Leonatus is in safety
IACHIMO:
And greets your highness dearly.
IACHIMO:
Presents a letter
IMOGEN:
Thanks, good sir
IMOGEN:
You're kindly welcome.
IACHIMO:
[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!
IACHIMO:
If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
IACHIMO:
She is alone the Arabian bird, and I
IACHIMO:
Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
IACHIMO:
Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
IACHIMO:
Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight,
IACHIMO:
Rather directly fly.
IMOGEN:
[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
IMOGEN:
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
IMOGEN:
him accordingly, as you value your trust--
IMOGEN:
LEONATUS.'
IMOGEN:
So far I read aloud
IMOGEN:
But even the very middle of my heart
IMOGEN:
Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
IMOGEN:
You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
IMOGEN:
Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
IMOGEN:
In all that I can do.
IACHIMO:
Thanks, fairest lady.
IACHIMO:
What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
IACHIMO:
To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
IACHIMO:
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
IACHIMO:
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
IACHIMO:
Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
IACHIMO:
Partition make with spectacles so precious
IACHIMO:
'Twixt fair and foul?
IMOGEN:
What makes your admiration?
IACHIMO:
It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys
IACHIMO:
'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
IACHIMO:
Contemn with mows the other, nor i' the judgment,
IACHIMO:
For idiots in this case of favour would
IACHIMO:
Be wisely definite, nor i' the appetite,
IACHIMO:
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
IACHIMO:
Should make desire vomit emptiness,
IACHIMO:
Not so allured to feed.
IMOGEN:
What is the matter, trow?
IACHIMO:
The cloyed will,
IACHIMO:
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
IACHIMO:
Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb
IACHIMO:
Longs after for the garbage.
IMOGEN:
What, dear sir,
IMOGEN:
Thus raps you? Are you well?
IACHIMO:
Thanks, madam, well.
IACHIMO:
To PISANIO
IACHIMO:
Beseech you, sir, desire
IACHIMO:
My man's abode where I did leave him: he
IACHIMO:
Is strange and peevish.
PISANIO:
I was going, sir,
PISANIO:
To give him welcome.
PISANIO:
Exit
IMOGEN:
Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?
IACHIMO:
Well, madam.
IMOGEN:
Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
IACHIMO:
Exceeding pleasant, none a stranger there
IACHIMO:
So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
IACHIMO:
The Briton reveller.
IMOGEN:
When he was here,
IMOGEN:
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
IMOGEN:
Not knowing why.
IACHIMO:
I never saw him sad.
IACHIMO:
There is a Frenchman his companion, one
IACHIMO:
An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
IACHIMO:
A Gallian girl at home, he furnaces
IACHIMO:
The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--
IACHIMO:
Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
IACHIMO:
Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
IACHIMO:
By history, report, or his own proof,
IACHIMO:
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
IACHIMO:
But must be, will his free hours languish for
IACHIMO:
Assured bondage?'
IMOGEN:
Will my lord say so?
IACHIMO:
Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter
IACHIMO:
It is a recreation to be by
IACHIMO:
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,
IACHIMO:
Some men are much to blame.
IMOGEN:
Not he, I hope.
IACHIMO:
Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
IACHIMO:
Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much,
IACHIMO:
In you, which I account his beyond all talents,
IACHIMO:
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
IACHIMO:
To pity too.
IMOGEN:
What do you pity, sir?
IACHIMO:
Two creatures heartily.
IMOGEN:
Am I one, sir?
IMOGEN:
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
IMOGEN:
Deserves your pity?
IACHIMO:
Lamentable! What,
IACHIMO:
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
IACHIMO:
I' the dungeon by a snuff?
IMOGEN:
I pray you, sir,
IMOGEN:
Deliver with more openness your answers
IMOGEN:
To my demands. Why do you pity me?
IACHIMO:
That others do--
IACHIMO:
I was about to say--enjoy your--But
IACHIMO:
It is an office of the gods to venge it,
IACHIMO:
Not mine to speak on 't.
IMOGEN:
You do seem to know
IMOGEN:
Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--
IMOGEN:
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
IMOGEN:
Than to be sure they do, for certainties
IMOGEN:
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
IMOGEN:
The remedy then born--discover to me
IMOGEN:
What both you spur and stop.
IACHIMO:
Had I this cheek
IACHIMO:
To bathe my lips upon, this hand, whose touch,
IACHIMO:
Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
IACHIMO:
To the oath of loyalty, this object, which
IACHIMO:
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
IACHIMO:
Fixing it only here, should I, damn'd then,
IACHIMO:
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
IACHIMO:
That mount the Capitol, join gripes with hands
IACHIMO:
Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as
IACHIMO:
With labour, then by-peeping in an eye
IACHIMO:
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
IACHIMO:
That's fed with stinking tallow, it were fit
IACHIMO:
That all the plagues of hell should at one time
IACHIMO:
Encounter such revolt.
IMOGEN:
My lord, I fear,
IMOGEN:
Has forgot Britain.
IACHIMO:
And himself. Not I,
IACHIMO:
Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
IACHIMO:
The beggary of his change, but 'tis your graces
IACHIMO:
That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
IACHIMO:
Charms this report out.
IMOGEN:
Let me hear no more.
IACHIMO:
O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
IACHIMO:
With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
IACHIMO:
So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
IACHIMO:
Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd
IACHIMO:
With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
IACHIMO:
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
IACHIMO:
That play with all infirmities for gold
IACHIMO:
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
IACHIMO:
As well might poison poison! Be revenged,
IACHIMO:
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
IACHIMO:
Recoil from your great stock.
IMOGEN:
Revenged!
IMOGEN:
How should I be revenged? If this be true,--
IMOGEN:
As I have such a heart that both mine ears
IMOGEN:
Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
IMOGEN:
How should I be revenged?
IACHIMO:
Should he make me
IACHIMO:
Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
IACHIMO:
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
IACHIMO:
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
IACHIMO:
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
IACHIMO:
More noble than that runagate to your bed,
IACHIMO:
And will continue fast to your affection,
IACHIMO:
Still close as sure.
IMOGEN:
What, ho, Pisanio!
IACHIMO:
Let me my service tender on your lips.
IMOGEN:
Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
IMOGEN:
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
IMOGEN:
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
IMOGEN:
For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
IMOGEN:
Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
IMOGEN:
From thy report as thou from honour, and
IMOGEN:
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
IMOGEN:
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
IMOGEN:
The king my father shall be made acquainted
IMOGEN:
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
IMOGEN:
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
IMOGEN:
As in a Romish stew and to expound
IMOGEN:
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
IMOGEN:
He little cares for and a daughter who
IMOGEN:
He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!
IACHIMO:
O happy Leonatus! I may say
IACHIMO:
The credit that thy lady hath of thee
IACHIMO:
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
IACHIMO:
Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
IACHIMO:
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
IACHIMO:
Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
IACHIMO:
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
IACHIMO:
I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
IACHIMO:
Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord,
IACHIMO:
That which he is, new o'er: and he is one
IACHIMO:
The truest manner'd, such a holy witch
IACHIMO:
That he enchants societies into him,
IACHIMO:
Half all men's hearts are his.
IMOGEN:
You make amends.
IACHIMO:
He sits 'mongst men like a descended god
IACHIMO:
He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
IACHIMO:
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
IACHIMO:
Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
IACHIMO:
To try your taking a false report, which hath
IACHIMO:
Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
IACHIMO:
In the election of a sir so rare,
IACHIMO:
Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him
IACHIMO:
Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
IACHIMO:
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.
IMOGEN:
All's well, sir: take my power i' the court
IMOGEN:
for yours.
IACHIMO:
My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
IACHIMO:
To entreat your grace but in a small request,
IACHIMO:
And yet of moment to, for it concerns
IACHIMO:
Your lord, myself and other noble friends,
IACHIMO:
Are partners in the business.
IMOGEN:
Pray, what is't?
IACHIMO:
Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
IACHIMO:
The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
IACHIMO:
To buy a present for the emperor
IACHIMO:
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
IACHIMO:
In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels
IACHIMO:
Of rich and exquisite form, their values great,
IACHIMO:
And I am something curious, being strange,
IACHIMO:
To have them in safe stowage: may it please you
IACHIMO:
To take them in protection?
IMOGEN:
Willingly,
IMOGEN:
And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
IMOGEN:
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
IMOGEN:
In my bedchamber.
IACHIMO:
They are in a trunk,
IACHIMO:
Attended by my men: I will make bold
IACHIMO:
To send them to you, only for this night,
IACHIMO:
I must aboard to-morrow.
IMOGEN:
O, no, no.
IACHIMO:
Yes, I beseech, or I shall short my word
IACHIMO:
By lengthening my return. From Gallia
IACHIMO:
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
IACHIMO:
To see your grace.
IMOGEN:
I thank you for your pains
IMOGEN:
But not away to-morrow!
IACHIMO:
O, I must, madam
IACHIMO:
Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
IACHIMO:
To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night
IACHIMO:
I have outstood my time, which is material
IACHIMO:
To the tender of our present.
IMOGEN:
I will write.
IMOGEN:
Send your trunk to me, it shall safe be kept,
IMOGEN:
And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.
IMOGEN:
Exeunt
IMOGEN:
ACT II
IMOGEN:
SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.
IMOGEN:
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
CLOTEN:
Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the
CLOTEN:
jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a
CLOTEN:
hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes
CLOTEN:
must take me up for swearing, as if I borrowed mine
CLOTEN:
oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
First Lord:
What got he by that? You have broke his pate with
First Lord:
your bowl.
Second Lord:
[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,
Second Lord:
it would have run all out.
CLOTEN:
When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for
CLOTEN:
any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?
Second Lord:
No my lord,
Second Lord:
Aside
Second Lord:
nor crop the ears of them.
CLOTEN:
Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?
CLOTEN:
Would he had been one of my rank!
Second Lord:
[Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.
CLOTEN:
I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a
CLOTEN:
pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am,
CLOTEN:
they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my
CLOTEN:
mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of
CLOTEN:
fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that
CLOTEN:
nobody can match.
Second Lord:
[Aside]  You are cock and capon too, and you crow,
Second Lord:
cock, with your comb on.
CLOTEN:
Sayest thou?
Second Lord:
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
Second Lord:
companion that you give offence to.
CLOTEN:
No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit
CLOTEN:
offence to my inferiors.
Second Lord:
Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
CLOTEN:
Why, so I say.
First Lord:
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
CLOTEN:
A stranger, and I not know on't!
Second Lord:
[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
Second Lord:
not.
First Lord:
There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of
First Lord:
Leonatus' friends.
CLOTEN:
Leonatus! a banished rascal, and he's another,
CLOTEN:
whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
First Lord:
One of your lordship's pages.
CLOTEN:
Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
CLOTEN:
derogation in't?
Second Lord:
You cannot derogate, my lord.
CLOTEN:
Not easily, I think.
Second Lord:
[Aside]  You are a fool granted, therefore your
Second Lord:
issues, being foolish, do not derogate.
CLOTEN:
Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost
CLOTEN:
to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.
Second Lord:
I'll attend your lordship.
Second Lord:
Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord
Second Lord:
That such a crafty devil as is his mother
Second Lord:
Should yield the world this ass! a woman that
Second Lord:
Bears all down with her brain, and this her son
Second Lord:
Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
Second Lord:
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
Second Lord:
Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,
Second Lord:
Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
Second Lord:
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
Second Lord:
More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Second Lord:
Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
Second Lord:
Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm
Second Lord:
The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked
Second Lord:
That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,
Second Lord:
To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!
Second Lord:
Exit
Second Lord:
SCENE II. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace
Second Lord:
a trunk in one corner of it.
Second Lord:
IMOGEN in bed, reading, a Lady attending
IMOGEN:
Who's there? my woman Helen?
Lady:
Please you, madam
IMOGEN:
What hour is it?
Lady:
Almost midnight, madam.
IMOGEN:
I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak
IMOGEN:
Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed
IMOGEN:
Take not away the taper, leave it burning,
IMOGEN:
And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,
IMOGEN:
I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly
IMOGEN:
Exit Lady
IMOGEN:
To your protection I commend me, gods.
IMOGEN:
From fairies and the tempters of the night
IMOGEN:
Guard me, beseech ye.
IMOGEN:
Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk
IACHIMO:
The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense
IACHIMO:
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
IACHIMO:
Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd
IACHIMO:
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
IACHIMO:
How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,
IACHIMO:
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
IACHIMO:
But kiss, one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
IACHIMO:
How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
IACHIMO:
Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper
IACHIMO:
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
IACHIMO:
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
IACHIMO:
Under these windows, white and azure laced
IACHIMO:
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,
IACHIMO:
To note the chamber: I will write all down
IACHIMO:
Such and such pictures, there the window, such
IACHIMO:
The adornment of her bed, the arras, figures,
IACHIMO:
Why, such and such, and the contents o' the story.
IACHIMO:
Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
IACHIMO:
Above ten thousand meaner moveables
IACHIMO:
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
IACHIMO:
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
IACHIMO:
And be her sense but as a monument,
IACHIMO:
Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off
IACHIMO:
Taking off her bracelet
IACHIMO:
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
IACHIMO:
'Tis mine, and this will witness outwardly,
IACHIMO:
As strongly as the conscience does within,
IACHIMO:
To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
IACHIMO:
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
IACHIMO:
I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,
IACHIMO:
Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
IACHIMO:
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
IACHIMO:
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
IACHIMO:
Why should I write this down, that's riveted,
IACHIMO:
Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
IACHIMO:
The tale of Tereus, here the leaf's turn'd down
IACHIMO:
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough
IACHIMO:
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
IACHIMO:
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
IACHIMO:
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear,
IACHIMO:
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.
IACHIMO:
Clock strikes
IACHIMO:
One, two, three: time, time!
IACHIMO:
Goes into the trunk. The scene closes
An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.
Enter CLOTEN and Lords
First Lord:
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the
First Lord:
most coldest that ever turned up ace.
CLOTEN:
It would make any man cold to lose.
First Lord:
But not every man patient after the noble temper of
First Lord:
your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
CLOTEN:
Winning will put any man into courage. If I could
CLOTEN:
get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.
CLOTEN:
It's almost morning, is't not?
First Lord:
Day, my lord.
CLOTEN:
I would this music would come: I am advised to give
CLOTEN:
her music o' mornings, they say it will penetrate.
CLOTEN:
Enter Musicians
CLOTEN:
Come on, tune: if you can penetrate her with your
CLOTEN:
fingering, so, we'll try with tongue too: if none
CLOTEN:
will do, let her remain, but I'll never give o'er.
CLOTEN:
First, a very excellent good-conceited thing,
CLOTEN:
after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich
CLOTEN:
words to it: and then let her consider.
CLOTEN:
SONG
CLOTEN:
Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
CLOTEN:
And Phoebus 'gins arise,
CLOTEN:
His steeds to water at those springs
CLOTEN:
On chaliced flowers that lies,
CLOTEN:
And winking Mary-buds begin
CLOTEN:
To ope their golden eyes
CLOTEN:
With every thing that pretty is,
CLOTEN:
My lady sweet, arise
CLOTEN:
Arise, arise.
CLOTEN:
So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will
CLOTEN:
consider your music the better: if it do not, it is
CLOTEN:
a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and
CLOTEN:
calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
CLOTEN:
boot, can never amend.
CLOTEN:
Exeunt Musicians
Second Lord:
Here comes the king.
CLOTEN:
I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I
CLOTEN:
was up so early: he cannot choose but take this
CLOTEN:
service I have done fatherly.
CLOTEN:
Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN
CLOTEN:
Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.
CYMBELINE:
Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
CYMBELINE:
Will she not forth?
CLOTEN:
I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.
CYMBELINE:
The exile of her minion is too new,
CYMBELINE:
She hath not yet forgot him: some more time
CYMBELINE:
Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
CYMBELINE:
And then she's yours.
QUEEN:
You are most bound to the king,
QUEEN:
Who lets go by no vantages that may
QUEEN:
Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
QUEEN:
To orderly soliciting, and be friended
QUEEN:
With aptness of the season, make denials
QUEEN:
Increase your services, so seem as if
QUEEN:
You were inspired to do those duties which
QUEEN:
You tender to her, that you in all obey her,
QUEEN:
Save when command to your dismission tends,
QUEEN:
And therein you are senseless.
CLOTEN:
Senseless! not so.
CLOTEN:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome,
Messenger:
The one is Caius Lucius.
CYMBELINE:
A worthy fellow,
CYMBELINE:
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now,
CYMBELINE:
But that's no fault of his: we must receive him
CYMBELINE:
According to the honour of his sender,
CYMBELINE:
And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
CYMBELINE:
We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
CYMBELINE:
When you have given good morning to your mistress,
CYMBELINE:
Attend the queen and us, we shall have need
CYMBELINE:
To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.
CYMBELINE:
Exeunt all but CLOTEN
CLOTEN:
If she be up, I'll speak with her, if not,
CLOTEN:
Let her lie still and dream.
CLOTEN:
Knocks
CLOTEN:
By your leave, ho!
CLOTEN:
I Know her women are about her: what
CLOTEN:
If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
CLOTEN:
Which buys admittance, oft it doth, yea, and makes
CLOTEN:
Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
CLOTEN:
Their deer to the stand o' the stealer, and 'tis gold
CLOTEN:
Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief,
CLOTEN:
Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
CLOTEN:
Can it not do and undo? I will make
CLOTEN:
One of her women lawyer to me, for
CLOTEN:
I yet not understand the case myself.
CLOTEN:
Knocks
CLOTEN:
By your leave.
CLOTEN:
Enter a Lady
Lady:
Who's there that knocks?
CLOTEN:
A gentleman.
Lady:
No more?
CLOTEN:
Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.
Lady:
That's more
Lady:
Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
Lady:
Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?
CLOTEN:
Your lady's person: is she ready?
Lady:
Ay,
Lady:
To keep her chamber.
CLOTEN:
There is gold for you,
CLOTEN:
Sell me your good report.
Lady:
How! my good name? or to report of you
Lady:
What I shall think is good?--The princess!
Lady:
Enter IMOGEN
CLOTEN:
Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.
CLOTEN:
Exit Lady
IMOGEN:
Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
IMOGEN:
For purchasing but trouble, the thanks I give
IMOGEN:
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
IMOGEN:
And scarce can spare them.
CLOTEN:
Still, I swear I love you.
IMOGEN:
If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me
IMOGEN:
If you swear still, your recompense is still
IMOGEN:
That I regard it not.
CLOTEN:
This is no answer.
IMOGEN:
But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
IMOGEN:
I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,
IMOGEN:
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
IMOGEN:
To your best kindness: one of your great knowing
IMOGEN:
Should learn, being taught, forbearance.
CLOTEN:
To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin
CLOTEN:
I will not.
IMOGEN:
Fools are not mad folks.
CLOTEN:
Do you call me fool?
IMOGEN:
As I am mad, I do
IMOGEN:
If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad,
IMOGEN:
That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
IMOGEN:
You put me to forget a lady's manners,
IMOGEN:
By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,
IMOGEN:
That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
IMOGEN:
By the very truth of it, I care not for you,
IMOGEN:
And am so near the lack of charity--
IMOGEN:
To accuse myself--I hate you, which I had rather
IMOGEN:
You felt than make't my boast.
CLOTEN:
You sin against
CLOTEN:
Obedience, which you owe your father. For
CLOTEN:
The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
CLOTEN:
One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,
CLOTEN:
With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none
CLOTEN:
And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--
CLOTEN:
Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,
CLOTEN:
On whom there is no more dependency
CLOTEN:
But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot,
CLOTEN:
Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
CLOTEN:
The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil
CLOTEN:
The precious note of it with a base slave.
CLOTEN:
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
CLOTEN:
A pantler, not so eminent.
IMOGEN:
Profane fellow
IMOGEN:
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
IMOGEN:
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
IMOGEN:
To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,
IMOGEN:
Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
IMOGEN:
Comparative for your virtues, to be styled
IMOGEN:
The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
IMOGEN:
For being preferred so well.
CLOTEN:
The south-fog rot him!
IMOGEN:
He never can meet more mischance than come
IMOGEN:
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,
IMOGEN:
That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer
IMOGEN:
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
IMOGEN:
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!
IMOGEN:
Enter PISANIO
CLOTEN:
'His garment!' Now the devil--
IMOGEN:
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--
CLOTEN:
'His garment!'
IMOGEN:
I am sprited with a fool.
IMOGEN:
Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman
IMOGEN:
Search for a jewel that too casually
IMOGEN:
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,
IMOGEN:
If I would lose it for a revenue
IMOGEN:
Of any king's in Europe. I do think
IMOGEN:
I saw't this morning: confident I am
IMOGEN:
Last night 'twas on mine arm, I kiss'd it
IMOGEN:
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
IMOGEN:
That I kiss aught but he.
PISANIO:
'Twill not be lost.
IMOGEN:
I hope so: go and search.
IMOGEN:
Exit PISANIO
CLOTEN:
You have abused me
CLOTEN:
'His meanest garment!'
IMOGEN:
Ay, I said so, sir
IMOGEN:
If you will make't an action, call witness to't.
CLOTEN:
I will inform your father.
IMOGEN:
Your mother too
IMOGEN:
She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
IMOGEN:
But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,
IMOGEN:
To the worst of discontent.
IMOGEN:
Exit
CLOTEN:
I'll be revenged
CLOTEN:
'His meanest garment!' Well.
CLOTEN:
Exit
CLOTEN:
CYMBELINE
CLOTEN:
SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.
CLOTEN:
Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To win the king as I am bold her honour
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Will remain hers.
PHILARIO:
What means do you make to him?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Not any, but abide the change of time,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Quake in the present winter's state and wish
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I barely gratify your love, they failing,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I must die much your debtor.
PHILARIO:
Your very goodness and your company
PHILARIO:
O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
PHILARIO:
Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius
PHILARIO:
Will do's commission throughly: and I think
PHILARIO:
He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
PHILARIO:
Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
PHILARIO:
Is yet fresh in their grief.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I do believe,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That this will prove a war, and you shall hear
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Smiled at their lack of skill, but found
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
their courage
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Now mingled with their courages, will make known
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To their approvers they are people such
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That mend upon the world.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Enter IACHIMO
PHILARIO:
See! Iachimo!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The swiftest harts have posted you by land,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To make your vessel nimble.
PHILARIO:
Welcome, sir.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I hope the briefness of your answer made
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The speediness of your return.
IACHIMO:
Your lady
IACHIMO:
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And therewithal the best, or let her beauty
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Look through a casement to allure false hearts
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And be false with them.
IACHIMO:
Here are letters for you.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Their tenor good, I trust.
IACHIMO:
'Tis very like.
PHILARIO:
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
PHILARIO:
When you were there?
IACHIMO:
He was expected then,
IACHIMO:
But not approach'd.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
All is well yet.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Too dull for your good wearing?
IACHIMO:
If I had lost it,
IACHIMO:
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
IACHIMO:
I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy
IACHIMO:
A second night of such sweet shortness which
IACHIMO:
Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The stone's too hard to come by.
IACHIMO:
Not a whit,
IACHIMO:
Your lady being so easy.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Make not, sir,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Must not continue friends.
IACHIMO:
Good sir, we must,
IACHIMO:
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
IACHIMO:
The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
IACHIMO:
We were to question further: but I now
IACHIMO:
Profess myself the winner of her honour,
IACHIMO:
Together with your ring, and not the wronger
IACHIMO:
Of her or you, having proceeded but
IACHIMO:
By both your wills.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
If you can make't apparent
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And ring is yours, if not, the foul opinion
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
You had of her pure honour gains or loses
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To who shall find them.
IACHIMO:
Sir, my circumstances,
IACHIMO:
Being so near the truth as I will make them,
IACHIMO:
Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
IACHIMO:
I will confirm with oath, which, I doubt not,
IACHIMO:
You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
IACHIMO:
You need it not.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Proceed.
IACHIMO:
First, her bedchamber,--
IACHIMO:
Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess
IACHIMO:
Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd
IACHIMO:
With tapesty of silk and silver, the story
IACHIMO:
Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
IACHIMO:
And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
IACHIMO:
The press of boats or pride: a piece of work
IACHIMO:
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
IACHIMO:
In workmanship and value, which I wonder'd
IACHIMO:
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
IACHIMO:
Since the true life on't was--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
This is true,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And this you might have heard of here, by me,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Or by some other.
IACHIMO:
More particulars
IACHIMO:
Must justify my knowledge.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
So they must,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Or do your honour injury.
IACHIMO:
The chimney
IACHIMO:
Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
IACHIMO:
Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures
IACHIMO:
So likely to report themselves: the cutter
IACHIMO:
Was as another nature, dumb, outwent her,
IACHIMO:
Motion and breath left out.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
This is a thing
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Which you might from relation likewise reap,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Being, as it is, much spoke of.
IACHIMO:
The roof o' the chamber
IACHIMO:
With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--
IACHIMO:
I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
IACHIMO:
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
IACHIMO:
Depending on their brands.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
This is her honour!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Be given to your remembrance--the description
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The wager you have laid.
IACHIMO:
Then, if you can,
IACHIMO:
Showing the bracelet
IACHIMO:
Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel, see!
IACHIMO:
And now 'tis up again: it must be married
IACHIMO:
To that your diamond, I'll keep them.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Jove!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Once more let me behold it: is it that
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Which I left with her?
IACHIMO:
Sir--I thank her--that
IACHIMO:
She stripp'd it from her arm, I see her yet,
IACHIMO:
Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
IACHIMO:
And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said
IACHIMO:
She prized it once.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
May be she pluck'd it off
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To send it me.
IACHIMO:
She writes so to you, doth she?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Gives the ring
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Where there is beauty, truth, where semblance, love,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Where there's another man: the vows of women
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
O, above measure false!
PHILARIO:
Have patience, sir,
PHILARIO:
And take your ring again, 'tis not yet won
PHILARIO:
It may be probable she lost it, or
PHILARIO:
Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,
PHILARIO:
Hath stol'n it from her?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Very true,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Render to me some corporal sign about her,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
More evident than this, for this was stolen.
IACHIMO:
By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Hark you, he swears, by Jupiter he swears.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
She would not lose it: her attendants are
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The cognizance of her incontinency
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
thus dearly.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
There, take thy hire, and all the fiends of hell
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Divide themselves between you!
PHILARIO:
Sir, be patient
PHILARIO:
This is not strong enough to be believed
PHILARIO:
Of one persuaded well of--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Never talk on't,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
She hath been colted by him.
IACHIMO:
If you seek
IACHIMO:
For further satisfying, under her breast--
IACHIMO:
Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud
IACHIMO:
Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,
IACHIMO:
I kiss'd it, and it gave me present hunger
IACHIMO:
To feed again, though full. You do remember
IACHIMO:
This stain upon her?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Ay, and it doth confirm
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Were there no more but it.
IACHIMO:
Will you hear more?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Once, and a million!
IACHIMO:
I'll be sworn--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
No swearing.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
If you will swear you have not done't, you lie,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Thou'st made me cuckold.
IACHIMO:
I'll deny nothing.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I will go there and do't, i' the court, before
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Her father. I'll do something--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Exit
PHILARIO:
Quite besides
PHILARIO:
The government of patience! You have won
PHILARIO:
Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath
PHILARIO:
He hath against himself.
IACHIMO:
With an my heart.
IACHIMO:
Exeunt
IACHIMO:
SCENE V. Another room in Philario's house.
IACHIMO:
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Is there no way for men to be but women
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And that most venerable man which I
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Did call my father, was I know not where
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
When I was stamp'd, some coiner with his tools
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The Dian of that time so doth my wife
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And pray'd me oft forbearance, did it with
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Might well have warm'd old Saturn, that I thought her
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Cried 'O!' and mounted, found no opposition
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
But what he look'd for should oppose and she
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The woman's, flattering, hers, deceiving, hers,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers, revenges, hers,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Why, hers, in part or all, but rather, all,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
For even to vice
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
They are not constant but are changing still
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
One vice, but of a minute old, for one
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
In a true hate, to pray they have their will
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The very devils cannot plague them better.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Exit
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
ACT III
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN,  and Lords at one door, and at another, CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants
CYMBELINE:
Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
CAIUS LUCIUS:
When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain
CAIUS LUCIUS:
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Than in his feats deserving it--for him
CAIUS LUCIUS:
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Is left untender'd.
QUEEN:
And, to kill the marvel,
QUEEN:
Shall be so ever.
CLOTEN:
There be many Caesars,
CLOTEN:
Ere such another Julius. Britain is
CLOTEN:
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
CLOTEN:
For wearing our own noses.
QUEEN:
That opportunity
QUEEN:
Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
QUEEN:
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
QUEEN:
The kings your ancestors, together with
QUEEN:
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
QUEEN:
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
QUEEN:
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,
QUEEN:
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,
QUEEN:
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
QUEEN:
Caesar made here, but made not here his brag
QUEEN:
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--
QUEEN:
That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
QUEEN:
From off our coast, twice beaten, and his shipping--
QUEEN:
Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,
QUEEN:
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd
QUEEN:
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
QUEEN:
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--
QUEEN:
O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,
QUEEN:
Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
QUEEN:
And Britons strut with courage.
CLOTEN:
Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our
CLOTEN:
kingdom is stronger than it was at that time, and,
CLOTEN:
as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of
CLOTEN:
them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such
CLOTEN:
straight arms, none.
CYMBELINE:
Son, let your mother end.
CLOTEN:
We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
CLOTEN:
Cassibelan: I do not say I am one, but I have a
CLOTEN:
hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If
CLOTEN:
Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or
CLOTEN:
put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute
CLOTEN:
for light, else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.
CYMBELINE:
You must know,
CYMBELINE:
Till the injurious Romans did extort
CYMBELINE:
This tribute from us, we were free
CYMBELINE:
Caesar's ambition,
CYMBELINE:
Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
CYMBELINE:
The sides o' the world, against all colour here
CYMBELINE:
Did put the yoke upon 's, which to shake off
CYMBELINE:
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
CYMBELINE:
Ourselves to be.
Lords:
We do.
CYMBELINE:
Say, then, to Caesar,
CYMBELINE:
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
CYMBELINE:
Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar
CYMBELINE:
Hath too much mangled, whose repair and franchise
CYMBELINE:
Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
CYMBELINE:
Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,
CYMBELINE:
Who was the first of Britain which did put
CYMBELINE:
His brows within a golden crown and call'd
CYMBELINE:
Himself a king.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
I am sorry, Cymbeline,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
CAIUS LUCIUS:
In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
CAIUS LUCIUS:
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
I thank thee for myself.
CYMBELINE:
Thou art welcome, Caius.
CYMBELINE:
Thy Caesar knighted me, my youth I spent
CYMBELINE:
Much under him, of him I gather'd honour,
CYMBELINE:
Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
CYMBELINE:
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
CYMBELINE:
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
CYMBELINE:
Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent
CYMBELINE:
Which not to read would show the Britons cold
CYMBELINE:
So Caesar shall not find them.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Let proof speak.
CLOTEN:
His majesty bids you welcome. Make
CLOTEN:
pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if
CLOTEN:
you seek us afterwards in other terms, you
CLOTEN:
shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you
CLOTEN:
beat us out of it, it is yours, if you fall in
CLOTEN:
the adventure, our crows shall fare the better
CLOTEN:
for you, and there's an end.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
So, sir.
CYMBELINE:
I know your master's pleasure and he mine
CYMBELINE:
All the remain is 'Welcome!'
CYMBELINE:
Exeunt
CYMBELINE:
SCENE II. Another room in the palace.
CYMBELINE:
Enter PISANIO, with a letter
PISANIO:
How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
PISANIO:
What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,
PISANIO:
O master! what a strange infection
PISANIO:
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,
PISANIO:
As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd
PISANIO:
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No
PISANIO:
She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
PISANIO:
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
PISANIO:
As would take in some virtue. O my master!
PISANIO:
Thy mind to her is now as low as were
PISANIO:
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?
PISANIO:
Upon the love and truth and vows which I
PISANIO:
Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?
PISANIO:
If it be so to do good service, never
PISANIO:
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,
PISANIO:
That I should seem to lack humanity
PISANIO:
so much as this fact comes to?
PISANIO:
Reading
PISANIO:
'Do't: the letter
PISANIO:
that I have sent her, by her own command
PISANIO:
Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!
PISANIO:
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
PISANIO:
Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st
PISANIO:
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
PISANIO:
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
PISANIO:
Enter IMOGEN
IMOGEN:
How now, Pisanio!
PISANIO:
Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
IMOGEN:
Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!
IMOGEN:
O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
IMOGEN:
That knew the stars as I his characters,
IMOGEN:
He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,
IMOGEN:
Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
IMOGEN:
Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not
IMOGEN:
That we two are asunder, let that grieve him
IMOGEN:
Some griefs are med'cinable, that is one of them,
IMOGEN:
For it doth physic love: of his content,
IMOGEN:
All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
IMOGEN:
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
IMOGEN:
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike
IMOGEN:
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
IMOGEN:
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
IMOGEN:
Reads
IMOGEN:
'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me
IMOGEN:
in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as
IMOGEN:
you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me
IMOGEN:
with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,
IMOGEN:
at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of
IMOGEN:
this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all
IMOGEN:
happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,
IMOGEN:
increasing in love,
IMOGEN:
LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'
IMOGEN:
O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
IMOGEN:
He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me
IMOGEN:
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
IMOGEN:
May plod it in a week, why may not I
IMOGEN:
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--
IMOGEN:
Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord, who long'st,--
IMOGEN:
let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,
IMOGEN:
But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me,
IMOGEN:
For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick,
IMOGEN:
Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
IMOGEN:
To the smothering of the sense--how far it is
IMOGEN:
To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
IMOGEN:
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
IMOGEN:
To inherit such a haven: but first of all,
IMOGEN:
How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
IMOGEN:
That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
IMOGEN:
And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence
IMOGEN:
Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?
IMOGEN:
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
IMOGEN:
How many score of miles may we well ride
IMOGEN:
'Twixt hour and hour?
PISANIO:
One score 'twixt sun and sun,
PISANIO:
Madam, 's enough for you
PISANIO:
Aside
PISANIO:
and too much too.
IMOGEN:
Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
IMOGEN:
Could never go so slow: I have heard of
IMOGEN:
riding wagers,
IMOGEN:
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
IMOGEN:
That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery
IMOGEN:
Go bid my woman feign a sickness, say
IMOGEN:
She'll home to her father: and provide me presently
IMOGEN:
A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
IMOGEN:
A franklin's housewife.
PISANIO:
Madam, you're best consider.
IMOGEN:
I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,
IMOGEN:
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,
IMOGEN:
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee,
IMOGEN:
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,
IMOGEN:
Accessible is none but Milford way.
IMOGEN:
Exeunt
IMOGEN:
SCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.
IMOGEN:
Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS following
BELARIUS:
A goodly day not to keep house, with such
BELARIUS:
Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys, this gate
BELARIUS:
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
BELARIUS:
To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs
BELARIUS:
Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
BELARIUS:
And keep their impious turbans on, without
BELARIUS:
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
BELARIUS:
We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
BELARIUS:
As prouder livers do.
GUIDERIUS:
Hail, heaven!
ARVIRAGUS:
Hail, heaven!
BELARIUS:
Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill,
BELARIUS:
Your legs are young, I'll tread these flats. Consider,
BELARIUS:
When you above perceive me like a crow,
BELARIUS:
That it is place which lessens and sets off,
BELARIUS:
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
BELARIUS:
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war
BELARIUS:
This service is not service, so being done,
BELARIUS:
But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,
BELARIUS:
Draws us a profit from all things we see,
BELARIUS:
And often, to our comfort, shall we find
BELARIUS:
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
BELARIUS:
Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
BELARIUS:
Is nobler than attending for a cheque,
BELARIUS:
Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,
BELARIUS:
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk
BELARIUS:
Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,
BELARIUS:
Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.
GUIDERIUS:
Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,
GUIDERIUS:
Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not
GUIDERIUS:
What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
GUIDERIUS:
If quiet life be best, sweeter to you
GUIDERIUS:
That have a sharper known, well corresponding
GUIDERIUS:
With your stiff age: but unto us it is
GUIDERIUS:
A cell of ignorance, travelling a-bed,
GUIDERIUS:
A prison for a debtor, that not dares
GUIDERIUS:
To stride a limit.
ARVIRAGUS:
What should we speak of
ARVIRAGUS:
When we are old as you? when we shall hear
ARVIRAGUS:
The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
ARVIRAGUS:
In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse
ARVIRAGUS:
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing,
ARVIRAGUS:
We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,
ARVIRAGUS:
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat,
ARVIRAGUS:
Our valour is to chase what flies, our cage
ARVIRAGUS:
We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,
ARVIRAGUS:
And sing our bondage freely.
BELARIUS:
How you speak!
BELARIUS:
Did you but know the city's usuries
BELARIUS:
And felt them knowingly, the art o' the court
BELARIUS:
As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb
BELARIUS:
Is certain falling, or so slippery that
BELARIUS:
The fear's as bad as falling, the toil o' the war,
BELARIUS:
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
BELARIUS:
I' the name of fame and honour, which dies i'
BELARIUS:
the search,
BELARIUS:
And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
BELARIUS:
As record of fair act, nay, many times,
BELARIUS:
Doth ill deserve by doing well, what's worse,
BELARIUS:
Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story
BELARIUS:
The world may read in me: my body's mark'd
BELARIUS:
With Roman swords, and my report was once
BELARIUS:
First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,
BELARIUS:
And when a soldier was the theme, my name
BELARIUS:
Was not far off: then was I as a tree
BELARIUS:
Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,
BELARIUS:
A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
BELARIUS:
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
BELARIUS:
And left me bare to weather.
GUIDERIUS:
Uncertain favour!
BELARIUS:
My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
BELARIUS:
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
BELARIUS:
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
BELARIUS:
I was confederate with the Romans: so
BELARIUS:
Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
BELARIUS:
This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
BELARIUS:
Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
BELARIUS:
More pious debts to heaven than in all
BELARIUS:
The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
BELARIUS:
This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
BELARIUS:
The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast,
BELARIUS:
To him the other two shall minister,
BELARIUS:
And we will fear no poison, which attends
BELARIUS:
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
BELARIUS:
Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
BELARIUS:
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
BELARIUS:
These boys know little they are sons to the king,
BELARIUS:
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
BELARIUS:
They think they are mine, and though train'd
BELARIUS:
up thus meanly
BELARIUS:
I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
BELARIUS:
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
BELARIUS:
In simple and low things to prince it much
BELARIUS:
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
BELARIUS:
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
BELARIUS:
The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!
BELARIUS:
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
BELARIUS:
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
BELARIUS:
Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,
BELARIUS:
And thus I set my foot on 's neck,' even then
BELARIUS:
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
BELARIUS:
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
BELARIUS:
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
BELARIUS:
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,
BELARIUS:
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
BELARIUS:
His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!
BELARIUS:
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
BELARIUS:
Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,
BELARIUS:
At three and two years old, I stole these babes,
BELARIUS:
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
BELARIUS:
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,
BELARIUS:
Thou wast their nurse, they took thee for
BELARIUS:
their mother,
BELARIUS:
And every day do honour to her grave
BELARIUS:
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
BELARIUS:
They take for natural father. The game is up.
BELARIUS:
Exit
BELARIUS:
SCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.
BELARIUS:
Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN
IMOGEN:
Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
IMOGEN:
Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
IMOGEN:
To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!
IMOGEN:
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,
IMOGEN:
That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
IMOGEN:
From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,
IMOGEN:
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
IMOGEN:
Beyond self-explication: put thyself
IMOGEN:
Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness
IMOGEN:
Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
IMOGEN:
Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with
IMOGEN:
A look untender? If't be summer news,
IMOGEN:
Smile to't before, if winterly, thou need'st
IMOGEN:
But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!
IMOGEN:
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
IMOGEN:
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
IMOGEN:
May take off some extremity, which to read
IMOGEN:
Would be even mortal to me.
PISANIO:
Please you, read,
PISANIO:
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
PISANIO:
The most disdain'd of fortune.
IMOGEN:
[Reads]  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the
IMOGEN:
strumpet in my bed, the testimonies whereof lie
IMOGEN:
bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,
IMOGEN:
but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
IMOGEN:
as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,
IMOGEN:
must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with
IMOGEN:
the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away
IMOGEN:
her life: I shall give thee opportunity at
IMOGEN:
Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose
IMOGEN:
where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
IMOGEN:
it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
IMOGEN:
equally to me disloyal.'
PISANIO:
What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
PISANIO:
Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
PISANIO:
Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
PISANIO:
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
PISANIO:
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
PISANIO:
All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,
PISANIO:
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
PISANIO:
This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?
IMOGEN:
False to his bed! What is it to be false?
IMOGEN:
To lie in watch there and to think on him?
IMOGEN:
To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep
IMOGEN:
charge nature,
IMOGEN:
To break it with a fearful dream of him
IMOGEN:
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?
PISANIO:
Alas, good lady!
IMOGEN:
I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,
IMOGEN:
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency,
IMOGEN:
Thou then look'dst like a villain, now methinks
IMOGEN:
Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy
IMOGEN:
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him
IMOGEN:
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,
IMOGEN:
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
IMOGEN:
I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,
IMOGEN:
Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
IMOGEN:
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
IMOGEN:
Put on for villany, not born where't grows,
IMOGEN:
But worn a bait for ladies.
PISANIO:
Good madam, hear me.
IMOGEN:
True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,
IMOGEN:
Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
IMOGEN:
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
IMOGEN:
From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,
IMOGEN:
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men,
IMOGEN:
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
IMOGEN:
From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest
IMOGEN:
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,
IMOGEN:
A little witness my obedience: look!
IMOGEN:
I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit
IMOGEN:
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart,
IMOGEN:
Fear not, 'tis empty of all things but grief,
IMOGEN:
Thy master is not there, who was indeed
IMOGEN:
The riches of it: do his bidding, strike
IMOGEN:
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,
IMOGEN:
But now thou seem'st a coward.
PISANIO:
Hence, vile instrument!
PISANIO:
Thou shalt not damn my hand.
IMOGEN:
Why, I must die,
IMOGEN:
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
IMOGEN:
No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
IMOGEN:
There is a prohibition so divine
IMOGEN:
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.
IMOGEN:
Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence,
IMOGEN:
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
IMOGEN:
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
IMOGEN:
All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
IMOGEN:
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
IMOGEN:
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
IMOGEN:
Believe false teachers: though those that
IMOGEN:
are betray'd
IMOGEN:
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
IMOGEN:
Stands in worse case of woe.
IMOGEN:
And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
IMOGEN:
My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
IMOGEN:
And make me put into contempt the suits
IMOGEN:
Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
IMOGEN:
It is no act of common passage, but
IMOGEN:
A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
IMOGEN:
To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
IMOGEN:
That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
IMOGEN:
Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch
IMOGEN:
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
IMOGEN:
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
IMOGEN:
When I desire it too.
PISANIO:
O gracious lady,
PISANIO:
Since I received command to do this business
PISANIO:
I have not slept one wink.
IMOGEN:
Do't, and to bed then.
PISANIO:
I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.
IMOGEN:
Wherefore then
IMOGEN:
Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
IMOGEN:
So many miles with a pretence? this place?
IMOGEN:
Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
IMOGEN:
The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
IMOGEN:
For my being absent? whereunto I never
IMOGEN:
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
IMOGEN:
To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
IMOGEN:
The elected deer before thee?
PISANIO:
But to win time
PISANIO:
To lose so bad employment, in the which
PISANIO:
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
PISANIO:
Hear me with patience.
IMOGEN:
Talk thy tongue weary, speak
IMOGEN:
I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear
IMOGEN:
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
IMOGEN:
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
PISANIO:
Then, madam,
PISANIO:
I thought you would not back again.
IMOGEN:
Most like,
IMOGEN:
Bringing me here to kill me.
PISANIO:
Not so, neither
PISANIO:
But if I were as wise as honest, then
PISANIO:
My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
PISANIO:
But that my master is abused
PISANIO:
Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.
PISANIO:
Hath done you both this cursed injury.
IMOGEN:
Some Roman courtezan.
PISANIO:
No, on my life.
PISANIO:
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
PISANIO:
Some bloody sign of it, for 'tis commanded
PISANIO:
I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
PISANIO:
And that will well confirm it.
IMOGEN:
Why good fellow,
IMOGEN:
What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?
IMOGEN:
Or in my life what comfort, when I am
IMOGEN:
Dead to my husband?
PISANIO:
If you'll back to the court--
IMOGEN:
No court, no father, nor no more ado
IMOGEN:
With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
IMOGEN:
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
IMOGEN:
As fearful as a siege.
PISANIO:
If not at court,
PISANIO:
Then not in Britain must you bide.
IMOGEN:
Where then
IMOGEN:
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
IMOGEN:
Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume
IMOGEN:
Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't,
IMOGEN:
In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think
IMOGEN:
There's livers out of Britain.
PISANIO:
I am most glad
PISANIO:
You think of other place. The ambassador,
PISANIO:
Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
PISANIO:
To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind
PISANIO:
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
PISANIO:
That which, to appear itself, must not yet be
PISANIO:
But by self-danger, you should tread a course
PISANIO:
Pretty and full of view, yea, haply, near
PISANIO:
The residence of Posthumus, so nigh at least
PISANIO:
That though his actions were not visible, yet
PISANIO:
Report should render him hourly to your ear
PISANIO:
As truly as he moves.
IMOGEN:
O, for such means!
IMOGEN:
Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
IMOGEN:
I would adventure.
PISANIO:
Well, then, here's the point
PISANIO:
You must forget to be a woman, change
PISANIO:
Command into obedience: fear and niceness--
PISANIO:
The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
PISANIO:
Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage
PISANIO:
Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and
PISANIO:
As quarrelous as the weasel, nay, you must
PISANIO:
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
PISANIO:
Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
PISANIO:
Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch
PISANIO:
Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
PISANIO:
Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
PISANIO:
You made great Juno angry.
IMOGEN:
Nay, be brief
IMOGEN:
I see into thy end, and am almost
IMOGEN:
A man already.
PISANIO:
First, make yourself but like one.
PISANIO:
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--
PISANIO:
'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all
PISANIO:
That answer to them: would you in their serving,
PISANIO:
And with what imitation you can borrow
PISANIO:
From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius
PISANIO:
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
PISANIO:
wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,
PISANIO:
If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless
PISANIO:
With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable
PISANIO:
And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,
PISANIO:
You have me, rich, and I will never fail
PISANIO:
Beginning nor supplyment.
IMOGEN:
Thou art all the comfort
IMOGEN:
The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away
IMOGEN:
There's more to be consider'd, but we'll even
IMOGEN:
All that good time will give us: this attempt
IMOGEN:
I am soldier to, and will abide it with
IMOGEN:
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
PISANIO:
Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
PISANIO:
Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
PISANIO:
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
PISANIO:
Here is a box, I had it from the queen
PISANIO:
What's in't is precious, if you are sick at sea,
PISANIO:
Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
PISANIO:
Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
PISANIO:
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
PISANIO:
Direct you to the best!
IMOGEN:
Amen: I thank thee.
IMOGEN:
Exeunt, severally
IMOGEN:
SCENE V. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
IMOGEN:
Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, Lords, and Attendants
CYMBELINE:
Thus far, and so farewell.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Thanks, royal sir.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
And am right sorry that I must report ye
CAIUS LUCIUS:
My master's enemy.
CYMBELINE:
Our subjects, sir,
CYMBELINE:
Will not endure his yoke, and for ourself
CYMBELINE:
To show less sovereignty than they, must needs
CYMBELINE:
Appear unkinglike.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
So, sir: I desire of you
CAIUS LUCIUS:
A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Madam, all joy befal your grace!
QUEEN:
And you!
CYMBELINE:
My lords, you are appointed for that office,
CYMBELINE:
The due of honour in no point omit.
CYMBELINE:
So farewell, noble Lucius.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Your hand, my lord.
CLOTEN:
Receive it friendly, but from this time forth
CLOTEN:
I wear it as your enemy.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Sir, the event
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.
CYMBELINE:
Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
CYMBELINE:
Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!
CYMBELINE:
Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords
QUEEN:
He goes hence frowning: but it honours us
QUEEN:
That we have given him cause.
CLOTEN:
'Tis all the better,
CLOTEN:
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
CYMBELINE:
Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
CYMBELINE:
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
CYMBELINE:
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness
CYMBELINE:
The powers that he already hath in Gallia
CYMBELINE:
Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
CYMBELINE:
His war for Britain.
QUEEN:
'Tis not sleepy business,
QUEEN:
But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.
CYMBELINE:
Our expectation that it would be thus
CYMBELINE:
Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
CYMBELINE:
Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
CYMBELINE:
Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
CYMBELINE:
The duty of the day: she looks us like
CYMBELINE:
A thing more made of malice than of duty
CYMBELINE:
We have noted it. Call her before us, for
CYMBELINE:
We have been too slight in sufferance.
CYMBELINE:
Exit an Attendant
QUEEN:
Royal sir,
QUEEN:
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
QUEEN:
Hath her life been, the cure whereof, my lord,
QUEEN:
'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,
QUEEN:
Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady
QUEEN:
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
QUEEN:
And strokes death to her.
QUEEN:
Re-enter Attendant
CYMBELINE:
Where is she, sir? How
CYMBELINE:
Can her contempt be answer'd?
Attendant:
Please you, sir,
Attendant:
Her chambers are all lock'd, and there's no answer
Attendant:
That will be given to the loudest noise we make.
QUEEN:
My lord, when last I went to visit her,
QUEEN:
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
QUEEN:
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,
QUEEN:
She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
QUEEN:
Which daily she was bound to proffer: this
QUEEN:
She wish'd me to make known, but our great court
QUEEN:
Made me to blame in memory.
CYMBELINE:
Her doors lock'd?
CYMBELINE:
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
CYMBELINE:
Prove false!
CYMBELINE:
Exit
QUEEN:
Son, I say, follow the king.
CLOTEN:
That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
CLOTEN:
have not seen these two days.
QUEEN:
Go, look after.
QUEEN:
Exit CLOTEN
QUEEN:
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
QUEEN:
He hath a drug of mine, I pray his absence
QUEEN:
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
QUEEN:
It is a thing most precious. But for her,
QUEEN:
Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,
QUEEN:
Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
QUEEN:
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
QUEEN:
To death or to dishonour, and my end
QUEEN:
Can make good use of either: she being down,
QUEEN:
I have the placing of the British crown.
QUEEN:
Re-enter CLOTEN
QUEEN:
How now, my son!
CLOTEN:
'Tis certain she is fled.
CLOTEN:
Go in and cheer the king: he rages, none
CLOTEN:
Dare come about him.
QUEEN:
[Aside]            All the better: may
QUEEN:
This night forestall him of the coming day!
QUEEN:
Exit
CLOTEN:
I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,
CLOTEN:
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
CLOTEN:
Than lady, ladies, woman, from every one
CLOTEN:
The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
CLOTEN:
Outsells them all, I love her therefore: but
CLOTEN:
Disdaining me and throwing favours on
CLOTEN:
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
CLOTEN:
That what's else rare is choked, and in that point
CLOTEN:
I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
CLOTEN:
To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--
CLOTEN:
Enter PISANIO
CLOTEN:
Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
CLOTEN:
Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,
CLOTEN:
Where is thy lady? In a word, or else
CLOTEN:
Thou art straightway with the fiends.
PISANIO:
O, good my lord!
CLOTEN:
Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--
CLOTEN:
I will not ask again. Close villain,
CLOTEN:
I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
CLOTEN:
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
CLOTEN:
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
CLOTEN:
A dram of worth be drawn.
PISANIO:
Alas, my lord,
PISANIO:
How can she be with him? When was she missed?
PISANIO:
He is in Rome.
CLOTEN:
Where is she, sir? Come nearer,
CLOTEN:
No further halting: satisfy me home
CLOTEN:
What is become of her.
PISANIO:
O, my all-worthy lord!
CLOTEN:
All-worthy villain!
CLOTEN:
Discover where thy mistress is at once,
CLOTEN:
At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'
CLOTEN:
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
CLOTEN:
Thy condemnation and thy death.
PISANIO:
Then, sir,
PISANIO:
This paper is the history of my knowledge
PISANIO:
Touching her flight.
PISANIO:
Presenting a letter
CLOTEN:
Let's see't. I will pursue her
CLOTEN:
Even to Augustus' throne.
PISANIO:
[Aside]                 Or this, or perish.
PISANIO:
She's far enough, and what he learns by this
PISANIO:
May prove his travel, not her danger.
CLOTEN:
Hum!
PISANIO:
[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
PISANIO:
Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
CLOTEN:
Sirrah, is this letter true?
PISANIO:
Sir, as I think.
CLOTEN:
It is Posthumus' hand, I know't. Sirrah, if thou
CLOTEN:
wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,
CLOTEN:
undergo those employments wherein I should have
CLOTEN:
cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,
CLOTEN:
what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it
CLOTEN:
directly and truly, I would think thee an honest
CLOTEN:
man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
CLOTEN:
relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
PISANIO:
Well, my good lord.
CLOTEN:
Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and
CLOTEN:
constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
CLOTEN:
that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the
CLOTEN:
course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of
CLOTEN:
mine: wilt thou serve me?
PISANIO:
Sir, I will.
CLOTEN:
Give me thy hand, here's my purse. Hast any of thy
CLOTEN:
late master's garments in thy possession?
PISANIO:
I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he
PISANIO:
wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
CLOTEN:
The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit
CLOTEN:
hither: let it be thy lint service, go.
PISANIO:
I shall, my lord.
PISANIO:
Exit
CLOTEN:
Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one
CLOTEN:
thing, I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou
CLOTEN:
villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these
CLOTEN:
garments were come. She said upon a time--the
CLOTEN:
bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she
CLOTEN:
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
CLOTEN:
than my noble and natural person together with the
CLOTEN:
adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my
CLOTEN:
back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her
CLOTEN:
eyes, there shall she see my valour, which will then
CLOTEN:
be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my
CLOTEN:
speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and
CLOTEN:
when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex
CLOTEN:
her I will execute in the clothes that she so
CLOTEN:
praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot
CLOTEN:
her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,
CLOTEN:
and I'll be merry in my revenge.
CLOTEN:
Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes
CLOTEN:
Be those the garments?
PISANIO:
Ay, my noble lord.
CLOTEN:
How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?
PISANIO:
She can scarce be there yet.
CLOTEN:
Bring this apparel to my chamber, that is the second
CLOTEN:
thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,
CLOTEN:
that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be
CLOTEN:
but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself
CLOTEN:
to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had
CLOTEN:
wings to follow it! Come, and be true.
CLOTEN:
Exit
PISANIO:
Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee
PISANIO:
Were to prove false, which I will never be,
PISANIO:
To him that is most true. To Milford go,
PISANIO:
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
PISANIO:
You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed
PISANIO:
Be cross'd with slowness, labour be his meed!
PISANIO:
Exit
PISANIO:
SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.
PISANIO:
Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothes
IMOGEN:
I see a man's life is a tedious one
IMOGEN:
I have tired myself, and for two nights together
IMOGEN:
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,
IMOGEN:
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
IMOGEN:
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
IMOGEN:
Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think
IMOGEN:
Foundations fly the wretched, such, I mean,
IMOGEN:
Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me
IMOGEN:
I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,
IMOGEN:
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
IMOGEN:
A punishment or trial? Yes, no wonder,
IMOGEN:
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
IMOGEN:
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
IMOGEN:
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
IMOGEN:
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,
IMOGEN:
My hunger's gone, but even before, I was
IMOGEN:
At point to sink for food. But what is this?
IMOGEN:
Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold
IMOGEN:
I were best not to call, I dare not call
IMOGEN:
yet famine,
IMOGEN:
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,
IMOGEN:
Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever
IMOGEN:
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
IMOGEN:
If any thing that's civil, speak, if savage,
IMOGEN:
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.
IMOGEN:
Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy
IMOGEN:
But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.
IMOGEN:
Such a foe, good heavens!
IMOGEN:
Exit, to the cave
IMOGEN:
Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS
BELARIUS:
You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and
BELARIUS:
Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I
BELARIUS:
Will play the cook and servant, 'tis our match
BELARIUS:
The sweat of industry would dry and die,
BELARIUS:
But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs
BELARIUS:
Will make what's homely savoury: weariness
BELARIUS:
Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
BELARIUS:
Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
BELARIUS:
Poor house, that keep'st thyself!
GUIDERIUS:
I am thoroughly weary.
ARVIRAGUS:
I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
GUIDERIUS:
There is cold meat i' the cave, we'll browse on that,
GUIDERIUS:
Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
BELARIUS:
[Looking into the cave]
BELARIUS:
Stay, come not in.
BELARIUS:
But that it eats our victuals, I should think
BELARIUS:
Here were a fairy.
GUIDERIUS:
What's the matter, sir?
BELARIUS:
By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
BELARIUS:
An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
BELARIUS:
No elder than a boy!
BELARIUS:
Re-enter IMOGEN
IMOGEN:
Good masters, harm me not
IMOGEN:
Before I enter'd here, I call'd, and thought
IMOGEN:
To have begg'd or bought what I have took
IMOGEN:
good troth,
IMOGEN:
I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found
IMOGEN:
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat
IMOGEN:
I would have left it on the board so soon
IMOGEN:
As I had made my meal, and parted
IMOGEN:
With prayers for the provider.
GUIDERIUS:
Money, youth?
ARVIRAGUS:
All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
ARVIRAGUS:
As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those
ARVIRAGUS:
Who worship dirty gods.
IMOGEN:
I see you're angry
IMOGEN:
Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
IMOGEN:
Have died had I not made it.
BELARIUS:
Whither bound?
IMOGEN:
To Milford-Haven.
BELARIUS:
What's your name?
IMOGEN:
Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
IMOGEN:
Is bound for Italy, he embark'd at Milford,
IMOGEN:
To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
IMOGEN:
I am fall'n in this offence.
BELARIUS:
Prithee, fair youth,
BELARIUS:
Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
BELARIUS:
By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!
BELARIUS:
'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer
BELARIUS:
Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.
BELARIUS:
Boys, bid him welcome.
GUIDERIUS:
Were you a woman, youth,
GUIDERIUS:
I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,
GUIDERIUS:
I bid for you as I'd buy.
ARVIRAGUS:
I'll make't my comfort
ARVIRAGUS:
He is a man, I'll love him as my brother
ARVIRAGUS:
And such a welcome as I'd give to him
ARVIRAGUS:
After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!
ARVIRAGUS:
Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.
IMOGEN:
'Mongst friends,
IMOGEN:
If brothers.
IMOGEN:
Aside
IMOGEN:
Would it had been so, that they
IMOGEN:
Had been my father's sons! then had my prize
IMOGEN:
Been less, and so more equal ballasting
IMOGEN:
To thee, Posthumus.
BELARIUS:
He wrings at some distress.
GUIDERIUS:
Would I could free't!
ARVIRAGUS:
Or I, whate'er it be,
ARVIRAGUS:
What pain it cost, what danger. God's!
BELARIUS:
Hark, boys.
BELARIUS:
Whispering
IMOGEN:
Great men,
IMOGEN:
That had a court no bigger than this cave,
IMOGEN:
That did attend themselves and had the virtue
IMOGEN:
Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by
IMOGEN:
That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--
IMOGEN:
Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
IMOGEN:
I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
IMOGEN:
Since Leonatus's false.
BELARIUS:
It shall be so.
BELARIUS:
Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in
BELARIUS:
Discourse is heavy, fasting, when we have supp'd,
BELARIUS:
We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
BELARIUS:
So far as thou wilt speak it.
GUIDERIUS:
Pray, draw near.
ARVIRAGUS:
The night to the owl and morn to the lark
ARVIRAGUS:
less welcome.
IMOGEN:
Thanks, sir.
ARVIRAGUS:
I pray, draw near.
ARVIRAGUS:
Exeunt
ARVIRAGUS:
SCENE VII. Rome. A public place.
ARVIRAGUS:
Enter two Senators and Tribunes
First Senator:
This is the tenor of the emperor's writ
First Senator:
That since the common men are now in action
First Senator:
'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
First Senator:
And that the legions now in Gallia are
First Senator:
Full weak to undertake our wars against
First Senator:
The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
First Senator:
The gentry to this business. He creates
First Senator:
Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,
First Senator:
For this immediate levy, he commends
First Senator:
His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
First Tribune:
Is Lucius general of the forces?
Second Senator:
Ay.
First Tribune:
Remaining now in Gallia?
First Senator:
With those legions
First Senator:
Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
First Senator:
Must be supplyant: the words of your commission
First Senator:
Will tie you to the numbers and the time
First Senator:
Of their dispatch.
First Tribune:
We will discharge our duty.
First Tribune:
Exeunt
First Tribune:
ACT IV
First Tribune:
SCENE I. Wales: near the cave of Belarius.
First Tribune:
Enter CLOTEN
CLOTEN:
I am near to the place where they should meet, if
CLOTEN:
Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments
CLOTEN:
serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by
CLOTEN:
him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the
CLOTEN:
rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said
CLOTEN:
a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must
CLOTEN:
play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it
CLOTEN:
is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer
CLOTEN:
in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are
CLOTEN:
as well drawn as his, no less young, more strong,
CLOTEN:
not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the
CLOTEN:
advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike
CLOTEN:
conversant in general services, and more remarkable
CLOTEN:
in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant
CLOTEN:
thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!
CLOTEN:
Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy
CLOTEN:
shoulders, shall within this hour be off, thy
CLOTEN:
mistress enforced, thy garments cut to pieces before
CLOTEN:
thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her
CLOTEN:
father, who may haply be a little angry for my so
CLOTEN:
rough usage, but my mother, having power of his
CLOTEN:
testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My
CLOTEN:
horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore
CLOTEN:
purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is
CLOTEN:
the very description of their meeting-place, and
CLOTEN:
the fellow dares not deceive me.
CLOTEN:
Exit
CLOTEN:
SCENE II. Before the cave of Belarius.
CLOTEN:
Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN
BELARIUS:
[To IMOGEN]  You are not well: remain here in the cave,
BELARIUS:
We'll come to you after hunting.
ARVIRAGUS:
[To IMOGEN]	Brother, stay here
ARVIRAGUS:
Are we not brothers?
IMOGEN:
So man and man should be,
IMOGEN:
But clay and clay differs in dignity,
IMOGEN:
Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.
GUIDERIUS:
Go you to hunting, I'll abide with him.
IMOGEN:
So sick I am not, yet I am not well,
IMOGEN:
But not so citizen a wanton as
IMOGEN:
To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me,
IMOGEN:
Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
IMOGEN:
Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
IMOGEN:
Cannot amend me, society is no comfort
IMOGEN:
To one not sociable: I am not very sick,
IMOGEN:
Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here
IMOGEN:
I'll rob none but myself, and let me die,
IMOGEN:
Stealing so poorly.
GUIDERIUS:
I love thee, I have spoke it
GUIDERIUS:
How much the quantity, the weight as much,
GUIDERIUS:
As I do love my father.
BELARIUS:
What! how! how!
ARVIRAGUS:
If it be sin to say so, I yoke me
ARVIRAGUS:
In my good brother's fault: I know not why
ARVIRAGUS:
I love this youth, and I have heard you say,
ARVIRAGUS:
Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,
ARVIRAGUS:
And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say
ARVIRAGUS:
'My father, not this youth.'
BELARIUS:
[Aside]	O noble strain!
BELARIUS:
O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
BELARIUS:
Cowards father cowards and base things sire base
BELARIUS:
Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
BELARIUS:
I'm not their father, yet who this should be,
BELARIUS:
Doth miracle itself, loved before me.
BELARIUS:
'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.
ARVIRAGUS:
Brother, farewell.
IMOGEN:
I wish ye sport.
ARVIRAGUS:
You health. So please you, sir.
IMOGEN:
[Aside]  These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies
IMOGEN:
I have heard!
IMOGEN:
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court
IMOGEN:
Experience, O, thou disprovest report!
IMOGEN:
The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish
IMOGEN:
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
IMOGEN:
I am sick still, heart-sick. Pisanio,
IMOGEN:
I'll now taste of thy drug.
IMOGEN:
Swallows some
GUIDERIUS:
I could not stir him
GUIDERIUS:
He said he was gentle, but unfortunate,
GUIDERIUS:
Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.
ARVIRAGUS:
Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter
ARVIRAGUS:
I might know more.
BELARIUS:
To the field, to the field!
BELARIUS:
We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.
ARVIRAGUS:
We'll not be long away.
BELARIUS:
Pray, be not sick,
BELARIUS:
For you must be our housewife.
IMOGEN:
Well or ill,
IMOGEN:
I am bound to you.
BELARIUS:
And shalt be ever.
BELARIUS:
Exit IMOGEN, to the cave
BELARIUS:
This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had
BELARIUS:
Good ancestors.
ARVIRAGUS:
How angel-like he sings!
GUIDERIUS:
But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
GUIDERIUS:
In characters,
GUIDERIUS:
And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick
GUIDERIUS:
And he her dieter.
ARVIRAGUS:
Nobly he yokes
ARVIRAGUS:
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
ARVIRAGUS:
Was that it was, for not being such a smile,
ARVIRAGUS:
The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly
ARVIRAGUS:
From so divine a temple, to commix
ARVIRAGUS:
With winds that sailors rail at.
GUIDERIUS:
I do note
GUIDERIUS:
That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
GUIDERIUS:
Mingle their spurs together.
ARVIRAGUS:
Grow, patience!
ARVIRAGUS:
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
ARVIRAGUS:
His perishing root with the increasing vine!
BELARIUS:
It is great morning. Come, away!--
BELARIUS:
Who's there?
BELARIUS:
Enter CLOTEN
CLOTEN:
I cannot find those runagates, that villain
CLOTEN:
Hath mock'd me. I am faint.
BELARIUS:
'Those runagates!'
BELARIUS:
Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis
BELARIUS:
Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.
BELARIUS:
I saw him not these many years, and yet
BELARIUS:
I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!
GUIDERIUS:
He is but one: you and my brother search
GUIDERIUS:
What companies are near: pray you, away,
GUIDERIUS:
Let me alone with him.
GUIDERIUS:
Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
CLOTEN:
Soft! What are you
CLOTEN:
That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?
CLOTEN:
I have heard of such. What slave art thou?
GUIDERIUS:
A thing
GUIDERIUS:
More slavish did I ne'er than answering
GUIDERIUS:
A slave without a knock.
CLOTEN:
Thou art a robber,
CLOTEN:
A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.
GUIDERIUS:
To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I
GUIDERIUS:
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
GUIDERIUS:
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
GUIDERIUS:
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
GUIDERIUS:
Why I should yield to thee?
CLOTEN:
Thou villain base,
CLOTEN:
Know'st me not by my clothes?
GUIDERIUS:
No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
GUIDERIUS:
Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
GUIDERIUS:
Which, as it seems, make thee.
CLOTEN:
Thou precious varlet,
CLOTEN:
My tailor made them not.
GUIDERIUS:
Hence, then, and thank
GUIDERIUS:
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool,
GUIDERIUS:
I am loath to beat thee.
CLOTEN:
Thou injurious thief,
CLOTEN:
Hear but my name, and tremble.
GUIDERIUS:
What's thy name?
CLOTEN:
Cloten, thou villain.
GUIDERIUS:
Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
GUIDERIUS:
I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or
GUIDERIUS:
Adder, Spider,
GUIDERIUS:
'Twould move me sooner.
CLOTEN:
To thy further fear,
CLOTEN:
Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
CLOTEN:
I am son to the queen.
GUIDERIUS:
I am sorry for 't, not seeming
GUIDERIUS:
So worthy as thy birth.
CLOTEN:
Art not afeard?
GUIDERIUS:
Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise
GUIDERIUS:
At fools I laugh, not fear them.
CLOTEN:
Die the death
CLOTEN:
When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
CLOTEN:
I'll follow those that even now fled hence,
CLOTEN:
And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads
CLOTEN:
Yield, rustic mountaineer.
CLOTEN:
Exeunt, fighting
CLOTEN:
Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
BELARIUS:
No companies abroad?
ARVIRAGUS:
None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
BELARIUS:
I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,
BELARIUS:
But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
BELARIUS:
Which then he wore, the snatches in his voice,
BELARIUS:
And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute
BELARIUS:
'Twas very Cloten.
ARVIRAGUS:
In this place we left them
ARVIRAGUS:
I wish my brother make good time with him,
ARVIRAGUS:
You say he is so fell.
BELARIUS:
Being scarce made up,
BELARIUS:
I mean, to man, he had not apprehension
BELARIUS:
Of roaring terrors, for the effect of judgment
BELARIUS:
Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.
BELARIUS:
Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head
GUIDERIUS:
This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse,
GUIDERIUS:
There was no money in't: not Hercules
GUIDERIUS:
Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none
GUIDERIUS:
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
GUIDERIUS:
My head as I do his.
BELARIUS:
What hast thou done?
GUIDERIUS:
I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
GUIDERIUS:
Son to the queen, after his own report,
GUIDERIUS:
Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
GUIDERIUS:
With his own single hand he'ld take us in
GUIDERIUS:
Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,
GUIDERIUS:
And set them on Lud's-town.
BELARIUS:
We are all undone.
GUIDERIUS:
Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,
GUIDERIUS:
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
GUIDERIUS:
Protects not us: then why should we be tender
GUIDERIUS:
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
GUIDERIUS:
Play judge and executioner all himself,
GUIDERIUS:
For we do fear the law? What company
GUIDERIUS:
Discover you abroad?
BELARIUS:
No single soul
BELARIUS:
Can we set eye on, but in all safe reason
BELARIUS:
He must have some attendants. Though his humour
BELARIUS:
Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
BELARIUS:
From one bad thing to worse, not frenzy, not
BELARIUS:
Absolute madness could so far have raved
BELARIUS:
To bring him here alone, although perhaps
BELARIUS:
It may be heard at court that such as we
BELARIUS:
Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
BELARIUS:
May make some stronger head, the which he hearing--
BELARIUS:
As it is like him--might break out, and swear
BELARIUS:
He'ld fetch us in, yet is't not probable
BELARIUS:
To come alone, either he so undertaking,
BELARIUS:
Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,
BELARIUS:
If we do fear this body hath a tail
BELARIUS:
More perilous than the head.
ARVIRAGUS:
Let ordinance
ARVIRAGUS:
Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,
ARVIRAGUS:
My brother hath done well.
BELARIUS:
I had no mind
BELARIUS:
To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness
BELARIUS:
Did make my way long forth.
GUIDERIUS:
With his own sword,
GUIDERIUS:
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
GUIDERIUS:
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
GUIDERIUS:
Behind our rock, and let it to the sea,
GUIDERIUS:
And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten
GUIDERIUS:
That's all I reck.
GUIDERIUS:
Exit
BELARIUS:
I fear 'twill be revenged
BELARIUS:
Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour
BELARIUS:
Becomes thee well enough.
ARVIRAGUS:
Would I had done't
ARVIRAGUS:
So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,
ARVIRAGUS:
I love thee brotherly, but envy much
ARVIRAGUS:
Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,
ARVIRAGUS:
That possible strength might meet, would seek us through
ARVIRAGUS:
And put us to our answer.
BELARIUS:
Well, 'tis done
BELARIUS:
We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger
BELARIUS:
Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock,
BELARIUS:
You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay
BELARIUS:
Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him
BELARIUS:
To dinner presently.
ARVIRAGUS:
Poor sick Fidele!
ARVIRAGUS:
I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour
ARVIRAGUS:
I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,
ARVIRAGUS:
And praise myself for charity.
ARVIRAGUS:
Exit
BELARIUS:
O thou goddess,
BELARIUS:
Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st
BELARIUS:
In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
BELARIUS:
As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
BELARIUS:
Not wagging his sweet head, and yet as rough,
BELARIUS:
Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,
BELARIUS:
That by the top doth take the mountain pine,
BELARIUS:
And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder
BELARIUS:
That an invisible instinct should frame them
BELARIUS:
To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,
BELARIUS:
Civility not seen from other, valour
BELARIUS:
That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
BELARIUS:
As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
BELARIUS:
What Cloten's being here to us portends,
BELARIUS:
Or what his death will bring us.
BELARIUS:
Re-enter GUIDERIUS
GUIDERIUS:
Where's my brother?
GUIDERIUS:
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
GUIDERIUS:
In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage
GUIDERIUS:
For his return.
GUIDERIUS:
Solemn music
BELARIUS:
My ingenious instrument!
BELARIUS:
Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion
BELARIUS:
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
GUIDERIUS:
Is he at home?
BELARIUS:
He went hence even now.
GUIDERIUS:
What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
GUIDERIUS:
it did not speak before. All solemn things
GUIDERIUS:
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
GUIDERIUS:
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
GUIDERIUS:
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
GUIDERIUS:
Is Cadwal mad?
BELARIUS:
Look, here he comes,
BELARIUS:
And brings the dire occasion in his arms
BELARIUS:
Of what we blame him for.
BELARIUS:
Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his arms
ARVIRAGUS:
The bird is dead
ARVIRAGUS:
That we have made so much on. I had rather
ARVIRAGUS:
Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
ARVIRAGUS:
To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,
ARVIRAGUS:
Than have seen this.
GUIDERIUS:
O sweetest, fairest lily!
GUIDERIUS:
My brother wears thee not the one half so well
GUIDERIUS:
As when thou grew'st thyself.
BELARIUS:
O melancholy!
BELARIUS:
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
BELARIUS:
The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare
BELARIUS:
Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
BELARIUS:
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made, but I,
BELARIUS:
Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
BELARIUS:
How found you him?
ARVIRAGUS:
Stark, as you see
ARVIRAGUS:
Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,
ARVIRAGUS:
Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at, his
ARVIRAGUS:
right cheek
ARVIRAGUS:
Reposing on a cushion.
GUIDERIUS:
Where?
ARVIRAGUS:
O' the floor,
ARVIRAGUS:
His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put
ARVIRAGUS:
My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
ARVIRAGUS:
Answer'd my steps too loud.
GUIDERIUS:
Why, he but sleeps
GUIDERIUS:
If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed,
GUIDERIUS:
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
GUIDERIUS:
And worms will not come to thee.
ARVIRAGUS:
With fairest flowers
ARVIRAGUS:
Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
ARVIRAGUS:
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
ARVIRAGUS:
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor
ARVIRAGUS:
The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor
ARVIRAGUS:
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
ARVIRAGUS:
Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,
ARVIRAGUS:
With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming
ARVIRAGUS:
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
ARVIRAGUS:
Without a monument!--bring thee all this,
ARVIRAGUS:
Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,
ARVIRAGUS:
To winter-ground thy corse.
GUIDERIUS:
Prithee, have done,
GUIDERIUS:
And do not play in wench-like words with that
GUIDERIUS:
Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
GUIDERIUS:
And not protract with admiration what
GUIDERIUS:
Is now due debt. To the grave!
ARVIRAGUS:
Say, where shall's lay him?
GUIDERIUS:
By good Euriphile, our mother.
ARVIRAGUS:
Be't so
ARVIRAGUS:
And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
ARVIRAGUS:
Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,
ARVIRAGUS:
As once our mother, use like note and words,
ARVIRAGUS:
Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
GUIDERIUS:
Cadwal,
GUIDERIUS:
I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee,
GUIDERIUS:
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
GUIDERIUS:
Than priests and fanes that lie.
ARVIRAGUS:
We'll speak it, then.
BELARIUS:
Great griefs, I see, medicine the less, for Cloten
BELARIUS:
Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys,
BELARIUS:
And though he came our enemy, remember
BELARIUS:
He was paid for that: though mean and
BELARIUS:
mighty, rotting
BELARIUS:
Together, have one dust, yet reverence,
BELARIUS:
That angel of the world, doth make distinction
BELARIUS:
Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely
BELARIUS:
And though you took his life, as being our foe,
BELARIUS:
Yet bury him as a prince.
GUIDERIUS:
Pray You, fetch him hither.
GUIDERIUS:
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
GUIDERIUS:
When neither are alive.
ARVIRAGUS:
If you'll go fetch him,
ARVIRAGUS:
We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.
ARVIRAGUS:
Exit BELARIUS
GUIDERIUS:
Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east,
GUIDERIUS:
My father hath a reason for't.
ARVIRAGUS:
'Tis true.
GUIDERIUS:
Come on then, and remove him.
ARVIRAGUS:
So. Begin.
ARVIRAGUS:
SONG
GUIDERIUS:
Fear no more the heat o' the sun,
GUIDERIUS:
Nor the furious winter's rages,
GUIDERIUS:
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
GUIDERIUS:
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages
GUIDERIUS:
Golden lads and girls all must,
GUIDERIUS:
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.
ARVIRAGUS:
Fear no more the frown o' the great,
ARVIRAGUS:
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke,
ARVIRAGUS:
Care no more to clothe and eat,
ARVIRAGUS:
To thee the reed is as the oak
ARVIRAGUS:
The sceptre, learning, physic, must
ARVIRAGUS:
All follow this, and come to dust.
GUIDERIUS:
Fear no more the lightning flash,
ARVIRAGUS:
Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone,
GUIDERIUS:
Fear not slander, censure rash,
ARVIRAGUS:
Thou hast finish'd joy and moan
ARVIRAGUS:
All lovers young, all lovers must
ARVIRAGUS:
Consign to thee, and come to dust.
GUIDERIUS:
No exorciser harm thee!
ARVIRAGUS:
Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
GUIDERIUS:
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
ARVIRAGUS:
Nothing ill come near thee!
ARVIRAGUS:
Quiet consummation have,
ARVIRAGUS:
And renowned be thy grave!
ARVIRAGUS:
Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTEN
GUIDERIUS:
We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.
BELARIUS:
Here's a few flowers, but 'bout midnight, more
BELARIUS:
The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night
BELARIUS:
Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.
BELARIUS:
You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so
BELARIUS:
These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.
BELARIUS:
Come on, away: apart upon our knees.
BELARIUS:
The ground that gave them first has them again
BELARIUS:
Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.
BELARIUS:
Exeunt BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS
IMOGEN:
[Awaking]  Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven, which is
IMOGEN:
the way?--
IMOGEN:
I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?
IMOGEN:
'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--
IMOGEN:
I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
IMOGEN:
But, soft! no bedfellow!--O god s and goddesses!
IMOGEN:
Seeing the body of CLOTEN
IMOGEN:
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world,
IMOGEN:
This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream,
IMOGEN:
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
IMOGEN:
And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so,
IMOGEN:
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
IMOGEN:
Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes
IMOGEN:
Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,
IMOGEN:
I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be
IMOGEN:
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
IMOGEN:
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
IMOGEN:
The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is
IMOGEN:
Without me, as within me, not imagined, felt.
IMOGEN:
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!
IMOGEN:
I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand,
IMOGEN:
His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,
IMOGEN:
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face
IMOGEN:
Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,
IMOGEN:
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
IMOGEN:
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
IMOGEN:
Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
IMOGEN:
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
IMOGEN:
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio
IMOGEN:
Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--
IMOGEN:
From this most bravest vessel of the world
IMOGEN:
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,
IMOGEN:
Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!
IMOGEN:
where's that?
IMOGEN:
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
IMOGEN:
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
IMOGEN:
'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them
IMOGEN:
Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
IMOGEN:
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
IMOGEN:
And cordial to me, have I not found it
IMOGEN:
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home
IMOGEN:
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!
IMOGEN:
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
IMOGEN:
That we the horrider may seem to those
IMOGEN:
Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!
IMOGEN:
Falls on the body
IMOGEN:
Enter LUCIUS, a Captain and other Officers, and a Soothsayer
Captain:
To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,
Captain:
After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
Captain:
You here at Milford-Haven with your ships
Captain:
They are in readiness.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
But what from Rome?
Captain:
The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
Captain:
And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,
Captain:
That promise noble service: and they come
Captain:
Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
Captain:
Syenna's brother.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
When expect you them?
Captain:
With the next benefit o' the wind.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
This forwardness
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Be muster'd, bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?
Soothsayer:
Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--
Soothsayer:
I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus
Soothsayer:
I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
Soothsayer:
From the spongy south to this part of the west,
Soothsayer:
There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--
Soothsayer:
Unless my sins abuse my divination--
Soothsayer:
Success to the Roman host.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Dream often so,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
CAIUS LUCIUS:
It was a worthy building. How! a page!
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
For nature doth abhor to make his bed
CAIUS LUCIUS:
With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Let's see the boy's face.
Captain:
He's alive, my lord.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
CAIUS LUCIUS:
They crave to be demanded. Who is this
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
CAIUS LUCIUS:
That, otherwise than noble nature did,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest
CAIUS LUCIUS:
In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?
CAIUS LUCIUS:
What art thou?
IMOGEN:
I am nothing: or if not,
IMOGEN:
Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
IMOGEN:
A very valiant Briton and a good,
IMOGEN:
That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
IMOGEN:
There is no more such masters: I may wander
IMOGEN:
From east to occident, cry out for service,
IMOGEN:
Try many, all good, serve truly, never
IMOGEN:
Find such another master.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
'Lack, good youth!
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.
IMOGEN:
Richard du Champ.
IMOGEN:
Aside
IMOGEN:
If I do lie and do
IMOGEN:
No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
IMOGEN:
They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Thy name?
IMOGEN:
Fidele, sir.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Thou dost approve thyself the very same
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.
IMOGEN:
I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,
IMOGEN:
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
IMOGEN:
As these poor pickaxes can dig, and when
IMOGEN:
With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,
IMOGEN:
And on it said a century of prayers,
IMOGEN:
Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh,
IMOGEN:
And leaving so his service, follow you,
IMOGEN:
So please you entertain me.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Ay, good youth!
CAIUS LUCIUS:
And rather father thee than master thee.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
My friends,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
And make him with our pikes and partisans
CAIUS LUCIUS:
A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
CAIUS LUCIUS:
By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd
CAIUS LUCIUS:
As soldiers can. Be cheerful, wipe thine eyes
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Some falls are means the happier to arise.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Exeunt
CAIUS LUCIUS:
SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Enter CYMBELINE, Lords, PISANIO, and Attendants
CYMBELINE:
Again, and bring me word how 'tis with her.
CYMBELINE:
Exit an Attendant
CYMBELINE:
A fever with the absence of her son,
CYMBELINE:
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
CYMBELINE:
How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
CYMBELINE:
The great part of my comfort, gone, my queen
CYMBELINE:
Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
CYMBELINE:
When fearful wars point at me, her son gone,
CYMBELINE:
So needful for this present: it strikes me, past
CYMBELINE:
The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
CYMBELINE:
Who needs must know of her departure and
CYMBELINE:
Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee
CYMBELINE:
By a sharp torture.
PISANIO:
Sir, my life is yours,
PISANIO:
I humbly set it at your will, but, for my mistress,
PISANIO:
I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
PISANIO:
Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,
PISANIO:
Hold me your loyal servant.
First Lord:
Good my liege,
First Lord:
The day that she was missing he was here
First Lord:
I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
First Lord:
All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
First Lord:
There wants no diligence in seeking him,
First Lord:
And will, no doubt, be found.
CYMBELINE:
The time is troublesome.
CYMBELINE:
To PISANIO
CYMBELINE:
We'll slip you for a season, but our jealousy
CYMBELINE:
Does yet depend.
First Lord:
So please your majesty,
First Lord:
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
First Lord:
Are landed on your coast, with a supply
First Lord:
Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.
CYMBELINE:
Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
CYMBELINE:
I am amazed with matter.
First Lord:
Good my liege,
First Lord:
Your preparation can affront no less
First Lord:
Than what you hear of: come more, for more
First Lord:
you're ready
First Lord:
The want is but to put those powers in motion
First Lord:
That long to move.
CYMBELINE:
I thank you. Let's withdraw,
CYMBELINE:
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
CYMBELINE:
What can from Italy annoy us, but
CYMBELINE:
We grieve at chances here. Away!
CYMBELINE:
Exeunt all but PISANIO
PISANIO:
I heard no letter from my master since
PISANIO:
I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange
PISANIO:
Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
PISANIO:
To yield me often tidings: neither know I
PISANIO:
What is betid to Cloten, but remain
PISANIO:
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
PISANIO:
Wherein I am false I am honest, not true, to be true.
PISANIO:
These present wars shall find I love my country,
PISANIO:
Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.
PISANIO:
All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd
PISANIO:
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.
PISANIO:
Exit
PISANIO:
SCENE IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius.
PISANIO:
Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.
GUIDERIUS:
The noise is round about us.
BELARIUS:
Let us from it.
ARVIRAGUS:
What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
ARVIRAGUS:
From action and adventure?
GUIDERIUS:
Nay, what hope
GUIDERIUS:
Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans
GUIDERIUS:
Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
GUIDERIUS:
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
GUIDERIUS:
During their use, and slay us after.
BELARIUS:
Sons,
BELARIUS:
We'll higher to the mountains, there secure us.
BELARIUS:
To the king's party there's no going: newness
BELARIUS:
Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd
BELARIUS:
Among the bands--may drive us to a render
BELARIUS:
Where we have lived, and so extort from's that
BELARIUS:
Which we have done, whose answer would be death
BELARIUS:
Drawn on with torture.
GUIDERIUS:
This is, sir, a doubt
GUIDERIUS:
In such a time nothing becoming you,
GUIDERIUS:
Nor satisfying us.
ARVIRAGUS:
It is not likely
ARVIRAGUS:
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
ARVIRAGUS:
Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes
ARVIRAGUS:
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
ARVIRAGUS:
That they will waste their time upon our note,
ARVIRAGUS:
To know from whence we are.
BELARIUS:
O, I am known
BELARIUS:
Of many in the army: many years,
BELARIUS:
Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
BELARIUS:
From my remembrance. And, besides, the king
BELARIUS:
Hath not deserved my service nor your loves,
BELARIUS:
Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
BELARIUS:
The certainty of this hard life, aye hopeless
BELARIUS:
To have the courtesy your cradle promised,
BELARIUS:
But to be still hot summer's tamings and
BELARIUS:
The shrinking slaves of winter.
GUIDERIUS:
Than be so
GUIDERIUS:
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army
GUIDERIUS:
I and my brother are not known, yourself
GUIDERIUS:
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
GUIDERIUS:
Cannot be question'd.
ARVIRAGUS:
By this sun that shines,
ARVIRAGUS:
I'll thither: what thing is it that I never
ARVIRAGUS:
Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,
ARVIRAGUS:
But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
ARVIRAGUS:
Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
ARVIRAGUS:
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
ARVIRAGUS:
Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
ARVIRAGUS:
To look upon the holy sun, to have
ARVIRAGUS:
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
ARVIRAGUS:
So long a poor unknown.
GUIDERIUS:
By heavens, I'll go
GUIDERIUS:
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
GUIDERIUS:
I'll take the better care, but if you will not,
GUIDERIUS:
The hazard therefore due fall on me by
GUIDERIUS:
The hands of Romans!
ARVIRAGUS:
So say I	amen.
BELARIUS:
No reason I, since of your lives you set
BELARIUS:
So slight a valuation, should reserve
BELARIUS:
My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!
BELARIUS:
If in your country wars you chance to die,
BELARIUS:
That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie
BELARIUS:
Lead, lead.
BELARIUS:
Aside
BELARIUS:
The time seems long, their blood
BELARIUS:
thinks scorn,
BELARIUS:
Till it fly out and show them princes born.
BELARIUS:
Exeunt
BELARIUS:
ACT V
BELARIUS:
SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.
BELARIUS:
Enter POSTHUMUS, with a bloody handkerchief
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
If each of you should take this course, how many
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Must murder wives much better than themselves
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Every good servant does not all commands
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
You snatch some hence for little faults, that's love,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To have them fall no more: you some permit
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress, peace!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Against the part I come with, so I'll die
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Is every breath a death, and thus, unknown,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
More valour in me than my habits show.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The fashion, less without and more within.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Exit
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and  the Roman Army: from the other side, the  British Army, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following,  like a poor soldier. They march over and go  out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO  and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him
IACHIMO:
The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
IACHIMO:
Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,
IACHIMO:
The princess of this country, and the air on't
IACHIMO:
Revengingly enfeebles me, or could this carl,
IACHIMO:
A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me
IACHIMO:
In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne
IACHIMO:
As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.
IACHIMO:
If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
IACHIMO:
This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
IACHIMO:
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.
IACHIMO:
Exit
IACHIMO:
The battle continues, the Britons fly, CYMBELINE is  taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS
BELARIUS:
Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground,
BELARIUS:
The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but
BELARIUS:
The villany of our fears.
ARVIRAGUS:
Stand, stand, and fight!
ARVIRAGUS:
Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the  Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
CAIUS LUCIUS:
As war were hoodwink'd.
IACHIMO:
'Tis their fresh supplies.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Let's reinforce, or fly.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Exeunt
CAIUS LUCIUS:
SCENE III. Another part of the field.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord
Lord:
Camest thou from where they made the stand?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I did.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.
Lord:
I did.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
But that the heavens fought: the king himself
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Through a straight lane, the enemy full-hearted,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Merely through fear, that the straight pass was damm'd
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To die with lengthen'd shame.
Lord:
Where was this lane?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
An honest one, I warrant, who deserved
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
He, with two striplings-lads more like to run
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The country base than to commit such slaughter
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Than those for preservation cased, or shame--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Made good the passage, cried to those that fled,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Or we are Romans and will give you that
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
These three,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Three thousand confident, in act as many--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
For three performers are the file when all
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Accommodated by the place, more charming
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Part shame, part spirit renew'd, that some,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
turn'd coward
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
But by example--O, a sin in war,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The way that they did, and to grin like lions
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
A rout, confusion thick, forthwith they fly
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles, slaves,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Like fragments in hard voyages, became
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Some slain before, some dying, some their friends
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Those that would die or ere resist are grown
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The mortal bugs o' the field.
Lord:
This was strange chance
Lord:
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Rather to wonder at the things you hear
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And vent it for a mockery? Here is one
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'
Lord:
Nay, be not angry, sir.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
'Lack, to what end?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
For if he'll do as he is made to do,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
You have put me into rhyme.
Lord:
Farewell, you're angry.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Still going?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Exit Lord
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
This is a lord! O noble misery,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To-day how many would have given their honours
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Sweet words, or hath more ministers than we
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
For being now a favourer to the Briton,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
No more a Briton, I have resumed again
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The part I came in: fight I will no more,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Here made by the Roman, great the answer be
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
On either side I come to spend my breath,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
But end it by some means for Imogen.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Enter two British Captains and Soldiers
First Captain:
Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.
First Captain:
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
Second Captain:
There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,
Second Captain:
That gave the affront with them.
First Captain:
So 'tis reported
First Captain:
But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
A Roman,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Had answer'd him.
Second Captain:
Lay hands on him, a dog!
Second Captain:
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
Second Captain:
What crows have peck'd them here. He brags
Second Captain:
his service
Second Captain:
As if he were of note: bring him to the king.
Second Captain:
Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,  PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives.  The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to  CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnes
Second Captain:
SCENE IV. A British prison.
Second Captain:
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers
First Gaoler:
You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you,
First Gaoler:
So graze as you find pasture.
Second Gaoler:
Ay, or a stomach.
Second Gaoler:
Exeunt Gaolers
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
think, to liberty: yet am I better
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Than one that's sick o' the gout, since he had rather
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
By the sure physician, death, who is the key
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
So children temporal fathers do appease,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I cannot do it better than in gyves,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
No stricter render of me than my all.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I know you are more clement than vile men,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Who of their broken debtors take a third,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
On their abatement: that's not my desire
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
For Imogen's dear life take mine, and though
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life, you coin'd it
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
If you will take this audit, take this life,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I'll speak to thee in silence.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Sleeps
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition,  SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus,  an old man, attired like a warrior, leading in  his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother  to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:  then, after other music, follow the two young  Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with  wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping
Sicilius Leonatus:
No more, thou thunder-master, show
Sicilius Leonatus:
Thy spite on mortal flies
Sicilius Leonatus:
With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
Sicilius Leonatus:
That thy adulteries
Sicilius Leonatus:
Rates and revenges.
Sicilius Leonatus:
Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
Sicilius Leonatus:
Whose face I never saw?
Sicilius Leonatus:
I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
Sicilius Leonatus:
Attending nature's law
Sicilius Leonatus:
Whose father then, as men report
Sicilius Leonatus:
Thou orphans' father art,
Sicilius Leonatus:
Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
Sicilius Leonatus:
From this earth-vexing smart.
Mother:
Lucina lent not me her aid,
Mother:
But took me in my throes,
Mother:
That from me was Posthumus ript,
Mother:
Came crying 'mongst his foes,
Mother:
A thing of pity!
Sicilius Leonatus:
Great nature, like his ancestry,
Sicilius Leonatus:
Moulded the stuff so fair,
Sicilius Leonatus:
That he deserved the praise o' the world,
Sicilius Leonatus:
As great Sicilius' heir.
First Brother:
When once he was mature for man,
First Brother:
In Britain where was he
First Brother:
That could stand up his parallel,
First Brother:
Or fruitful object be
First Brother:
In eye of Imogen, that best
First Brother:
Could deem his dignity?
Mother:
With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,
Mother:
To be exiled, and thrown
Mother:
From Leonati seat, and cast
Mother:
From her his dearest one,
Mother:
Sweet Imogen?
Sicilius Leonatus:
Why did you suffer Iachimo,
Sicilius Leonatus:
Slight thing of Italy,
Sicilius Leonatus:
To taint his nobler heart and brain
Sicilius Leonatus:
With needless jealosy,
Sicilius Leonatus:
And to become the geck and scorn
Sicilius Leonatus:
O' th' other's villany?
Second Brother:
For this from stiller seats we came,
Second Brother:
Our parents and us twain,
Second Brother:
That striking in our country's cause
Second Brother:
Fell bravely and were slain,
Second Brother:
Our fealty and Tenantius' right
Second Brother:
With honour to maintain.
First Brother:
Like hardiment Posthumus hath
First Brother:
To Cymbeline perform'd
First Brother:
Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
First Brother:
Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
First Brother:
The graces for his merits due,
First Brother:
Being all to dolours turn'd?
Sicilius Leonatus:
Thy crystal window ope, look out,
Sicilius Leonatus:
No longer exercise
Sicilius Leonatus:
Upon a valiant race thy harsh
Sicilius Leonatus:
And potent injuries.
Mother:
Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
Mother:
Take off his miseries.
Sicilius Leonatus:
Peep through thy marble mansion, help,
Sicilius Leonatus:
Or we poor ghosts will cry
Sicilius Leonatus:
To the shining synod of the rest
Sicilius Leonatus:
Against thy deity.
Second Brother:
Help, Jupiter, or we appeal,
Second Brother:
And from thy justice fly.
Second Brother:
Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting  upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The Apparitions fall on their knees
Jupiter:
No more, you petty spirits of region low,
Jupiter:
Offend our hearing, hush! How dare you ghosts
Jupiter:
Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,
Jupiter:
Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
Jupiter:
Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
Jupiter:
Upon your never-withering banks of flowers
Jupiter:
Be not with mortal accidents opprest,
Jupiter:
No care of yours it is, you know 'tis ours.
Jupiter:
Whom best I love I cross, to make my gift,
Jupiter:
The more delay'd, delighted. Be content,
Jupiter:
Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift
Jupiter:
His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
Jupiter:
Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in
Jupiter:
Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.
Jupiter:
He shall be lord of lady Imogen,
Jupiter:
And happier much by his affliction made.
Jupiter:
This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
Jupiter:
Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
Jupiter:
and so, away: no further with your din
Jupiter:
Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
Jupiter:
Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.
Jupiter:
Ascends
Sicilius Leonatus:
He came in thunder, his celestial breath
Sicilius Leonatus:
Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle
Sicilius Leonatus:
Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is
Sicilius Leonatus:
More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird
Sicilius Leonatus:
Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
Sicilius Leonatus:
As when his god is pleased.
All:
Thanks, Jupiter!
Sicilius Leonatus:
The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd
Sicilius Leonatus:
His radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,
Sicilius Leonatus:
Let us with care perform his great behest.
Sicilius Leonatus:
The Apparitions vanish
Posthumus Leonatus:
[Waking]  Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot
Posthumus Leonatus:
A father to me, and thou hast created
Posthumus Leonatus:
A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
Posthumus Leonatus:
Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born
Posthumus Leonatus:
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
Posthumus Leonatus:
On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
Posthumus Leonatus:
Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve
Posthumus Leonatus:
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
Posthumus Leonatus:
And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,
Posthumus Leonatus:
That have this golden chance and know not why.
Posthumus Leonatus:
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
Posthumus Leonatus:
Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
Posthumus Leonatus:
Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects
Posthumus Leonatus:
So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
Posthumus Leonatus:
As good as promise.
Posthumus Leonatus:
Reads
Posthumus Leonatus:
'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,
Posthumus Leonatus:
without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of
Posthumus Leonatus:
tender air, and when from a stately cedar shall be
Posthumus Leonatus:
lopped branches, which, being dead many years,
Posthumus Leonatus:
shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and
Posthumus Leonatus:
freshly grow, then shall Posthumus end his miseries,
Posthumus Leonatus:
Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'
Posthumus Leonatus:
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
Posthumus Leonatus:
Tongue and brain not, either both or nothing,
Posthumus Leonatus:
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
Posthumus Leonatus:
As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
Posthumus Leonatus:
The action of my life is like it, which
Posthumus Leonatus:
I'll keep, if but for sympathy.
Posthumus Leonatus:
Re-enter First Gaoler
First Gaoler:
Come, sir, are you ready for death?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Over-roasted rather, ready long ago.
First Gaoler:
Hanging is the word, sir: if
First Gaoler:
you be ready for that, you are well cooked.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
So, if I prove a good repast to the
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
spectators, the dish pays the shot.
First Gaoler:
A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,
First Gaoler:
you shall be called to no more payments, fear no
First Gaoler:
more tavern-bills, which are often the sadness of
First Gaoler:
parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in
First Gaoler:
flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too
First Gaoler:
much drink, sorry that you have paid too much, and
First Gaoler:
sorry that you are paid too much, purse and brain
First Gaoler:
both empty, the brain the heavier for being too
First Gaoler:
light, the purse too light, being drawn of
First Gaoler:
heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be
First Gaoler:
quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up
First Gaoler:
thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and
First Gaoler:
creditor but it, of what's past, is, and to come,
First Gaoler:
the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and
First Gaoler:
counters, so the acquittance follows.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
First Gaoler:
Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the
First Gaoler:
tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
First Gaoler:
sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he
First Gaoler:
would change places with his officer, for, look you,
First Gaoler:
sir, you know not which way you shall go.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Yes, indeed do I, fellow.
First Gaoler:
Your death has eyes in 's head then, I have not seen
First Gaoler:
him so pictured: you must either be directed by
First Gaoler:
some that take upon them to know, or do take upon
First Gaoler:
yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or
First Gaoler:
jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how
First Gaoler:
you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll
First Gaoler:
never return to tell one.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
will not use them.
First Gaoler:
What an infinite mock is this, that a man should
First Gaoler:
have the best use of eyes to see the way of
First Gaoler:
blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.
First Gaoler:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Knock off his manacles, bring your prisoner to the king.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Thou bring'st good news, I am called to be made free.
First Gaoler:
I'll be hang'd then.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler, no bolts for the dead.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger
First Gaoler:
Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
First Gaoler:
gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my
First Gaoler:
conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,
First Gaoler:
for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them
First Gaoler:
too that die against their wills, so should I, if I
First Gaoler:
were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one
First Gaoler:
mind good, O, there were desolation of gaolers and
First Gaoler:
gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but
First Gaoler:
my wish hath a preferment in 't.
First Gaoler:
Exeunt
First Gaoler:
SCENE V. Cymbeline's tent.
First Gaoler:
Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, Lords, Officers, and Attendants
CYMBELINE:
Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
CYMBELINE:
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
CYMBELINE:
That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
CYMBELINE:
Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast
CYMBELINE:
Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found
CYMBELINE:
He shall be happy that can find him, if
CYMBELINE:
Our grace can make him so.
BELARIUS:
I never saw
BELARIUS:
Such noble fury in so poor a thing,
BELARIUS:
Such precious deeds in one that promises nought
BELARIUS:
But beggary and poor looks.
CYMBELINE:
No tidings of him?
PISANIO:
He hath been search'd among the dead and living,
PISANIO:
But no trace of him.
CYMBELINE:
To my grief, I am
CYMBELINE:
The heir of his reward,
CYMBELINE:
To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS
CYMBELINE:
which I will add
CYMBELINE:
To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,
CYMBELINE:
By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
CYMBELINE:
To ask of whence you are. Report it.
BELARIUS:
Sir,
BELARIUS:
In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen
BELARIUS:
Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
BELARIUS:
Unless I add, we are honest.
CYMBELINE:
Bow your knees.
CYMBELINE:
Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you
CYMBELINE:
Companions to our person and will fit you
CYMBELINE:
With dignities becoming your estates.
CYMBELINE:
Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies
CYMBELINE:
There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
CYMBELINE:
Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,
CYMBELINE:
And not o' the court of Britain.
CORNELIUS:
Hail, great king!
CORNELIUS:
To sour your happiness, I must report
CORNELIUS:
The queen is dead.
CYMBELINE:
Who worse than a physician
CYMBELINE:
Would this report become? But I consider,
CYMBELINE:
By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death
CYMBELINE:
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?
CORNELIUS:
With horror, madly dying, like her life,
CORNELIUS:
Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
CORNELIUS:
Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
CORNELIUS:
I will report, so please you: these her women
CORNELIUS:
Can trip me, if I err, who with wet cheeks
CORNELIUS:
Were present when she finish'd.
CYMBELINE:
Prithee, say.
CORNELIUS:
First, she confess'd she never loved you, only
CORNELIUS:
Affected greatness got by you, not you
CORNELIUS:
Married your royalty, was wife to your place,
CORNELIUS:
Abhorr'd your person.
CYMBELINE:
She alone knew this,
CYMBELINE:
And, but she spoke it dying, I would not
CYMBELINE:
Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
CORNELIUS:
Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
CORNELIUS:
With such integrity, she did confess
CORNELIUS:
Was as a scorpion to her sight, whose life,
CORNELIUS:
But that her flight prevented it, she had
CORNELIUS:
Ta'en off by poison.
CYMBELINE:
O most delicate fiend!
CYMBELINE:
Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?
CORNELIUS:
More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
CORNELIUS:
For you a mortal mineral, which, being took,
CORNELIUS:
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
CORNELIUS:
By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,
CORNELIUS:
By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
CORNELIUS:
O'ercome you with her show, and in time,
CORNELIUS:
When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
CORNELIUS:
Her son into the adoption of the crown
CORNELIUS:
But, failing of her end by his strange absence,
CORNELIUS:
Grew shameless-desperate, open'd, in despite
CORNELIUS:
Of heaven and men, her purposes, repented
CORNELIUS:
The evils she hatch'd were not effected, so
CORNELIUS:
Despairing died.
CYMBELINE:
Heard you all this, her women?
First Lady:
We did, so please your highness.
CYMBELINE:
Mine eyes
CYMBELINE:
Were not in fault, for she was beautiful,
CYMBELINE:
Mine ears, that heard her flattery, nor my heart,
CYMBELINE:
That thought her like her seeming, it had
CYMBELINE:
been vicious
CYMBELINE:
To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!
CYMBELINE:
That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
CYMBELINE:
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!
CYMBELINE:
Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other  Roman Prisoners, guarded, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind, and IMOGEN
CYMBELINE:
Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that
CYMBELINE:
The Britons have razed out, though with the loss
CYMBELINE:
Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit
CYMBELINE:
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
CYMBELINE:
Of you their captives, which ourself have granted
CYMBELINE:
So think of your estate.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Was yours by accident, had it gone with us,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
We should not, when the blood was cool,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
have threaten'd
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
CAIUS LUCIUS:
May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth
CAIUS LUCIUS:
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Augustus lives to think on't: and so much
CAIUS LUCIUS:
For my peculiar care. This one thing only
CAIUS LUCIUS:
I will entreat, my boy, a Briton born,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Let him be ransom'd: never master had
CAIUS LUCIUS:
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
So tender over his occasions, true,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join
CAIUS LUCIUS:
With my request, which I make bold your highness
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Cannot deny, he hath done no Briton harm,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
And spare no blood beside.
CYMBELINE:
I have surely seen him
CYMBELINE:
His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
CYMBELINE:
Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
CYMBELINE:
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
CYMBELINE:
To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master, live
CYMBELINE:
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
CYMBELINE:
Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it,
CYMBELINE:
Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
CYMBELINE:
The noblest ta'en.
IMOGEN:
I humbly thank your highness.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
And yet I know thou wilt.
IMOGEN:
No, no: alack,
IMOGEN:
There's other work in hand: I see a thing
IMOGEN:
Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,
IMOGEN:
Must shuffle for itself.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
The boy disdains me,
CAIUS LUCIUS:
He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
CAIUS LUCIUS:
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Why stands he so perplex'd?
CYMBELINE:
What wouldst thou, boy?
CYMBELINE:
I love thee more and more: think more and more
CYMBELINE:
What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,
CYMBELINE:
Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?
IMOGEN:
He is a Roman, no more kin to me
IMOGEN:
Than I to your highness, who, being born your vassal,
IMOGEN:
Am something nearer.
CYMBELINE:
Wherefore eyest him so?
IMOGEN:
I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
IMOGEN:
To give me hearing.
CYMBELINE:
Ay, with all my heart,
CYMBELINE:
And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
IMOGEN:
Fidele, sir.
CYMBELINE:
Thou'rt my good youth, my page,
CYMBELINE:
I'll be thy master: walk with me, speak freely.
CYMBELINE:
CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart
BELARIUS:
Is not this boy revived from death?
ARVIRAGUS:
One sand another
ARVIRAGUS:
Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
ARVIRAGUS:
Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?
GUIDERIUS:
The same dead thing alive.
BELARIUS:
Peace, peace! see further, he eyes us not, forbear,
BELARIUS:
Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure
BELARIUS:
He would have spoke to us.
GUIDERIUS:
But we saw him dead.
BELARIUS:
Be silent, let's see further.
PISANIO:
[Aside]	It is my mistress
PISANIO:
Since she is living, let the time run on
PISANIO:
To good or bad.
PISANIO:
CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward
CYMBELINE:
Come, stand thou by our side,
CYMBELINE:
Make thy demand aloud.
CYMBELINE:
To IACHIMO
CYMBELINE:
Sir, step you forth,
CYMBELINE:
Give answer to this boy, and do it freely,
CYMBELINE:
Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
CYMBELINE:
Which is our honour, bitter torture shall
CYMBELINE:
Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.
IMOGEN:
My boon is, that this gentleman may render
IMOGEN:
Of whom he had this ring.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
[Aside]                 What's that to him?
CYMBELINE:
That diamond upon your finger, say
CYMBELINE:
How came it yours?
IACHIMO:
Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
IACHIMO:
Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.
CYMBELINE:
How! me?
IACHIMO:
I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
IACHIMO:
Which torments me to conceal. By villany
IACHIMO:
I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel,
IACHIMO:
Whom thou didst banish, and--which more may
IACHIMO:
grieve thee,
IACHIMO:
As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived
IACHIMO:
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
CYMBELINE:
All that belongs to this.
IACHIMO:
That paragon, thy daughter,--
IACHIMO:
For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
IACHIMO:
Quail to remember--Give me leave, I faint.
CYMBELINE:
My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength
CYMBELINE:
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
CYMBELINE:
Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.
IACHIMO:
Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
IACHIMO:
That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed
IACHIMO:
The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would
IACHIMO:
Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
IACHIMO:
Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--
IACHIMO:
What should I say? he was too good to be
IACHIMO:
Where ill men were, and was the best of all
IACHIMO:
Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,
IACHIMO:
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
IACHIMO:
For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
IACHIMO:
Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming
IACHIMO:
The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.
IACHIMO:
Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,
IACHIMO:
A shop of all the qualities that man
IACHIMO:
Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
IACHIMO:
Fairness which strikes the eye--
CYMBELINE:
I stand on fire
CYMBELINE:
Come to the matter.
IACHIMO:
All too soon I shall,
IACHIMO:
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
IACHIMO:
Most like a noble lord in love and one
IACHIMO:
That had a royal lover, took his hint,
IACHIMO:
And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein
IACHIMO:
He was as calm as virtue--he began
IACHIMO:
His mistress' picture, which by his tongue
IACHIMO:
being made,
IACHIMO:
And then a mind put in't, either our brags
IACHIMO:
Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description
IACHIMO:
Proved us unspeaking sots.
CYMBELINE:
Nay, nay, to the purpose.
IACHIMO:
Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
IACHIMO:
He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
IACHIMO:
And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,
IACHIMO:
Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him
IACHIMO:
Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
IACHIMO:
Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
IACHIMO:
In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
IACHIMO:
By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
IACHIMO:
No lesser of her honour confident
IACHIMO:
Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring,
IACHIMO:
And would so, had it been a carbuncle
IACHIMO:
Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
IACHIMO:
Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
IACHIMO:
Post I in this design: well may you, sir,
IACHIMO:
Remember me at court, where I was taught
IACHIMO:
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
IACHIMO:
'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd
IACHIMO:
Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
IACHIMO:
'Gan in your duller Britain operate
IACHIMO:
Most vilely, for my vantage, excellent
IACHIMO:
And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,
IACHIMO:
That I return'd with simular proof enough
IACHIMO:
To make the noble Leonatus mad,
IACHIMO:
By wounding his belief in her renown
IACHIMO:
With tokens thus, and thus, averting notes
IACHIMO:
Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--
IACHIMO:
O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
IACHIMO:
Of secret on her person, that he could not
IACHIMO:
But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
IACHIMO:
I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--
IACHIMO:
Methinks, I see him now--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
[Advancing]             Ay, so thou dost,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That's due to all the villains past, in being,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
For torturers ingenious: it is I
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
That caused a lesser villain than myself,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Of virtue was she, yea, and she herself.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Spit, and throw stone s, cast mire upon me, set
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus, and
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Imogen, Imogen!
IMOGEN:
Peace, my lord, hear, hear--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
There lie thy part.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Striking her: she falls
PISANIO:
O, gentlemen, help!
PISANIO:
Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!
PISANIO:
You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!
PISANIO:
Mine honour'd lady!
CYMBELINE:
Does the world go round?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
How come these staggers on me?
PISANIO:
Wake, my mistress!
CYMBELINE:
If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
CYMBELINE:
To death with mortal joy.
PISANIO:
How fares thy mistress?
IMOGEN:
O, get thee from my sight,
IMOGEN:
Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!
IMOGEN:
Breathe not where princes are.
CYMBELINE:
The tune of Imogen!
PISANIO:
Lady,
PISANIO:
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
PISANIO:
That box I gave you was not thought by me
PISANIO:
A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
CYMBELINE:
New matter still?
IMOGEN:
It poison'd me.
CORNELIUS:
O gods!
CORNELIUS:
I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.
CORNELIUS:
Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
CORNELIUS:
Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection
CORNELIUS:
Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
CORNELIUS:
As I would serve a rat.'
CYMBELINE:
What's this, Comelius?
CORNELIUS:
The queen, sir, very oft importuned me
CORNELIUS:
To temper poisons for her, still pretending
CORNELIUS:
The satisfaction of her knowledge only
CORNELIUS:
In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
CORNELIUS:
Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose
CORNELIUS:
Was of more danger, did compound for her
CORNELIUS:
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
CORNELIUS:
The present power of life, but in short time
CORNELIUS:
All offices of nature should again
CORNELIUS:
Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
IMOGEN:
Most like I did, for I was dead.
BELARIUS:
My boys,
BELARIUS:
There was our error.
GUIDERIUS:
This is, sure, Fidele.
IMOGEN:
Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
IMOGEN:
Think that you are upon a rock, and now
IMOGEN:
Throw me again.
IMOGEN:
Embracing him
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Hang there like a fruit, my soul,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Till the tree die!
CYMBELINE:
How now, my flesh, my child!
CYMBELINE:
What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?
CYMBELINE:
Wilt thou not speak to me?
IMOGEN:
[Kneeling]               Your blessing, sir.
BELARIUS:
[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]  Though you did love
BELARIUS:
this youth, I blame ye not
BELARIUS:
You had a motive for't.
CYMBELINE:
My tears that fall
CYMBELINE:
Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
CYMBELINE:
Thy mother's dead.
IMOGEN:
I am sorry for't, my lord.
CYMBELINE:
O, she was nought, and long of her it was
CYMBELINE:
That we meet here so strangely: but her son
CYMBELINE:
Is gone, we know not how nor where.
PISANIO:
My lord,
PISANIO:
Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
PISANIO:
Upon my lady's missing, came to me
PISANIO:
With his sword drawn, foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
PISANIO:
If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
PISANIO:
It was my instant death. By accident,
PISANIO:
had a feigned letter of my master's
PISANIO:
Then in my pocket, which directed him
PISANIO:
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford,
PISANIO:
Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
PISANIO:
Which he enforced from me, away he posts
PISANIO:
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
PISANIO:
My lady's honour: what became of him
PISANIO:
I further know not.
GUIDERIUS:
Let me end the story
GUIDERIUS:
I slew him there.
CYMBELINE:
Marry, the gods forfend!
CYMBELINE:
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
CYMBELINE:
Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,
CYMBELINE:
Deny't again.
GUIDERIUS:
I have spoke it, and I did it.
CYMBELINE:
He was a prince.
GUIDERIUS:
A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
GUIDERIUS:
Were nothing prince-like, for he did provoke me
GUIDERIUS:
With language that would make me spurn the sea,
GUIDERIUS:
If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head,
GUIDERIUS:
And am right glad he is not standing here
GUIDERIUS:
To tell this tale of mine.
CYMBELINE:
I am sorry for thee
CYMBELINE:
By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
CYMBELINE:
Endure our law: thou'rt dead.
IMOGEN:
That headless man
IMOGEN:
I thought had been my lord.
CYMBELINE:
Bind the offender,
CYMBELINE:
And take him from our presence.
BELARIUS:
Stay, sir king
BELARIUS:
This man is better than the man he slew,
BELARIUS:
As well descended as thyself, and hath
BELARIUS:
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
BELARIUS:
Had ever scar for.
BELARIUS:
To the Guard
BELARIUS:
Let his arms alone,
BELARIUS:
They were not born for bondage.
CYMBELINE:
Why, old soldier,
CYMBELINE:
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
CYMBELINE:
By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
CYMBELINE:
As good as we?
ARVIRAGUS:
In that he spake too far.
CYMBELINE:
And thou shalt die for't.
BELARIUS:
We will die all three
BELARIUS:
But I will prove that two on's are as good
BELARIUS:
As I have given out him. My sons, I must,
BELARIUS:
For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,
BELARIUS:
Though, haply, well for you.
ARVIRAGUS:
Your danger's ours.
GUIDERIUS:
And our good his.
BELARIUS:
Have at it then, by leave.
BELARIUS:
Thou hadst, great king, a subject who
BELARIUS:
Was call'd Belarius.
CYMBELINE:
What of him? he is
CYMBELINE:
A banish'd traitor.
BELARIUS:
He it is that hath
BELARIUS:
Assumed this age, indeed a banish'd man,
BELARIUS:
I know not how a traitor.
CYMBELINE:
Take him hence
CYMBELINE:
The whole world shall not save him.
BELARIUS:
Not too hot
BELARIUS:
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,
BELARIUS:
And let it be confiscate all, so soon
BELARIUS:
As I have received it.
CYMBELINE:
Nursing of my sons!
BELARIUS:
I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee
BELARIUS:
Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons,
BELARIUS:
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
BELARIUS:
These two young gentlemen, that call me father
BELARIUS:
And think they are my sons, are none of mine,
BELARIUS:
They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
BELARIUS:
And blood of your begetting.
CYMBELINE:
How! my issue!
BELARIUS:
So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
BELARIUS:
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd
BELARIUS:
Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
BELARIUS:
Itself, and all my treason, that I suffer'd
BELARIUS:
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
BELARIUS:
For such and so they are--these twenty years
BELARIUS:
Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
BELARIUS:
Could put into them, my breeding was, sir, as
BELARIUS:
Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
BELARIUS:
Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
BELARIUS:
Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,
BELARIUS:
Having received the punishment before,
BELARIUS:
For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty
BELARIUS:
Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
BELARIUS:
The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
BELARIUS:
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
BELARIUS:
Here are your sons again, and I must lose
BELARIUS:
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
BELARIUS:
The benediction of these covering heavens
BELARIUS:
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
BELARIUS:
To inlay heaven with stars.
CYMBELINE:
Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
CYMBELINE:
The service that you three have done is more
CYMBELINE:
Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children
CYMBELINE:
If these be they, I know not how to wish
CYMBELINE:
A pair of worthier sons.
BELARIUS:
Be pleased awhile.
BELARIUS:
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
BELARIUS:
Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius
BELARIUS:
This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
BELARIUS:
Your younger princely son, he, sir, was lapp'd
BELARIUS:
In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
BELARIUS:
Of his queen mother, which for more probation
BELARIUS:
I can with ease produce.
CYMBELINE:
Guiderius had
CYMBELINE:
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star,
CYMBELINE:
It was a mark of wonder.
BELARIUS:
This is he,
BELARIUS:
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp
BELARIUS:
It was wise nature's end in the donation,
BELARIUS:
To be his evidence now.
CYMBELINE:
O, what, am I
CYMBELINE:
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
CYMBELINE:
Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
CYMBELINE:
That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
CYMBELINE:
may reign in them now! O Imogen,
CYMBELINE:
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.
IMOGEN:
No, my lord,
IMOGEN:
I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,
IMOGEN:
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
IMOGEN:
But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,
IMOGEN:
When I was but your sister, I you brothers,
IMOGEN:
When ye were so indeed.
CYMBELINE:
Did you e'er meet?
ARVIRAGUS:
Ay, my good lord.
GUIDERIUS:
And at first meeting loved,
GUIDERIUS:
Continued so, until we thought he died.
CORNELIUS:
By the queen's dram she swallow'd.
CYMBELINE:
O rare instinct!
CYMBELINE:
When shall I hear all through? This fierce
CYMBELINE:
abridgement
CYMBELINE:
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
CYMBELINE:
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?
CYMBELINE:
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
CYMBELINE:
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
CYMBELINE:
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
CYMBELINE:
And your three motives to the battle, with
CYMBELINE:
I know not how much more, should be demanded,
CYMBELINE:
And all the other by-dependencies,
CYMBELINE:
From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place
CYMBELINE:
Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,
CYMBELINE:
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
CYMBELINE:
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
CYMBELINE:
On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting
CYMBELINE:
Each object with a joy: the counterchange
CYMBELINE:
Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
CYMBELINE:
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
CYMBELINE:
To BELARIUS
CYMBELINE:
Thou art my brother, so we'll hold thee ever.
IMOGEN:
You are my father too, and did relieve me,
IMOGEN:
To see this gracious season.
CYMBELINE:
All o'erjoy'd,
CYMBELINE:
Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,
CYMBELINE:
For they shall taste our comfort.
IMOGEN:
My good master,
IMOGEN:
I will yet do you service.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Happy be you!
CYMBELINE:
The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
CYMBELINE:
He would have well becomed this place, and graced
CYMBELINE:
The thankings of a king.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
I am, sir,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The soldier that did company these three
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
In poor beseeming, 'twas a fitment for
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Have made you finish.
IACHIMO:
[Kneeling]          I am down again
IACHIMO:
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
IACHIMO:
As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
IACHIMO:
Which I so often owe: but your ring first,
IACHIMO:
And here the bracelet of the truest princess
IACHIMO:
That ever swore her faith.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Kneel not to me
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The power that I have on you is, to spare you,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
The malice towards you to forgive you: live,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
And deal with others better.
CYMBELINE:
Nobly doom'd!
CYMBELINE:
We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law,
CYMBELINE:
Pardon's the word to all.
ARVIRAGUS:
You holp us, sir,
ARVIRAGUS:
As you did mean indeed to be our brother,
ARVIRAGUS:
Joy'd are we that you are.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
This label on my bosom, whose containing
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
Make no collection of it: let him show
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS:
His skill in the construction.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Philarmonus!
Soothsayer:
Here, my good lord.
CAIUS LUCIUS:
Read, and declare the meaning.
Soothsayer:
[Reads]  'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself
Soothsayer:
unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a
Soothsayer:
piece of tender air, and when from a stately cedar
Soothsayer:
shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many
Soothsayer:
years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
Soothsayer:
stock, and freshly grow, then shall Posthumus end
Soothsayer:
his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in
Soothsayer:
peace and plenty.'
Soothsayer:
Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp,
Soothsayer:
The fit and apt construction of thy name,
Soothsayer:
Being Leonatus, doth import so much.
Soothsayer:
To CYMBELINE
Soothsayer:
The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
Soothsayer:
Which we call 'mollis aer,' and 'mollis aer'
Soothsayer:
We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine
Soothsayer:
Is this most constant wife, who, even now,
Soothsayer:
Answering the letter of the oracle,
Soothsayer:
Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
Soothsayer:
With this most tender air.
CYMBELINE:
This hath some seeming.
Soothsayer:
The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
Soothsayer:
Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point
Soothsayer:
Thy two sons forth, who, by Belarius stol'n,
Soothsayer:
For many years thought dead, are now revived,
Soothsayer:
To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
Soothsayer:
Promises Britain peace and plenty.
CYMBELINE:
Well
CYMBELINE:
My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
CYMBELINE:
Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
CYMBELINE:
And to the Roman empire, promising
CYMBELINE:
To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
CYMBELINE:
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen,
CYMBELINE:
Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
CYMBELINE:
Have laid most heavy hand.
Soothsayer:
The fingers of the powers above do tune
Soothsayer:
The harmony of this peace. The vision
Soothsayer:
Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
Soothsayer:
Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
Soothsayer:
Is full accomplish'd, for the Roman eagle,
Soothsayer:
From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
Soothsayer:
Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
Soothsayer:
So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
Soothsayer:
The imperial Caesar, should again unite
Soothsayer:
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
Soothsayer:
Which shines here in the west.
CYMBELINE:
Laud we the gods,
CYMBELINE:
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
CYMBELINE:
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
CYMBELINE:
To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
CYMBELINE:
A Roman and a British ensign wave
CYMBELINE:
Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march
CYMBELINE:
And in the temple of great Jupiter
CYMBELINE:
Our peace we'll ratify, seal it with feasts.
CYMBELINE:
Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
CYMBELINE:
Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
CYMBELINE:
Exeunt
