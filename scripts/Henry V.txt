PRINCE FORTINBRAS:
Enter Chorus
Chorus:
O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
Chorus:
The brightest heaven of invention,
Chorus:
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
Chorus:
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
Chorus:
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Chorus:
Assume the port of Mars, and at his heels,
Chorus:
Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire
Chorus:
Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,
Chorus:
The flat unraised spirits that have dared
Chorus:
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
Chorus:
So great an object: can this cockpit hold
Chorus:
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
Chorus:
Within this wooden O the very casques
Chorus:
That did affright the air at Agincourt?
Chorus:
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
Chorus:
Attest in little place a million,
Chorus:
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
Chorus:
On your imaginary forces work.
Chorus:
Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Chorus:
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
Chorus:
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
Chorus:
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder
Chorus:
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts,
Chorus:
Into a thousand parts divide on man,
Chorus:
And make imaginary puissance,
Chorus:
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them
Chorus:
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth,
Chorus:
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
Chorus:
Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,
Chorus:
Turning the accomplishment of many years
Chorus:
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
Chorus:
Admit me Chorus to this history,
Chorus:
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,
Chorus:
Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.
Chorus:
Exit
Chorus:
SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.
Chorus:
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY
CANTERBURY:
My lord, I'll tell you, that self bill is urged,
CANTERBURY:
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
CANTERBURY:
Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
CANTERBURY:
But that the scambling and unquiet time
CANTERBURY:
Did push it out of farther question.
ELY:
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
CANTERBURY:
It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
CANTERBURY:
We lose the better half of our possession
CANTERBURY:
For all the temporal lands which men devout
CANTERBURY:
By testament have given to the church
CANTERBURY:
Would they strip from us, being valued thus
CANTERBURY:
As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
CANTERBURY:
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
CANTERBURY:
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires,
CANTERBURY:
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
CANTERBURY:
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
CANTERBURY:
A hundred almshouses right well supplied,
CANTERBURY:
And to the coffers of the king beside,
CANTERBURY:
A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.
ELY:
This would drink deep.
CANTERBURY:
'Twould drink the cup and all.
ELY:
But what prevention?
CANTERBURY:
The king is full of grace and fair regard.
ELY:
And a true lover of the holy church.
CANTERBURY:
The courses of his youth promised it not.
CANTERBURY:
The breath no sooner left his father's body,
CANTERBURY:
But that his wildness, mortified in him,
CANTERBURY:
Seem'd to die too, yea, at that very moment
CANTERBURY:
Consideration, like an angel, came
CANTERBURY:
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
CANTERBURY:
Leaving his body as a paradise,
CANTERBURY:
To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
CANTERBURY:
Never was such a sudden scholar made,
CANTERBURY:
Never came reformation in a flood,
CANTERBURY:
With such a heady currance, scouring faults
CANTERBURY:
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
CANTERBURY:
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
CANTERBURY:
As in this king.
ELY:
We are blessed in the change.
CANTERBURY:
Hear him but reason in divinity,
CANTERBURY:
And all-admiring with an inward wish
CANTERBURY:
You would desire the king were made a prelate
CANTERBURY:
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
CANTERBURY:
You would say it hath been all in all his study
CANTERBURY:
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
CANTERBURY:
A fearful battle render'd you in music
CANTERBURY:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
CANTERBURY:
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
CANTERBURY:
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
CANTERBURY:
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
CANTERBURY:
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
CANTERBURY:
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences,
CANTERBURY:
So that the art and practic part of life
CANTERBURY:
Must be the mistress to this theoric
CANTERBURY:
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
CANTERBURY:
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
CANTERBURY:
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
CANTERBURY:
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
CANTERBURY:
And never noted in him any study,
CANTERBURY:
Any retirement, any sequestration
CANTERBURY:
From open haunts and popularity.
ELY:
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
ELY:
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
ELY:
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality
ELY:
And so the prince obscured his contemplation
ELY:
Under the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,
ELY:
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
ELY:
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.
CANTERBURY:
It must be so, for miracles are ceased,
CANTERBURY:
And therefore we must needs admit the means
CANTERBURY:
How things are perfected.
ELY:
But, my good lord,
ELY:
How now for mitigation of this bill
ELY:
Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
ELY:
Incline to it, or no?
CANTERBURY:
He seems indifferent,
CANTERBURY:
Or rather swaying more upon our part
CANTERBURY:
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us,
CANTERBURY:
For I have made an offer to his majesty,
CANTERBURY:
Upon our spiritual convocation
CANTERBURY:
And in regard of causes now in hand,
CANTERBURY:
Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
CANTERBURY:
As touching France, to give a greater sum
CANTERBURY:
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
CANTERBURY:
Did to his predecessors part withal.
ELY:
How did this offer seem received, my lord?
CANTERBURY:
With good acceptance of his majesty,
CANTERBURY:
Save that there was not time enough to hear,
CANTERBURY:
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
CANTERBURY:
The severals and unhidden passages
CANTERBURY:
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
CANTERBURY:
And generally to the crown and seat of France
CANTERBURY:
Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
ELY:
What was the impediment that broke this off?
CANTERBURY:
The French ambassador upon that instant
CANTERBURY:
Craved audience, and the hour, I think, is come
CANTERBURY:
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
ELY:
It is.
CANTERBURY:
Then go we in, to know his embassy,
CANTERBURY:
Which I could with a ready guess declare,
CANTERBURY:
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
ELY:
I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.
ELY:
Exeunt
ELY:
SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.
ELY:
Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants
KING HENRY V:
Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
EXETER:
Not here in presence.
KING HENRY V:
Send for him, good uncle.
WESTMORELAND:
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
KING HENRY V:
Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
KING HENRY V:
Before we hear him, of some things of weight
KING HENRY V:
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.
KING HENRY V:
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY
CANTERBURY:
God and his angels guard your sacred throne
CANTERBURY:
And make you long become it!
KING HENRY V:
Sure, we thank you.
KING HENRY V:
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
KING HENRY V:
And justly and religiously unfold
KING HENRY V:
Why the law Salique that they have in France
KING HENRY V:
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim
KING HENRY V:
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
KING HENRY V:
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
KING HENRY V:
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
KING HENRY V:
With opening titles miscreate, whose right
KING HENRY V:
Suits not in native colours with the truth,
KING HENRY V:
For God doth know how many now in health
KING HENRY V:
Shall drop their blood in approbation
KING HENRY V:
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
KING HENRY V:
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
KING HENRY V:
How you awake our sleeping sword of war
KING HENRY V:
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed,
KING HENRY V:
For never two such kingdoms did contend
KING HENRY V:
Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops
KING HENRY V:
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
KING HENRY V:
'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
KING HENRY V:
That make such waste in brief mortality.
KING HENRY V:
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord,
KING HENRY V:
For we will hear, note and believe in heart
KING HENRY V:
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
KING HENRY V:
As pure as sin with baptism.
CANTERBURY:
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
CANTERBURY:
That owe yourselves, your lives and services
CANTERBURY:
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
CANTERBURY:
To make against your highness' claim to France
CANTERBURY:
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
CANTERBURY:
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
CANTERBURY:
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
CANTERBURY:
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
CANTERBURY:
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
CANTERBURY:
The founder of this law and female bar.
CANTERBURY:
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
CANTERBURY:
That the land Salique is in Germany,
CANTERBURY:
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,
CANTERBURY:
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
CANTERBURY:
There left behind and settled certain French,
CANTERBURY:
Who, holding in disdain the German women
CANTERBURY:
For some dishonest manners of their life,
CANTERBURY:
Establish'd then this law, to wit, no female
CANTERBURY:
Should be inheritrix in Salique land
CANTERBURY:
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
CANTERBURY:
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
CANTERBURY:
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
CANTERBURY:
Was not devised for the realm of France
CANTERBURY:
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
CANTERBURY:
Until four hundred one and twenty years
CANTERBURY:
After defunction of King Pharamond,
CANTERBURY:
Idly supposed the founder of this law,
CANTERBURY:
Who died within the year of our redemption
CANTERBURY:
Four hundred twenty-six, and Charles the Great
CANTERBURY:
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
CANTERBURY:
Beyond the river Sala, in the year
CANTERBURY:
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
CANTERBURY:
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
CANTERBURY:
Did, as heir general, being descended
CANTERBURY:
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
CANTERBURY:
Make claim and title to the crown of France.
CANTERBURY:
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
CANTERBURY:
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
CANTERBURY:
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
CANTERBURY:
To find his title with some shows of truth,
CANTERBURY:
'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
CANTERBURY:
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
CANTERBURY:
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
CANTERBURY:
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
CANTERBURY:
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
CANTERBURY:
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
CANTERBURY:
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
CANTERBURY:
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
CANTERBURY:
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
CANTERBURY:
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
CANTERBURY:
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine
CANTERBURY:
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
CANTERBURY:
Was re-united to the crown of France.
CANTERBURY:
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
CANTERBURY:
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
CANTERBURY:
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
CANTERBURY:
To hold in right and title of the female
CANTERBURY:
So do the kings of France unto this day,
CANTERBURY:
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
CANTERBURY:
To bar your highness claiming from the female,
CANTERBURY:
And rather choose to hide them in a net
CANTERBURY:
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
CANTERBURY:
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
KING HENRY V:
May I with right and conscience make this claim?
CANTERBURY:
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
CANTERBURY:
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
CANTERBURY:
When the man dies, let the inheritance
CANTERBURY:
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
CANTERBURY:
Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,
CANTERBURY:
Look back into your mighty ancestors
CANTERBURY:
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
CANTERBURY:
From whom you claim, invoke his warlike spirit,
CANTERBURY:
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
CANTERBURY:
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
CANTERBURY:
Making defeat on the full power of France,
CANTERBURY:
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
CANTERBURY:
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
CANTERBURY:
Forage in blood of French nobility.
CANTERBURY:
O noble English. that could entertain
CANTERBURY:
With half their forces the full Pride of France
CANTERBURY:
And let another half stand laughing by,
CANTERBURY:
All out of work and cold for action!
ELY:
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
ELY:
And with your puissant arm renew their feats
ELY:
You are their heir, you sit upon their throne,
ELY:
The blood and courage that renowned them
ELY:
Runs in your veins, and my thrice-puissant liege
ELY:
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
ELY:
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
EXETER:
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
EXETER:
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
EXETER:
As did the former lions of your blood.
WESTMORELAND:
They know your grace hath cause and means and might,
WESTMORELAND:
So hath your highness, never king of England
WESTMORELAND:
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
WESTMORELAND:
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
WESTMORELAND:
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
CANTERBURY:
O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
CANTERBURY:
With blood and sword and fire to win your right,
CANTERBURY:
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
CANTERBURY:
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
CANTERBURY:
As never did the clergy at one time
CANTERBURY:
Bring in to any of your ancestors.
KING HENRY V:
We must not only arm to invade the French,
KING HENRY V:
But lay down our proportions to defend
KING HENRY V:
Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
KING HENRY V:
With all advantages.
CANTERBURY:
They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
CANTERBURY:
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
CANTERBURY:
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
KING HENRY V:
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
KING HENRY V:
But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
KING HENRY V:
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us,
KING HENRY V:
For you shall read that my great-grandfather
KING HENRY V:
Never went with his forces into France
KING HENRY V:
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
KING HENRY V:
Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
KING HENRY V:
With ample and brim fulness of his force,
KING HENRY V:
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
KING HENRY V:
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns,
KING HENRY V:
That England, being empty of defence,
KING HENRY V:
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.
CANTERBURY:
She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege,
CANTERBURY:
For hear her but exampled by herself
CANTERBURY:
When all her chivalry hath been in France
CANTERBURY:
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
CANTERBURY:
She hath herself not only well defended
CANTERBURY:
But taken and impounded as a stray
CANTERBURY:
The King of Scots, whom she did send to France,
CANTERBURY:
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
CANTERBURY:
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
CANTERBURY:
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
CANTERBURY:
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.
WESTMORELAND:
But there's a saying very old and true,
WESTMORELAND:
'If that you will France win,
WESTMORELAND:
Then with Scotland first begin:'
WESTMORELAND:
For once the eagle England being in prey,
WESTMORELAND:
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
WESTMORELAND:
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
WESTMORELAND:
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
WESTMORELAND:
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
EXETER:
It follows then the cat must stay at home
EXETER:
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
EXETER:
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
EXETER:
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
EXETER:
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
EXETER:
The advised head defends itself at home,
EXETER:
For government, though high and low and lower,
EXETER:
Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
EXETER:
Congreeing in a full and natural close,
EXETER:
Like music.
CANTERBURY:
Therefore doth heaven divide
CANTERBURY:
The state of man in divers functions,
CANTERBURY:
Setting endeavour in continual motion,
CANTERBURY:
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
CANTERBURY:
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
CANTERBURY:
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
CANTERBURY:
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
CANTERBURY:
They have a king and officers of sorts,
CANTERBURY:
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
CANTERBURY:
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
CANTERBURY:
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
CANTERBURY:
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
CANTERBURY:
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
CANTERBURY:
To the tent-royal of their emperor,
CANTERBURY:
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
CANTERBURY:
The singing masons building roofs of gold,
CANTERBURY:
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
CANTERBURY:
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
CANTERBURY:
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
CANTERBURY:
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
CANTERBURY:
Delivering o'er to executors pale
CANTERBURY:
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
CANTERBURY:
That many things, having full reference
CANTERBURY:
To one consent, may work contrariously
CANTERBURY:
As many arrows, loosed several ways,
CANTERBURY:
Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town,
CANTERBURY:
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea,
CANTERBURY:
As many lines close in the dial's centre,
CANTERBURY:
So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
CANTERBURY:
End in one purpose, and be all well borne
CANTERBURY:
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
CANTERBURY:
Divide your happy England into four,
CANTERBURY:
Whereof take you one quarter into France,
CANTERBURY:
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
CANTERBURY:
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
CANTERBURY:
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
CANTERBURY:
Let us be worried and our nation lose
CANTERBURY:
The name of hardiness and policy.
KING HENRY V:
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt some Attendants
KING HENRY V:
Now are we well resolved, and, by God's help,
KING HENRY V:
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
KING HENRY V:
France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
KING HENRY V:
Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,
KING HENRY V:
Ruling in large and ample empery
KING HENRY V:
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
KING HENRY V:
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
KING HENRY V:
Tombless, with no remembrance over them
KING HENRY V:
Either our history shall with full mouth
KING HENRY V:
Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
KING HENRY V:
Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,
KING HENRY V:
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.
KING HENRY V:
Enter Ambassadors of France
KING HENRY V:
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
KING HENRY V:
Of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear
KING HENRY V:
Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
First Ambassador:
May't please your majesty to give us leave
First Ambassador:
Freely to render what we have in charge,
First Ambassador:
Or shall we sparingly show you far off
First Ambassador:
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
KING HENRY V:
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,
KING HENRY V:
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
KING HENRY V:
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons
KING HENRY V:
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
KING HENRY V:
Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
First Ambassador:
Thus, then, in few.
First Ambassador:
Your highness, lately sending into France,
First Ambassador:
Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
First Ambassador:
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
First Ambassador:
In answer of which claim, the prince our master
First Ambassador:
Says that you savour too much of your youth,
First Ambassador:
And bids you be advised there's nought in France
First Ambassador:
That can be with a nimble galliard won,
First Ambassador:
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
First Ambassador:
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
First Ambassador:
This tun of treasure, and, in lieu of this,
First Ambassador:
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
First Ambassador:
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
KING HENRY V:
What treasure, uncle?
EXETER:
Tennis-balls, my liege.
KING HENRY V:
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us,
KING HENRY V:
His present and your pains we thank you for
KING HENRY V:
When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,
KING HENRY V:
We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
KING HENRY V:
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
KING HENRY V:
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
KING HENRY V:
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
KING HENRY V:
With chaces. And we understand him well,
KING HENRY V:
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
KING HENRY V:
Not measuring what use we made of them.
KING HENRY V:
We never valued this poor seat of England,
KING HENRY V:
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
KING HENRY V:
To barbarous licence, as 'tis ever common
KING HENRY V:
That men are merriest when they are from home.
KING HENRY V:
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
KING HENRY V:
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
KING HENRY V:
When I do rouse me in my throne of France
KING HENRY V:
For that I have laid by my majesty
KING HENRY V:
And plodded like a man for working-days,
KING HENRY V:
But I will rise there with so full a glory
KING HENRY V:
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
KING HENRY V:
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
KING HENRY V:
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
KING HENRY V:
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones, and his soul
KING HENRY V:
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
KING HENRY V:
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
KING HENRY V:
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands,
KING HENRY V:
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down,
KING HENRY V:
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
KING HENRY V:
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
KING HENRY V:
But this lies all within the will of God,
KING HENRY V:
To whom I do appeal, and in whose name
KING HENRY V:
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
KING HENRY V:
To venge me as I may and to put forth
KING HENRY V:
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
KING HENRY V:
So get you hence in peace, and tell the Dauphin
KING HENRY V:
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
KING HENRY V:
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
KING HENRY V:
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt Ambassadors
EXETER:
This was a merry message.
KING HENRY V:
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
KING HENRY V:
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
KING HENRY V:
That may give furtherance to our expedition,
KING HENRY V:
For we have now no thought in us but France,
KING HENRY V:
Save those to God, that run before our business.
KING HENRY V:
Therefore let our proportions for these wars
KING HENRY V:
Be soon collected and all things thought upon
KING HENRY V:
That may with reasonable swiftness add
KING HENRY V:
More feathers to our wings, for, God before,
KING HENRY V:
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
KING HENRY V:
Therefore let every man now task his thought,
KING HENRY V:
That this fair action may on foot be brought.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt. Flourish

Now all the youth of England are on fire,

Chorus:
Like little body with a mighty heart,
Chorus:
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
Chorus:
Were all thy children kind and natural!
Chorus:
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
Chorus:
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
Chorus:
With treacherous crowns, and three corrupted men,
Chorus:
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
Chorus:
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
Chorus:
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
Chorus:
Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!
Chorus:
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France,
Chorus:
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
Chorus:
If hell and treason hold their promises,
Chorus:
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.
Chorus:
Linger your patience on, and we'll digest
Chorus:
The abuse of distance, force a play
Chorus:
The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed,
Chorus:
The king is set from London, and the scene
Chorus:
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton,
Chorus:
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit
Chorus:
And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
Chorus:
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
Chorus:
To give you gentle pass, for, if we may,
Chorus:
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
Chorus:
But, till the king come forth, and not till then,
Chorus:
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.
Chorus:
Exit
Chorus:
SCENE I. London. A street.
Chorus:
Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH
BARDOLPH:
Well met, Corporal Nym.
NYM:
Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
BARDOLPH:
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
NYM:
For my part, I care not: I say little, but when
NYM:
time shall serve, there shall be smiles, but that
NYM:
shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I will
NYM:
wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one, but
NYM:
what though? it will toast cheese, and it will
NYM:
endure cold as another man's sword will: and
NYM:
there's an end.
BARDOLPH:
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends, and
BARDOLPH:
we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it
BARDOLPH:
be so, good Corporal Nym.
NYM:
Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the
NYM:
certain of it, and when I cannot live any longer, I
NYM:
will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the
NYM:
rendezvous of it.
BARDOLPH:
It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell
BARDOLPH:
Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong, for you
BARDOLPH:
were troth-plight to her.
NYM:
I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may
NYM:
sleep, and they may have their throats about them at
NYM:
that time, and some say knives have edges. It must
NYM:
be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet
NYM:
she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I
NYM:
cannot tell.
NYM:
Enter PISTOL and Hostess
BARDOLPH:
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good
BARDOLPH:
corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!
PISTOL:
Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,
PISTOL:
I swear, I scorn the term, Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.
Hostess:
No, by my troth, not long, for we cannot lodge and
Hostess:
board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live
Hostess:
honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will
Hostess:
be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.
Hostess:
NYM and PISTOL draw
Hostess:
O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we
Hostess:
shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.
BARDOLPH:
Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.
NYM:
Pish!
PISTOL:
Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!
Hostess:
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.
NYM:
Will you shog off? I would have you solus.
PISTOL:
'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!
PISTOL:
The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face,
PISTOL:
The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,
PISTOL:
And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,
PISTOL:
And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
PISTOL:
I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels,
PISTOL:
For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
PISTOL:
And flashing fire will follow.
NYM:
I am not Barbason, you cannot conjure me. I have an
NYM:
humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow
NYM:
foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my
NYM:
rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk
NYM:
off, I would prick your guts a little, in good
NYM:
terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.
PISTOL:
O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
PISTOL:
The grave doth gape, and doting death is near,
PISTOL:
Therefore exhale.
BARDOLPH:
Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the
BARDOLPH:
first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.
BARDOLPH:
Draws
PISTOL:
An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
PISTOL:
Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give
PISTOL:
Thy spirits are most tall.
NYM:
I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair
NYM:
terms: that is the humour of it.
PISTOL:
'Couple a gorge!'
PISTOL:
That is the word. I thee defy again.
PISTOL:
O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
PISTOL:
No, to the spital go,
PISTOL:
And from the powdering tub of infamy
PISTOL:
Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,
PISTOL:
Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse
PISTOL:
I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly
PISTOL:
For the only she, and--pauca, there's enough. Go to.
PISTOL:
Enter the Boy
Boy:
Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and
Boy:
you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.
Boy:
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and
Boy:
do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.
BARDOLPH:
Away, you rogue!
Hostess:
By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of
Hostess:
these days. The king has killed his heart. Good
Hostess:
husband, come home presently.
Hostess:
Exeunt Hostess and Boy
BARDOLPH:
Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to
BARDOLPH:
France together: why the devil should we keep
BARDOLPH:
knives to cut one another's throats?
PISTOL:
Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!
NYM:
You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?
PISTOL:
Base is the slave that pays.
NYM:
That now I will have: that's the humour of it.
PISTOL:
As manhood shall compound: push home.
PISTOL:
They draw
BARDOLPH:
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll
BARDOLPH:
kill him, by this sword, I will.
PISTOL:
Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.
BARDOLPH:
Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends
BARDOLPH:
an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.
BARDOLPH:
Prithee, put up.
NYM:
I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?
PISTOL:
A noble shalt thou have, and present pay,
PISTOL:
And liquor likewise will I give to thee,
PISTOL:
And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood
PISTOL:
I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me,
PISTOL:
Is not this just? for I shall sutler be
PISTOL:
Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.
PISTOL:
Give me thy hand.
NYM:
I shall have my noble?
PISTOL:
In cash most justly paid.
NYM:
Well, then, that's the humour of't.
NYM:
Re-enter Hostess
Hostess:
As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir
Hostess:
John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning
Hostess:
quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to
Hostess:
behold. Sweet men, come to him.
NYM:
The king hath run bad humours on the knight, that's
NYM:
the even of it.
PISTOL:
Nym, thou hast spoke the right,
PISTOL:
His heart is fracted and corroborate.
NYM:
The king is a good king: but it must be as it may,
NYM:
he passes some humours and careers.
PISTOL:
Let us condole the knight, for, lambkins we will live.
PISTOL:
SCENE II. Southampton. A council-chamber.
PISTOL:
Enter EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND
BEDFORD:
'Fore God, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.
EXETER:
They shall be apprehended by and by.
WESTMORELAND:
How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
WESTMORELAND:
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
WESTMORELAND:
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.
BEDFORD:
The king hath note of all that they intend,
BEDFORD:
By interception which they dream not of.
EXETER:
Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
EXETER:
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,
EXETER:
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
EXETER:
His sovereign's life to death and treachery.
EXETER:
Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and Attendants
KING HENRY V:
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
KING HENRY V:
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
KING HENRY V:
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts
KING HENRY V:
Think you not that the powers we bear with us
KING HENRY V:
Will cut their passage through the force of France,
KING HENRY V:
Doing the execution and the act
KING HENRY V:
For which we have in head assembled them?
SCROOP:
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
KING HENRY V:
I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded
KING HENRY V:
We carry not a heart with us from hence
KING HENRY V:
That grows not in a fair consent with ours,
KING HENRY V:
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
KING HENRY V:
Success and conquest to attend on us.
CAMBRIDGE:
Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
CAMBRIDGE:
Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject
CAMBRIDGE:
That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
CAMBRIDGE:
Under the sweet shade of your government.
GREY:
True: those that were your father's enemies
GREY:
Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
GREY:
With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
KING HENRY V:
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,
KING HENRY V:
And shall forget the office of our hand,
KING HENRY V:
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
KING HENRY V:
According to the weight and worthiness.
SCROOP:
So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
SCROOP:
And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
SCROOP:
To do your grace incessant services.
KING HENRY V:
We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
KING HENRY V:
Enlarge the man committed yesterday,
KING HENRY V:
That rail'd against our person: we consider
KING HENRY V:
it was excess of wine that set him on,
KING HENRY V:
And on his more advice we pardon him.
SCROOP:
That's mercy, but too much security
SCROOP:
Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example
SCROOP:
Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
KING HENRY V:
O, let us yet be merciful.
CAMBRIDGE:
So may your highness, and yet punish too.
GREY:
Sir,
GREY:
You show great mercy, if you give him life,
GREY:
After the taste of much correction.
KING HENRY V:
Alas, your too much love and care of me
KING HENRY V:
Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
KING HENRY V:
If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
KING HENRY V:
Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
KING HENRY V:
When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,
KING HENRY V:
Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,
KING HENRY V:
Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care
KING HENRY V:
And tender preservation of our person,
KING HENRY V:
Would have him punished. And now to our French causes
KING HENRY V:
Who are the late commissioners?
CAMBRIDGE:
I one, my lord
CAMBRIDGE:
Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.
SCROOP:
So did you me, my liege.
GREY:
And I, my royal sovereign.
KING HENRY V:
Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours,
KING HENRY V:
There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham, and, sir knight,
KING HENRY V:
Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours
KING HENRY V:
Read them, and know, I know your worthiness.
KING HENRY V:
My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,
KING HENRY V:
We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!
KING HENRY V:
What see you in those papers that you lose
KING HENRY V:
So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
KING HENRY V:
Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there
KING HENRY V:
That hath so cowarded and chased your blood
KING HENRY V:
Out of appearance?
CAMBRIDGE:
I do confess my fault,
CAMBRIDGE:
And do submit me to your highness' mercy.
SCROOP:
To which we all appeal.
KING HENRY V:
The mercy that was quick in us but late,
KING HENRY V:
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd
KING HENRY V:
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy,
KING HENRY V:
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
KING HENRY V:
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
KING HENRY V:
See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
KING HENRY V:
These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,
KING HENRY V:
You know how apt our love was to accord
KING HENRY V:
To furnish him with all appertinents
KING HENRY V:
Belonging to his honour, and this man
KING HENRY V:
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,
KING HENRY V:
And sworn unto the practises of France,
KING HENRY V:
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
KING HENRY V:
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
KING HENRY V:
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,
KING HENRY V:
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
KING HENRY V:
Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!
KING HENRY V:
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
KING HENRY V:
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
KING HENRY V:
That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,
KING HENRY V:
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,
KING HENRY V:
May it be possible, that foreign hire
KING HENRY V:
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
KING HENRY V:
That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
KING HENRY V:
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
KING HENRY V:
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
KING HENRY V:
Treason and murder ever kept together,
KING HENRY V:
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
KING HENRY V:
Working so grossly in a natural cause,
KING HENRY V:
That admiration did not whoop at them
KING HENRY V:
But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
KING HENRY V:
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder
KING HENRY V:
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
KING HENRY V:
That wrought upon thee so preposterously
KING HENRY V:
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence
KING HENRY V:
All other devils that suggest by treasons
KING HENRY V:
Do botch and bungle up damnation
KING HENRY V:
With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd
KING HENRY V:
From glistering semblances of piety,
KING HENRY V:
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,
KING HENRY V:
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
KING HENRY V:
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
KING HENRY V:
If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
KING HENRY V:
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
KING HENRY V:
He might return to vasty Tartar back,
KING HENRY V:
And tell the legions 'I can never win
KING HENRY V:
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
KING HENRY V:
O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected
KING HENRY V:
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
KING HENRY V:
Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?
KING HENRY V:
Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
KING HENRY V:
Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?
KING HENRY V:
Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,
KING HENRY V:
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
KING HENRY V:
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
KING HENRY V:
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
KING HENRY V:
Not working with the eye without the ear,
KING HENRY V:
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
KING HENRY V:
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
KING HENRY V:
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
KING HENRY V:
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
KING HENRY V:
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee,
KING HENRY V:
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
KING HENRY V:
Another fall of man. Their faults are open
KING HENRY V:
Arrest them to the answer of the law,
KING HENRY V:
And God acquit them of their practises!
EXETER:
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
EXETER:
Richard Earl of Cambridge.
EXETER:
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
EXETER:
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
EXETER:
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
EXETER:
Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.
SCROOP:
Our purposes God justly hath discover'd,
SCROOP:
And I repent my fault more than my death,
SCROOP:
Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
SCROOP:
Although my body pay the price of it.
CAMBRIDGE:
For me, the gold of France did not seduce,
CAMBRIDGE:
Although I did admit it as a motive
CAMBRIDGE:
The sooner to effect what I intended
CAMBRIDGE:
But God be thanked for prevention,
CAMBRIDGE:
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
CAMBRIDGE:
Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
GREY:
Never did faithful subject more rejoice
GREY:
At the discovery of most dangerous treason
GREY:
Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.
GREY:
Prevented from a damned enterprise
GREY:
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
KING HENRY V:
God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
KING HENRY V:
You have conspired against our royal person,
KING HENRY V:
Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
KING HENRY V:
Received the golden earnest of our death,
KING HENRY V:
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
KING HENRY V:
His princes and his peers to servitude,
KING HENRY V:
His subjects to oppression and contempt
KING HENRY V:
And his whole kingdom into desolation.
KING HENRY V:
Touching our person seek we no revenge,
KING HENRY V:
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
KING HENRY V:
Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
KING HENRY V:
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
KING HENRY V:
Poor miserable wretches, to your death
KING HENRY V:
The taste whereof, God of his mercy give
KING HENRY V:
You patience to endure, and true repentance
KING HENRY V:
Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded
KING HENRY V:
Now, lords, for France, the enterprise whereof
KING HENRY V:
Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.
KING HENRY V:
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
KING HENRY V:
Since God so graciously hath brought to light
KING HENRY V:
This dangerous treason lurking in our way
KING HENRY V:
To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
KING HENRY V:
But every rub is smoothed on our way.
KING HENRY V:
Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
KING HENRY V:
Our puissance into the hand of God,
KING HENRY V:
Putting it straight in expedition.
KING HENRY V:
Cheerly to sea, the signs of war advance
KING HENRY V:
No king of England, if not king of France.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt
KING HENRY V:
SCENE III. London. Before a tavern.
KING HENRY V:
Enter PISTOL, Hostess, NYM, BARDOLPH, and Boy
Hostess:
Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.
PISTOL:
No, for my manly heart doth yearn.
PISTOL:
Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins
PISTOL:
Boy, bristle thy courage up, for Falstaff he is dead,
PISTOL:
And we must yearn therefore.
BARDOLPH:
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in
BARDOLPH:
heaven or in hell!
Hostess:
Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's
Hostess:
bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made
Hostess:
a finer end and went away an it had been any
Hostess:
christom child, a' parted even just between twelve
Hostess:
and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after
Hostess:
I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with
Hostess:
flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew
Hostess:
there was but one way, for his nose was as sharp as
Hostess:
a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,
Hostess:
sir John!' quoth I	'what, man! be o' good
Hostess:
cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or
Hostess:
four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'
Hostess:
should not think of God, I hoped there was no need
Hostess:
to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So
Hostess:
a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my
Hostess:
hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as
Hostess:
cold as any stone, then I felt to his knees, and
Hostess:
they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and
Hostess:
upward, and all was as cold as any stone.
NYM:
They say he cried out of sack.
Hostess:
Ay, that a' did.
BARDOLPH:
And of women.
Hostess:
Nay, that a' did not.
Boy:
Yes, that a' did, and said they were devils
Boy:
incarnate.
Hostess:
A' could never abide carnation, 'twas a colour he
Hostess:
never liked.
Boy:
A' said once, the devil would have him about women.
Hostess:
A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women, but then
Hostess:
he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.
Boy:
Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon
Boy:
Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul
Boy:
burning in hell-fire?
BARDOLPH:
Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire
BARDOLPH:
that's all the riches I got in his service.
NYM:
Shall we shog? the king will be gone from
NYM:
Southampton.
PISTOL:
Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
PISTOL:
Look to my chattels and my movables
PISTOL:
Let senses rule, the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'
PISTOL:
Trust none,
PISTOL:
For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,
PISTOL:
And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck
PISTOL:
Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.
PISTOL:
Go, clear thy c rystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,
PISTOL:
Let us to France, like horse-leeches, my boys,
PISTOL:
To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!
Boy:
And that's but unwholesome food they say.
PISTOL:
Touch her soft mouth, and march.
BARDOLPH:
Farewell, hostess.
BARDOLPH:
Kissing her
NYM:
I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it, but, adieu.
PISTOL:
Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.
Hostess:
Farewell, adieu.
Hostess:
Exeunt
Hostess:
SCENE IV. France. The KING'S palace.
Hostess:
Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE, the Constable, and others
KING OF FRANCE:
Thus comes the English with full power upon us,
KING OF FRANCE:
And more than carefully it us concerns
KING OF FRANCE:
To answer royally in our defences.
KING OF FRANCE:
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,
KING OF FRANCE:
Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,
KING OF FRANCE:
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
KING OF FRANCE:
To line and new repair our towns of war
KING OF FRANCE:
With men of courage and with means defendant,
KING OF FRANCE:
For England his approaches makes as fierce
KING OF FRANCE:
As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
KING OF FRANCE:
It fits us then to be as provident
KING OF FRANCE:
As fear may teach us out of late examples
KING OF FRANCE:
Left by the fatal and neglected English
KING OF FRANCE:
Upon our fields.
DAUPHIN:
My most redoubted father,
DAUPHIN:
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe,
DAUPHIN:
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
DAUPHIN:
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
DAUPHIN:
But that defences, musters, preparations,
DAUPHIN:
Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,
DAUPHIN:
As were a war in expectation.
DAUPHIN:
Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
DAUPHIN:
To view the sick and feeble parts of France
DAUPHIN:
And let us do it with no show of fear,
DAUPHIN:
No, with no more than if we heard that England
DAUPHIN:
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance
DAUPHIN:
For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
DAUPHIN:
Her sceptre so fantastically borne
DAUPHIN:
By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
DAUPHIN:
That fear attends her not.
Constable:
O peace, Prince Dauphin!
Constable:
You are too much mistaken in this king
Constable:
Question your grace the late ambassadors,
Constable:
With what great state he heard their embassy,
Constable:
How well supplied with noble counsellors,
Constable:
How modest in exception, and withal
Constable:
How terrible in constant resolution,
Constable:
And you shall find his vanities forespent
Constable:
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
Constable:
Covering discretion with a coat of folly,
Constable:
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
Constable:
That shall first spring and be most delicate.
DAUPHIN:
Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable,
DAUPHIN:
But though we think it so, it is no matter
DAUPHIN:
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
DAUPHIN:
The enemy more mighty than he seems
DAUPHIN:
So the proportions of defence are fill'd,
DAUPHIN:
Which of a weak or niggardly projection
DAUPHIN:
Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
DAUPHIN:
A little cloth.
KING OF FRANCE:
Think we King Harry strong,
KING OF FRANCE:
And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
KING OF FRANCE:
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us,
KING OF FRANCE:
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
KING OF FRANCE:
That haunted us in our familiar paths
KING OF FRANCE:
Witness our too much memorable shame
KING OF FRANCE:
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
KING OF FRANCE:
And all our princes captiv'd by the hand
KING OF FRANCE:
Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales,
KING OF FRANCE:
Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,
KING OF FRANCE:
Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
KING OF FRANCE:
Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,
KING OF FRANCE:
Mangle the work of nature and deface
KING OF FRANCE:
The patterns that by God and by French fathers
KING OF FRANCE:
Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
KING OF FRANCE:
Of that victorious stock, and let us fear
KING OF FRANCE:
The native mightiness and fate of him.
KING OF FRANCE:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Ambassadors from Harry King of England
Messenger:
Do crave admittance to your majesty.
KING OF FRANCE:
We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.
KING OF FRANCE:
Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords
KING OF FRANCE:
You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.
DAUPHIN:
Turn head, and stop pursuit, for coward dogs
DAUPHIN:
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
DAUPHIN:
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
DAUPHIN:
Take up the English short, and let them know
DAUPHIN:
Of what a monarchy you are the head
DAUPHIN:
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
DAUPHIN:
As self-neglecting.
DAUPHIN:
Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and train
KING OF FRANCE:
From our brother England?
EXETER:
From him, and thus he greets your majesty.
EXETER:
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
EXETER:
That you divest yourself, and lay apart
EXETER:
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,
EXETER:
By law of nature and of nations, 'long
EXETER:
To him and to his heirs, namely, the crown
EXETER:
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
EXETER:
By custom and the ordinance of times
EXETER:
Unto the crown of France. That you may know
EXETER:
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
EXETER:
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
EXETER:
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
EXETER:
He sends you this most memorable line,
EXETER:
In every branch truly demonstrative,
EXETER:
Willing to overlook this pedigree
EXETER:
And when you find him evenly derived
EXETER:
From his most famed of famous ancestors,
EXETER:
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
EXETER:
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
EXETER:
From him the native and true challenger.
KING OF FRANCE:
Or else what follows?
EXETER:
Bloody constraint, for if you hide the crown
EXETER:
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it
EXETER:
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
EXETER:
In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
EXETER:
That, if requiring fail, he will compel,
EXETER:
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
EXETER:
Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
EXETER:
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
EXETER:
Opens his vasty jaws, and on your head
EXETER:
Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries
EXETER:
The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
EXETER:
For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,
EXETER:
That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
EXETER:
This is his claim, his threatening and my message,
EXETER:
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
EXETER:
To whom expressly I bring greeting too.
KING OF FRANCE:
For us, we will consider of this further
KING OF FRANCE:
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
KING OF FRANCE:
Back to our brother England.
DAUPHIN:
For the Dauphin,
DAUPHIN:
I stand here for him: what to him from England?
EXETER:
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt,
EXETER:
And any thing that may not misbecome
EXETER:
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
EXETER:
Thus says my king, an' if your father's highness
EXETER:
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
EXETER:
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
EXETER:
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,
EXETER:
That caves and womby vaultages of France
EXETER:
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
EXETER:
In second accent of his ordnance.
DAUPHIN:
Say, if my father render fair return,
DAUPHIN:
It is against my will, for I desire
DAUPHIN:
Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
DAUPHIN:
As matching to his youth and vanity,
DAUPHIN:
I did present him with the Paris balls.
EXETER:
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
EXETER:
Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe
EXETER:
And, be assured, you'll find a difference,
EXETER:
As we his subjects have in wonder found,
EXETER:
Between the promise of his greener days
EXETER:
And these he masters now: now he weighs time
EXETER:
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read
EXETER:
In your own losses, if he stay in France.
KING OF FRANCE:
To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.
EXETER:
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
EXETER:
Come here himself to question our delay,
EXETER:
For he is footed in this land already.
KING OF FRANCE:
You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions
KING OF FRANCE:
A night is but small breath and little pause
KING OF FRANCE:
To answer matters of this consequence.
KING OF FRANCE:
Flourish. Exeunt

KING OF FRANCE:
PROLOGUE
KING OF FRANCE:
Enter Chorus
Chorus:
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
Chorus:
In motion of no less celerity
Chorus:
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
Chorus:
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
Chorus:
Embark his royalty, and his brave fleet
Chorus:
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning
Chorus:
Play with your fancies, and in them behold
Chorus:
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing,
Chorus:
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
Chorus:
To sounds confused, behold the threaden sails,
Chorus:
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,
Chorus:
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
Chorus:
Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
Chorus:
You stand upon the ravage and behold
Chorus:
A city on the inconstant billows dancing,
Chorus:
For so appears this fleet majestical,
Chorus:
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow
Chorus:
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
Chorus:
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
Chorus:
Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,
Chorus:
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance,
Chorus:
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd
Chorus:
With one appearing hair, that will not follow
Chorus:
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
Chorus:
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege,
Chorus:
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
Chorus:
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Chorus:
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back,
Chorus:
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Chorus:
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,
Chorus:
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
Chorus:
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
Chorus:
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
Chorus:
Alarum, and chambers go off
Chorus:
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
Chorus:
And eke out our performance with your mind.
Chorus:
Exit
Chorus:
SCENE I. France. Before Harfleur.
Chorus:
Alarum. Enter KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers, with scaling-ladders
KING HENRY V:
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,
KING HENRY V:
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
KING HENRY V:
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
KING HENRY V:
As modest stillness and humility
KING HENRY V:
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
KING HENRY V:
Then imitate the action of the tiger,
KING HENRY V:
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
KING HENRY V:
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage,
KING HENRY V:
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect,
KING HENRY V:
Let pry through the portage of the head
KING HENRY V:
Like the brass cannon, let the brow o'erwhelm it
KING HENRY V:
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
KING HENRY V:
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
KING HENRY V:
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
KING HENRY V:
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
KING HENRY V:
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
KING HENRY V:
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
KING HENRY V:
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
KING HENRY V:
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
KING HENRY V:
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
KING HENRY V:
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument
KING HENRY V:
Dishonour not your mothers, now attest
KING HENRY V:
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
KING HENRY V:
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
KING HENRY V:
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
KING HENRY V:
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
KING HENRY V:
The mettle of your pasture, let us swear
KING HENRY V:
That you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not,
KING HENRY V:
For there is none of you so mean and base,
KING HENRY V:
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
KING HENRY V:
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
KING HENRY V:
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot
KING HENRY V:
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
KING HENRY V:
Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt. Alarum, and chambers go off
KING HENRY V:
SCENE II. The same.
KING HENRY V:
Enter NYM, BARDOLPH, PISTOL, and Boy
BARDOLPH:
On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!
NYM:
Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot,
NYM:
and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives
NYM:
the humour of it is too hot, that is the very
NYM:
plain-song of it.
PISTOL:
The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound
PISTOL:
Knocks go and come, God's vassals drop and die,
PISTOL:
And sword and shield,
PISTOL:
In bloody field,
PISTOL:
Doth win immortal fame.
Boy:
Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give
Boy:
all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.
PISTOL:
And I
PISTOL:
If wishes would prevail with me,
PISTOL:
My purpose should not fail with me,
PISTOL:
But thither would I hie.
Boy:
As duly, but not as truly,
Boy:
As bird doth sing on bough.
Boy:
Enter FLUELLEN
FLUELLEN:
Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you cullions!
FLUELLEN:
Driving them forward
PISTOL:
Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.
PISTOL:
Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,
PISTOL:
Abate thy rage, great duke!
PISTOL:
Good bawcock, bate thy rage, use lenity, sweet chuck!
NYM:
These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.
NYM:
Exeunt all but Boy
Boy:
As young as I am, I have observed these three
Boy:
swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
Boy:
three, though they would serve me, could not be man
Boy:
to me, for indeed three such antics do not amount to
Boy:
a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
Boy:
red-faced, by the means whereof a' faces it out, but
Boy:
fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
Boy:
and a quiet sword, by the means whereof a' breaks
Boy:
words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
Boy:
heard that men of few words are the best men, and
Boy:
therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'
Boy:
should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
Boy:
are matched with as few good deeds, for a' never
Boy:
broke any man's head but his own, and that was
Boy:
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
Boy:
any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
Boy:
lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
Boy:
three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
Boy:
brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
Boy:
fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
Boy:
men would carry coals. They would have me as
Boy:
familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
Boy:
handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
Boy:
if I should take from another's pocket to put into
Boy:
mine, for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
Boy:
must leave them, and seek some better service
Boy:
their villany goes against my weak stomach, and
Boy:
therefore I must cast it up.
Boy:
Exit
Boy:
Re-enter FLUELLEN, GOWER following
GOWER:
Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the
GOWER:
mines, the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
FLUELLEN:
To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good
FLUELLEN:
to come to the mines, for, look you, the mines is
FLUELLEN:
not according to the disciplines of the war: the
FLUELLEN:
concavities of it is not sufficient, for, look you,
FLUELLEN:
the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look
FLUELLEN:
you, is digt himself four yard under the
FLUELLEN:
countermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough up
FLUELLEN:
all, if there is not better directions.
GOWER:
The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the
GOWER:
siege is given, is altogether directed by an
GOWER:
Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.
FLUELLEN:
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
GOWER:
I think it be.
FLUELLEN:
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will
FLUELLEN:
verify as much in his beard: be has no more
FLUELLEN:
directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look
FLUELLEN:
you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.
FLUELLEN:
Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY
GOWER:
Here a' comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
FLUELLEN:
Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,
FLUELLEN:
that is certain, and of great expedition and
FLUELLEN:
knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular
FLUELLEN:
knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he will
FLUELLEN:
maintain his argument as well as any military man in
FLUELLEN:
the world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars
FLUELLEN:
of the Romans.
JAMY:
I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.
FLUELLEN:
God-den to your worship, good Captain James.
GOWER:
How now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit the
GOWER:
mines? have the pioneers given o'er?
MACMORRIS:
By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish give
MACMORRIS:
over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I
MACMORRIS:
swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done,
MACMORRIS:
it ish give over: I would have blowed up the town, so
MACMORRIS:
Chrish save me, la! in an hour: O, tish ill done,
MACMORRIS:
tish ill done, by my hand, tish ill done!
FLUELLEN:
Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you
FLUELLEN:
voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you,
FLUELLEN:
as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
FLUELLEN:
the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument,
FLUELLEN:
look you, and friendly communication, partly to
FLUELLEN:
satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction,
FLUELLEN:
look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of
FLUELLEN:
the military discipline, that is the point.
JAMY:
It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath
JAMY:
and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick
JAMY:
occasion, that sall I, marry.
MACMORRIS:
It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the
MACMORRIS:
day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the
MACMORRIS:
king, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The
MACMORRIS:
town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the
MACMORRIS:
breach, and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing
MACMORRIS:
'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to
MACMORRIS:
stand still, it is shame, by my hand: and there is
MACMORRIS:
throats to be cut, and works to be done, and there
MACMORRIS:
ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!
JAMY:
By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves
JAMY:
to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i'
JAMY:
the grund for it, ay, or go to death, and ay'll pay
JAMY:
't as valourously as I may, that sall I suerly do,
JAMY:
that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad full
JAMY:
fain hear some question 'tween you tway.
FLUELLEN:
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your
FLUELLEN:
correction, there is not many of your nation--
MACMORRIS:
Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,
MACMORRIS:
and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish
MACMORRIS:
my nation? Who talks of my nation?
FLUELLEN:
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is
FLUELLEN:
meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think
FLUELLEN:
you do not use me with that affability as in
FLUELLEN:
discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as
FLUELLEN:
good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of
FLUELLEN:
war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in
FLUELLEN:
other particularities.
MACMORRIS:
I do not know you so good a man as myself: so
MACMORRIS:
Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
GOWER:
Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
JAMY:
A! that's a foul fault.
JAMY:
A parley sounded
GOWER:
The town sounds a parley.
FLUELLEN:
Captain Macmorris, when there is more better
FLUELLEN:
opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so
FLUELLEN:
bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war,
FLUELLEN:
and there is an end.
FLUELLEN:
Exeunt
FLUELLEN:
SCENE III. The same. Before the gates.
FLUELLEN:
The Governor and some Citizens on the walls, the English forces below. Enter KING HENRY and his train
KING HENRY V:
How yet resolves the governor of the town?
KING HENRY V:
This is the latest parle we will admit,
KING HENRY V:
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves,
KING HENRY V:
Or like to men proud of destruction
KING HENRY V:
Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,
KING HENRY V:
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
KING HENRY V:
If I begin the battery once again,
KING HENRY V:
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
KING HENRY V:
Till in her ashes she lie buried.
KING HENRY V:
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
KING HENRY V:
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
KING HENRY V:
In liberty of bloody hand shall range
KING HENRY V:
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
KING HENRY V:
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.
KING HENRY V:
What is it then to me, if impious war,
KING HENRY V:
Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,
KING HENRY V:
Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
KING HENRY V:
Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
KING HENRY V:
What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
KING HENRY V:
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
KING HENRY V:
Of hot and forcing violation?
KING HENRY V:
What rein can hold licentious wickedness
KING HENRY V:
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
KING HENRY V:
We may as bootless spend our vain command
KING HENRY V:
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
KING HENRY V:
As send precepts to the leviathan
KING HENRY V:
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
KING HENRY V:
Take pity of your town and of your people,
KING HENRY V:
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command,
KING HENRY V:
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
KING HENRY V:
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
KING HENRY V:
Of heady murder, spoil and villany.
KING HENRY V:
If not, why, in a moment look to see
KING HENRY V:
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
KING HENRY V:
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters,
KING HENRY V:
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
KING HENRY V:
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,
KING HENRY V:
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
KING HENRY V:
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
KING HENRY V:
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
KING HENRY V:
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
KING HENRY V:
What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,
KING HENRY V:
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?
GOVERNOR:
Our expectation hath this day an end
GOVERNOR:
The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,
GOVERNOR:
Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
GOVERNOR:
To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,
GOVERNOR:
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
GOVERNOR:
Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours,
GOVERNOR:
For we no longer are defensible.
KING HENRY V:
Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,
KING HENRY V:
Go you and enter Harfleur, there remain,
KING HENRY V:
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French
KING HENRY V:
Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,
KING HENRY V:
The winter coming on and sickness growing
KING HENRY V:
Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
KING HENRY V:
To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest,
KING HENRY V:
To-morrow for the march are we addrest.
KING HENRY V:
Flourish. The King and his train enter the town
KING HENRY V:
SCENE IV. The FRENCH KING's palace.
KING HENRY V:

Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.
KATHARINE:
De nails. Ecoutez, dites-moi, si je parle bien: de

ALICE:
De neck, madame.
KATHARINE:
De nick. Et le menton?
ALICE:
De chin.
KATHARINE:
De sin. Le col, de nick, de menton, de sin.
ALICE:
Oui. Sauf votre honneur, en verite, vous prononcez
ALICE:
les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.
KATHARINE:
Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grace de Dieu,
KATHARINE:
et en peu de temps.
ALICE:
N'avez vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?
KATHARINE:
Non, je reciterai a vous promptement: de hand, de

De nails, madame.

De nails, de arm, de ilbow.

Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.
KATHARINE:
Ainsi dis-je, de elbow, de nick, et de sin. Comment
KATHARINE:
appelez-vous le pied et la robe?
ALICE:
De foot, madame, et de coun.
KATHARINE:
De foot et de coun! O Seigneur Dieu! ce sont mots
KATHARINE:
de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et
KATHARINE:
non pour les dames d'honneur d'user: je ne voudrais
KATHARINE:
prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France
KATHARINE:
pour tout le monde. Foh! le foot et le coun!
KATHARINE:
Neanmoins, je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon
KATHARINE:
ensemble: de hand, de fingres, de nails, de arm, de
KATHARINE:
elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot, de coun.
ALICE:
Excellent, madame!

Enter the KING OF FRANCE, the DAUPHIN, the DUKE oF BOURBON, the Constable Of France, and others
KING OF FRANCE:
'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.
Constable:
And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
Constable:
Let us not live in France, let us quit all
Constable:
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
DAUPHIN:
O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,
DAUPHIN:
The emptying of our fathers' luxury,
DAUPHIN:
Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
DAUPHIN:
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,
DAUPHIN:
And overlook their grafters?
BOURBON:
Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
BOURBON:
Mort de ma vie! if they march along
BOURBON:
Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,
BOURBON:
To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
BOURBON:
In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
Constable:
Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?
Constable:
Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,
Constable:
On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
Constable:
Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
Constable:
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
Constable:
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
Constable:
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
Constable:
Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,
Constable:
Let us not hang like roping icicles
Constable:
Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people
Constable:
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
Constable:
Poor we may call them in their native lords.
DAUPHIN:
By faith and honour,
DAUPHIN:
Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
DAUPHIN:
Our mettle is bred out and they will give
DAUPHIN:
Their bodies to the lust of English youth
DAUPHIN:
To new-store France with bastard warriors.
BOURBON:
They bid us to the English dancing-schools,
BOURBON:
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos,
BOURBON:
Saying our grace is only in our heels,
BOURBON:
And that we are most lofty runaways.
KING OF FRANCE:
Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence
KING OF FRANCE:
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
KING OF FRANCE:
Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged
KING OF FRANCE:
More sharper than your swords, hie to the field
KING OF FRANCE:
Charles Delabreth, high constable of France,
KING OF FRANCE:
You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,
KING OF FRANCE:
Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy,
KING OF FRANCE:
Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,
KING OF FRANCE:
Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg,
KING OF FRANCE:
Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois,
KING OF FRANCE:
High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,
KING OF FRANCE:
For your great seats now quit you of great shames.
KING OF FRANCE:
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
KING OF FRANCE:
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur
KING OF FRANCE:
Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
KING OF FRANCE:
Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
KING OF FRANCE:
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon
KING OF FRANCE:
Go down upon him, you have power enough,
KING OF FRANCE:
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
KING OF FRANCE:
Bring him our prisoner.
Constable:
This becomes the great.
Constable:
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
Constable:
His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
Constable:
For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
Constable:
He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
Constable:
And for achievement offer us his ransom.
KING OF FRANCE:
Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.
KING OF FRANCE:
And let him say to England that we send
KING OF FRANCE:
To know what willing ransom he will give.
KING OF FRANCE:
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
DAUPHIN:
Not so, I do beseech your majesty.
KING OF FRANCE:
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
KING OF FRANCE:
Now forth, lord constable and princes all,
KING OF FRANCE:
And quickly bring us word of England's fall.
KING OF FRANCE:
Exeunt
KING OF FRANCE:
SCENE VI. The English camp in Picardy.
KING OF FRANCE:
Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN, meeting
GOWER:
How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?
FLUELLEN:
I assure you, there is very excellent services
FLUELLEN:
committed at the bridge.
GOWER:
Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
FLUELLEN:
The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,
FLUELLEN:
and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my
FLUELLEN:
heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and
FLUELLEN:
my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and
FLUELLEN:
blessed!--any hurt in the world, but keeps the
FLUELLEN:
bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.
FLUELLEN:
There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
FLUELLEN:
pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as
FLUELLEN:
valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no
FLUELLEN:
estimation in the world, but did see him do as
FLUELLEN:
gallant service.
GOWER:
What do you call him?
FLUELLEN:
He is called Aunchient Pistol.
GOWER:
I know him not.
GOWER:
Enter PISTOL
FLUELLEN:
Here is the man.
PISTOL:
Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours
PISTOL:
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
FLUELLEN:
Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some love at
FLUELLEN:
his hands.
PISTOL:
Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,
PISTOL:
And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,
PISTOL:
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,
PISTOL:
That goddess blind,
PISTOL:
That stands upon the rolling restless stone--
FLUELLEN:
By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is
FLUELLEN:
painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to
FLUELLEN:
signify to you that Fortune is blind, and she is
FLUELLEN:
painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which
FLUELLEN:
is the moral of it, that she is turning, and
FLUELLEN:
inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her
FLUELLEN:
foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,
FLUELLEN:
which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,
FLUELLEN:
the poet makes a most excellent description of it
FLUELLEN:
Fortune is an excellent moral.
PISTOL:
Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him,
PISTOL:
For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be
PISTOL:
A damned death!
PISTOL:
Let gallows gape for dog, let man go free
PISTOL:
And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate
PISTOL:
But Exeter hath given the doom of death
PISTOL:
For pax of little price.
PISTOL:
Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice
PISTOL:
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
PISTOL:
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach
PISTOL:
Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
FLUELLEN:
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
PISTOL:
Why then, rejoice therefore.
FLUELLEN:
Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice
FLUELLEN:
at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would
FLUELLEN:
desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put
FLUELLEN:
him to execution, for discipline ought to be used.
PISTOL:
Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!
FLUELLEN:
It is well.
PISTOL:
The fig of Spain!
PISTOL:
Exit
FLUELLEN:
Very good.
GOWER:
Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal, I
GOWER:
remember him now, a bawd, a cutpurse.
FLUELLEN:
I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the
FLUELLEN:
bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it
FLUELLEN:
is very well, what he has spoke to me, that is well,
FLUELLEN:
I warrant you, when time is serve.
GOWER:
Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then
GOWER:
goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return
GOWER:
into London under the form of a soldier. And such
GOWER:
fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names
GOWER:
and they will learn you by rote where services were
GOWER:
done, at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,
GOWER:
at such a convoy, who came off bravely, who was
GOWER:
shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on,
GOWER:
and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,
GOWER:
which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what
GOWER:
a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of
GOWER:
the camp will do among foaming bottles and
GOWER:
ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But
GOWER:
you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or
GOWER:
else you may be marvellously mistook.
FLUELLEN:
I tell you what, Captain Gower, I do perceive he is
FLUELLEN:
not the man that he would gladly make show to the
FLUELLEN:
world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will
FLUELLEN:
tell him my mind.
FLUELLEN:
Drum heard
FLUELLEN:
Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with
FLUELLEN:
him from the pridge.
FLUELLEN:
Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers
FLUELLEN:
God pless your majesty!
KING HENRY V:
How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?
FLUELLEN:
Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has
FLUELLEN:
very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is
FLUELLEN:
gone off, look you, and there is gallant and most
FLUELLEN:
prave passages, marry, th' athversary was have
FLUELLEN:
possession of the pridge, but he is enforced to
FLUELLEN:
retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the
FLUELLEN:
pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a
FLUELLEN:
prave man.
KING HENRY V:
What men have you lost, Fluellen?
FLUELLEN:
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very
FLUELLEN:
great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I
FLUELLEN:
think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that
FLUELLEN:
is like to be executed for robbing a church, one
FLUELLEN:
Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is
FLUELLEN:
all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'
FLUELLEN:
fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like
FLUELLEN:
a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red,
FLUELLEN:
but his nose is executed and his fire's out.
KING HENRY V:
We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we
KING HENRY V:
give express charge, that in our marches through the
KING HENRY V:
country, there be nothing compelled from the
KING HENRY V:
villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the
KING HENRY V:
French upbraided or abused in disdainful language,
KING HENRY V:
for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the
KING HENRY V:
gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
KING HENRY V:
Tucket. Enter MONTJOY
MONTJOY:
You know me by my habit.
KING HENRY V:
Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?
MONTJOY:
My master's mind.
KING HENRY V:
Unfold it.
MONTJOY:
Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England
MONTJOY:
Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage
MONTJOY:
is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we
MONTJOY:
could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we
MONTJOY:
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
MONTJOY:
full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice
MONTJOY:
is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see
MONTJOY:
his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
MONTJOY:
therefore consider of his ransom, which must
MONTJOY:
proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we
MONTJOY:
have lost, the disgrace we have digested, which in
MONTJOY:
weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.
MONTJOY:
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor, for the
MONTJOY:
effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too
MONTJOY:
faint a number, and for our disgrace, his own
MONTJOY:
person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and
MONTJOY:
worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and
MONTJOY:
tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his
MONTJOY:
followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far
MONTJOY:
my king and master, so much my office.
KING HENRY V:
What is thy name? I know thy quality.
MONTJOY:
Montjoy.
KING HENRY V:
Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.
KING HENRY V:
And tell thy king I do not seek him now,
KING HENRY V:
But could be willing to march on to Calais
KING HENRY V:
Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,
KING HENRY V:
Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
KING HENRY V:
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
KING HENRY V:
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
KING HENRY V:
My numbers lessened, and those few I have
KING HENRY V:
Almost no better than so many French,
KING HENRY V:
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
KING HENRY V:
I thought upon one pair of English legs
KING HENRY V:
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
KING HENRY V:
That I do brag thus! This your air of France
KING HENRY V:
Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.
KING HENRY V:
Go therefore, tell thy master here I am,
KING HENRY V:
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
KING HENRY V:
My army but a weak and sickly guard,
KING HENRY V:
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
KING HENRY V:
Though France himself and such another neighbour
KING HENRY V:
Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.
KING HENRY V:
Go bid thy master well advise himself
KING HENRY V:
If we may pass, we will, if we be hinder'd,
KING HENRY V:
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
KING HENRY V:
Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
KING HENRY V:
The sum of all our answer is but this
KING HENRY V:
We would not seek a battle, as we are,
KING HENRY V:
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it
KING HENRY V:
So tell your master.
MONTJOY:
I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.
MONTJOY:
Exit
GLOUCESTER:
I hope they will not come upon us now.
KING HENRY V:
We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
KING HENRY V:
March to the bridge, it now draws toward night
KING HENRY V:
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
KING HENRY V:
And on to-morrow, bid them march away.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt
KING HENRY V:
SCENE VII. The French camp, near Agincourt
KING HENRY V:
Enter the Constable of France, the LORD RAMBURES, ORLEANS, DAUPHIN, with others
Constable:
Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!
ORLEANS:
You have an excellent armour, but let my horse have his due.
Constable:
It is the best horse of Europe.
ORLEANS:
Will it never be morning?
DAUPHIN:
My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you
DAUPHIN:
talk of horse and armour?
ORLEANS:
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
DAUPHIN:
What a long night is this! I will not change my
DAUPHIN:
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
DAUPHIN:
Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
DAUPHIN:
entrails were hairs, le cheval volant, the Pegasus,
DAUPHIN:
chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I
DAUPHIN:
soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air, the earth
DAUPHIN:
sings when he touches it, the basest horn of his
DAUPHIN:
hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.
ORLEANS:
He's of the colour of the nutmeg.
DAUPHIN:
And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for
DAUPHIN:
Perseus: he is pure air and fire, and the dull
DAUPHIN:
elements of earth and water never appear in him, but
DAUPHIN:
only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
DAUPHIN:
him: he is indeed a horse, and all other jades you
DAUPHIN:
may call beasts.
Constable:
Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
DAUPHIN:
It is the prince of palfreys, his neigh is like the
DAUPHIN:
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.
ORLEANS:
No more, cousin.
DAUPHIN:
Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the
DAUPHIN:
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary
DAUPHIN:
deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as
DAUPHIN:
fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent
DAUPHIN:
tongues, and my horse is argument for them all
DAUPHIN:
'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for
DAUPHIN:
a sovereign's sovereign to ride on, and for the
DAUPHIN:
world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
DAUPHIN:
their particular functions and wonder at him. I
DAUPHIN:
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus
DAUPHIN:
'Wonder of nature,'--
ORLEANS:
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
DAUPHIN:
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my
DAUPHIN:
courser, for my horse is my mistress.
ORLEANS:
Your mistress bears well.
DAUPHIN:
Me well, which is the prescript praise and
DAUPHIN:
perfection of a good and particular mistress.
Constable:
Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
Constable:
shook your back.
DAUPHIN:
So perhaps did yours.
Constable:
Mine was not bridled.
DAUPHIN:
O then belike she was old and gentle, and you rode,
DAUPHIN:
like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in
DAUPHIN:
your straight strossers.
Constable:
You have good judgment in horsemanship.
DAUPHIN:
Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride
DAUPHIN:
not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have
DAUPHIN:
my horse to my mistress.
Constable:
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
DAUPHIN:
I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
Constable:
I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow
Constable:
to my mistress.
DAUPHIN:
'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et
DAUPHIN:
la truie lavee au bourbier,' thou makest use of any thing.
Constable:
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any
Constable:
such proverb so little kin to the purpose.
RAMBURES:
My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent
RAMBURES:
to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?
Constable:
Stars, my lord.
DAUPHIN:
Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.
Constable:
And yet my sky shall not want.
DAUPHIN:
That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and
DAUPHIN:
'twere more honour some were away.
Constable:
Even as your horse bears your praises, who would
Constable:
trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.
DAUPHIN:
Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will
DAUPHIN:
it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and
DAUPHIN:
my way shall be paved with English faces.
Constable:
I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of
Constable:
my way: but I would it were morning, for I would
Constable:
fain be about the ears of the English.
RAMBURES:
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?
Constable:
You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.
DAUPHIN:
'Tis midnight, I'll go arm myself.
DAUPHIN:
Exit
ORLEANS:
The Dauphin longs for morning.
RAMBURES:
He longs to eat the English.
Constable:
I think he will eat all he kills.
ORLEANS:
By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.
Constable:
Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
ORLEANS:
He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
Constable:
Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.
ORLEANS:
He never did harm, that I heard of.
Constable:
Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.
ORLEANS:
I know him to be valiant.
Constable:
I was told that  by one that knows him better than
Constable:
you.
ORLEANS:
What's he?
Constable:
Marry, he told me so himself, and he said he cared
Constable:
not who knew it
ORLEANS:
He needs not, it is no hidden virtue in him.
Constable:
By my faith, sir, but it is, never any body saw it
Constable:
but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour, and when it
Constable:
appears, it will bate.
ORLEANS:
Ill will never said well.
Constable:
I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'
ORLEANS:
And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'
Constable:
Well placed: there stands your friend for the
Constable:
devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A
Constable:
pox of the devil.'
ORLEANS:
You are the better at proverbs, by how much 'A
ORLEANS:
fool's bolt is soon shot.'
Constable:
You have shot over.
ORLEANS:
'Tis not the first time you were overshot.
ORLEANS:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
My lord high constable, the English lie within
Messenger:
fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
Constable:
Who hath measured the ground?
Messenger:
The Lord Grandpre.
Constable:
A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were
Constable:
day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for
Constable:
the dawning as we do.
ORLEANS:
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
ORLEANS:
England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so
ORLEANS:
far out of his knowledge!
Constable:
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
ORLEANS:
That they lack, for if their heads had any
ORLEANS:
intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy
ORLEANS:
head-pieces.
RAMBURES:
That island of England breeds very valiant
RAMBURES:
creatures, their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
ORLEANS:
Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a
ORLEANS:
Russian bear and have their heads crushed like
ORLEANS:
rotten apples! You may as well say, that's a
ORLEANS:
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
Constable:
Just, just, and the men do sympathize with the
Constable:
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving
Constable:
their wits with their wives: and then give them
Constable:
great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will
Constable:
eat like wolves and fight like devils.
ORLEANS:
Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
Constable:
Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs
Constable:
to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm
Constable:
come, shall we about it?
ORLEANS:
It is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by ten
ORLEANS:
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
ORLEANS:
Exeunt

Enter Chorus
Chorus:
Now entertain conjecture of a time
Chorus:
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Chorus:
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
Chorus:
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
Chorus:
The hum of either army stilly sounds,
Chorus:
That the fixed sentinels almost receive
Chorus:
The secret whispers of each other's watch
Chorus:
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
Chorus:
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face,
Chorus:
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
Chorus:
Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
Chorus:
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
Chorus:
With busy hammers closing rivets up,
Chorus:
Give dreadful note of preparation
Chorus:
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
Chorus:
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
Chorus:
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
Chorus:
The confident and over-lusty French
Chorus:
Do the low-rated English play at dice,
Chorus:
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
Chorus:
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
Chorus:
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
Chorus:
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
Chorus:
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
Chorus:
The morning's danger, and their gesture sad
Chorus:
Investing lank-lean, cheeks and war-worn coats
Chorus:
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
Chorus:
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
Chorus:
The royal captain of this ruin'd band
Chorus:
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
Chorus:
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
Chorus:
For forth he goes and visits all his host.
Chorus:
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
Chorus:
And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
Chorus:
Upon his royal face there is no note
Chorus:
How dread an army hath enrounded him,
Chorus:
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
Chorus:
Unto the weary and all-watched night,
Chorus:
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
Chorus:
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty,
Chorus:
That every wretch, pining and pale before,
Chorus:
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks
Chorus:
A largess universal like the sun
Chorus:
His liberal eye doth give to every one,
Chorus:
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,
Chorus:
Behold, as may unworthiness define,
Chorus:
A little touch of Harry in the night.
Chorus:
And so our scene must to the battle fly,
Chorus:
Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace
Chorus:
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
Chorus:
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
Chorus:
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
Chorus:
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

Enter KING HENRY, BEDFORD, and GLOUCESTER
KING HENRY V:
Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger,
KING HENRY V:
The greater therefore should our courage be.
KING HENRY V:
Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!
KING HENRY V:
There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
KING HENRY V:
Would men observingly distil it out.
KING HENRY V:
For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,
KING HENRY V:
Which is both healthful and good husbandry
KING HENRY V:
Besides, they are our outward consciences,
KING HENRY V:
And preachers to us all, admonishing
KING HENRY V:
That we should dress us fairly for our end.
KING HENRY V:
Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
KING HENRY V:
And make a moral of the devil himself.
KING HENRY V:
Enter ERPINGHAM
KING HENRY V:
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham
KING HENRY V:
A good soft pillow for that good white head
KING HENRY V:
Were better than a churlish turf of France.
ERPINGHAM:
Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,
ERPINGHAM:
Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'
KING HENRY V:
'Tis good for men to love their present pains
KING HENRY V:
Upon example, so the spirit is eased
KING HENRY V:
And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,
KING HENRY V:
The organs, though defunct and dead before,
KING HENRY V:
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,
KING HENRY V:
With casted slough and fresh legerity.
KING HENRY V:
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
KING HENRY V:
Commend me to the princes in our camp,
KING HENRY V:
Do my good morrow to them, and anon
KING HENRY V:
Desire them an to my pavilion.
GLOUCESTER:
We shall, my liege.
ERPINGHAM:
Shall I attend your grace?
KING HENRY V:
No, my good knight,
KING HENRY V:
Go with my brothers to my lords of England
KING HENRY V:
I and my bosom must debate awhile,
KING HENRY V:
And then I would no other company.
ERPINGHAM:
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!
ERPINGHAM:
Exeunt all but KING HENRY
KING HENRY V:
God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.
KING HENRY V:
Enter PISTOL
PISTOL:
Qui va la?
KING HENRY V:
A friend.
PISTOL:
Discuss unto me, art thou officer?
PISTOL:
Or art thou base, common and popular?
KING HENRY V:
I am a gentleman of a company.
PISTOL:
Trail'st thou the puissant pike?
KING HENRY V:
Even so. What are you?
PISTOL:
As good a gentleman as the emperor.
KING HENRY V:
Then you are a better than the king.
PISTOL:
The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,
PISTOL:
A lad of life, an imp of fame,
PISTOL:
Of parents good, of fist most valiant.
PISTOL:
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string
PISTOL:
I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?
KING HENRY V:
Harry le Roy.
PISTOL:
Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?
KING HENRY V:
No, I am a Welshman.
PISTOL:
Know'st thou Fluellen?
KING HENRY V:
Yes.
PISTOL:
Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate
PISTOL:
Upon Saint Davy's day.
KING HENRY V:
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,
KING HENRY V:
lest he knock that about yours.
PISTOL:
Art thou his friend?
KING HENRY V:
And his kinsman too.
PISTOL:
The figo for thee, then!
KING HENRY V:
I thank you: God be with you!
PISTOL:
My name is Pistol call'd.
PISTOL:
Exit
KING HENRY V:
It sorts well with your fierceness.
KING HENRY V:
Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER
GOWER:
Captain Fluellen!
FLUELLEN:
So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It is
FLUELLEN:
the greatest admiration of the universal world, when
FLUELLEN:
the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
FLUELLEN:
wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to
FLUELLEN:
examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall
FLUELLEN:
find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle
FLUELLEN:
nor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp, I warrant you,
FLUELLEN:
you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the
FLUELLEN:
cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety
FLUELLEN:
of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.
GOWER:
Why, the enemy is loud, you hear him all night.
FLUELLEN:
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
FLUELLEN:
coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,
FLUELLEN:
look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating
FLUELLEN:
coxcomb? in your own conscience, now?
GOWER:
I will speak lower.
FLUELLEN:
I pray you and beseech you that you will.
FLUELLEN:
Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN
KING HENRY V:
Though it appear a little out of fashion,
KING HENRY V:
There is much care and valour in this Welshman.
KING HENRY V:
Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT, and MICHAEL WILLIAMS
COURT:
Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which
COURT:
breaks yonder?
BATES:
I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire
BATES:
the approach of day.
WILLIAMS:
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think
WILLIAMS:
we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?
KING HENRY V:
A friend.
WILLIAMS:
Under what captain serve you?
KING HENRY V:
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
WILLIAMS:
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I
WILLIAMS:
pray you, what thinks he of our estate?
KING HENRY V:
Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be
KING HENRY V:
washed off the next tide.
BATES:
He hath not told his thought to the king?
KING HENRY V:
No, nor it is not meet he should. For, though I
KING HENRY V:
speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I
KING HENRY V:
am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the
KING HENRY V:
element shows to him as it doth to me, all his
KING HENRY V:
senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies
KING HENRY V:
laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man, and
KING HENRY V:
though his affections are higher mounted than ours,
KING HENRY V:
yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like
KING HENRY V:
wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we
KING HENRY V:
do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish
KING HENRY V:
as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess
KING HENRY V:
him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing
KING HENRY V:
it, should dishearten his army.
BATES:
He may show what outward courage he will, but I
BATES:
believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish
BATES:
himself in Thames up to the neck, and so I would he
BATES:
were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
KING HENRY V:
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king
KING HENRY V:
I think he would not wish himself any where but
KING HENRY V:
where he is.
BATES:
Then I would he were here alone, so should he be
BATES:
sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.
KING HENRY V:
I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here
KING HENRY V:
alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
KING HENRY V:
minds: methinks I could not die any where so
KING HENRY V:
contented as in the king's company, his cause being
KING HENRY V:
just and his quarrel honourable.
WILLIAMS:
That's more than we know.
BATES:
Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we know
BATES:
enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if
BATES:
his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes
BATES:
the crime of it out of us.
WILLIAMS:
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath
WILLIAMS:
a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and
WILLIAMS:
arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join
WILLIAMS:
together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at
WILLIAMS:
such a place,' some swearing, some crying for a
WILLIAMS:
surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind
WILLIAMS:
them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their
WILLIAMS:
children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die
WILLIAMS:
well that die in a battle, for how can they
WILLIAMS:
charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their
WILLIAMS:
argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it
WILLIAMS:
will be a black matter for the king that led them to
WILLIAMS:
it, whom to disobey were against all proportion of
WILLIAMS:
subjection.
KING HENRY V:
So, if a son that is by his father sent about
KING HENRY V:
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the
KING HENRY V:
imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be
KING HENRY V:
imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
KING HENRY V:
servant, under his master's command transporting a
KING HENRY V:
sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in
KING HENRY V:
many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the
KING HENRY V:
business of the master the author of the servant's
KING HENRY V:
damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
KING HENRY V:
bound to answer the particular endings of his
KING HENRY V:
soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of
KING HENRY V:
his servant, for they purpose not their death, when
KING HENRY V:
they purpose their services. Besides, there is no
KING HENRY V:
king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to
KING HENRY V:
the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all
KING HENRY V:
unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
KING HENRY V:
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder,
KING HENRY V:
some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
KING HENRY V:
perjury, some, making the wars their bulwark, that
KING HENRY V:
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
KING HENRY V:
pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
KING HENRY V:
defeated the law and outrun native punishment,
KING HENRY V:
though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to
KING HENRY V:
fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance,
KING HENRY V:
so that here men are punished for before-breach of
KING HENRY V:
the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where
KING HENRY V:
they feared the death, they have borne life away,
KING HENRY V:
and where they would be safe, they perish: then if
KING HENRY V:
they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of
KING HENRY V:
their damnation than he was before guilty of those
KING HENRY V:
impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
KING HENRY V:
subject's duty is the king's, but every subject's
KING HENRY V:
soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
KING HENRY V:
the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every
KING HENRY V:
mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death
KING HENRY V:
is to him advantage, or not dying, the time was
KING HENRY V:
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained
KING HENRY V:
and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think
KING HENRY V:
that, making God so free an offer, He let him
KING HENRY V:
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
KING HENRY V:
others how they should prepare.
WILLIAMS:
'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon
WILLIAMS:
his own head, the king is not to answer it.
BATES:
But I do not desire he should answer for me, and
BATES:
yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
KING HENRY V:
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
WILLIAMS:
Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but
WILLIAMS:
when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we
WILLIAMS:
ne'er the wiser.
KING HENRY V:
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
WILLIAMS:
You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an
WILLIAMS:
elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can
WILLIAMS:
do against a monarch! you may as well go about to
WILLIAMS:
turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
WILLIAMS:
peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
WILLIAMS:
after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.
KING HENRY V:
Your reproof is something too round: I should be
KING HENRY V:
angry with you, if the time were convenient.
WILLIAMS:
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
KING HENRY V:
I embrace it.
WILLIAMS:
How shall I know thee again?
KING HENRY V:
Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my
KING HENRY V:
bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I
KING HENRY V:
will make it my quarrel.
WILLIAMS:
Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
KING HENRY V:
There.
WILLIAMS:
This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come
WILLIAMS:
to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'
WILLIAMS:
by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.
KING HENRY V:
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.
WILLIAMS:
Thou darest as well be hanged.
KING HENRY V:
Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the
KING HENRY V:
king's company.
WILLIAMS:
Keep thy word: fare thee well.
BATES:
Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have
BATES:
French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.
KING HENRY V:
Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to
KING HENRY V:
one, they will beat us, for they bear them on their
KING HENRY V:
shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut
KING HENRY V:
French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will
KING HENRY V:
be a clipper.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt soldiers
KING HENRY V:
Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,
KING HENRY V:
Our debts, our careful wives,
KING HENRY V:
Our children and our sins lay on the king!
KING HENRY V:
We must bear all. O hard condition,
KING HENRY V:
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
KING HENRY V:
Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel
KING HENRY V:
But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease
KING HENRY V:
Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!
KING HENRY V:
And what have kings, that privates have not too,
KING HENRY V:
Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
KING HENRY V:
And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?
KING HENRY V:
What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more
KING HENRY V:
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
KING HENRY V:
What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?
KING HENRY V:
O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
KING HENRY V:
What is thy soul of adoration?
KING HENRY V:
Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,
KING HENRY V:
Creating awe and fear in other men?
KING HENRY V:
Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
KING HENRY V:
Than they in fearing.
KING HENRY V:
What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
KING HENRY V:
But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
KING HENRY V:
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
KING HENRY V:
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
KING HENRY V:
With titles blown from adulation?
KING HENRY V:
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
KING HENRY V:
Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,
KING HENRY V:
Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
KING HENRY V:
That play'st so subtly with a king's repose,
KING HENRY V:
I am a king that find thee, and I know
KING HENRY V:
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,
KING HENRY V:
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
KING HENRY V:
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
KING HENRY V:
The farced title running 'fore the king,
KING HENRY V:
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
KING HENRY V:
That beats upon the high shore of this world,
KING HENRY V:
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
KING HENRY V:
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
KING HENRY V:
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
KING HENRY V:
Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
KING HENRY V:
Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread,
KING HENRY V:
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
KING HENRY V:
But, like a lackey, from the rise to set
KING HENRY V:
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
KING HENRY V:
Sleeps in Elysium, next day after dawn,
KING HENRY V:
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,
KING HENRY V:
And follows so the ever-running year,
KING HENRY V:
With profitable labour, to his grave
KING HENRY V:
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
KING HENRY V:
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
KING HENRY V:
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.
KING HENRY V:
The slave, a member of the country's peace,
KING HENRY V:
Enjoys it, but in gross brain little wots
KING HENRY V:
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,
KING HENRY V:
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.
KING HENRY V:
Enter ERPINGHAM
ERPINGHAM:
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,
ERPINGHAM:
Seek through your camp to find you.
KING HENRY V:
Good old knight,
KING HENRY V:
Collect them all together at my tent
KING HENRY V:
I'll be before thee.
ERPINGHAM:
I shall do't, my lord.
ERPINGHAM:
Exit
KING HENRY V:
O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts,
KING HENRY V:
Possess them not with fear, take from them now
KING HENRY V:
The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers
KING HENRY V:
Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,
KING HENRY V:
O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
KING HENRY V:
My father made in compassing the crown!
KING HENRY V:
I Richard's body have interred anew,
KING HENRY V:
And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears
KING HENRY V:
Than from it issued forced drops of blood
KING HENRY V:
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,
KING HENRY V:
Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up
KING HENRY V:
Toward heaven, to pardon blood, and I have built
KING HENRY V:
Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
KING HENRY V:
Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do,
KING HENRY V:
Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
KING HENRY V:
Since that my penitence comes after all,
KING HENRY V:
Imploring pardon.
KING HENRY V:
Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
My liege!
KING HENRY V:
My brother Gloucester's voice? Ay,
KING HENRY V:
I know thy errand, I will go with thee
KING HENRY V:
The day, my friends and all things stay for me.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt
KING HENRY V:
SCENE II. The French camp.
KING HENRY V:
Enter the DAUPHIN, ORLEANS, RAMBURES, and others
ORLEANS:
The sun doth gild our armour, up, my lords!
DAUPHIN:
Montez A cheval! My horse! varlet! laquais! ha!
ORLEANS:
O brave spirit!
DAUPHIN:
Via! les eaux et la terre.
ORLEANS:
Rien puis? L'air et la feu.
DAUPHIN:
Ciel, cousin Orleans.
DAUPHIN:
Enter Constable
DAUPHIN:
Now, my lord constable!
Constable:
Hark, how our steeds for present service neigh!
DAUPHIN:
Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
DAUPHIN:
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
DAUPHIN:
And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!
RAMBURES:
What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?
RAMBURES:
How shall we, then, behold their natural tears?
RAMBURES:
Enter Messenger
Messenger:
The English are embattled, you French peers.
Constable:
To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!
Constable:
Do but behold yon poor and starved band,
Constable:
And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
Constable:
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
Constable:
There is not work enough for all our hands,
Constable:
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
Constable:
To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,
Constable:
That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,
Constable:
And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,
Constable:
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.
Constable:
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
Constable:
That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
Constable:
Who in unnecessary action swarm
Constable:
About our squares of battle, were enow
Constable:
To purge this field of such a hilding foe,
Constable:
Though we upon this mountain's basis by
Constable:
Took stand for idle speculation
Constable:
But that our honours must not. What's to say?
Constable:
A very little little let us do.
Constable:
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
Constable:
The tucket sonance and the note to mount,
Constable:
For our approach shall so much dare the field
Constable:
That England shall couch down in fear and yield.
Constable:
Enter GRANDPRE
GRANDPRE:
Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?
GRANDPRE:
Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
GRANDPRE:
Ill-favouredly become the morning field
GRANDPRE:
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,
GRANDPRE:
And our air shakes them passing scornfully
GRANDPRE:
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
GRANDPRE:
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
GRANDPRE:
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,
GRANDPRE:
With torch-staves in their hand, and their poor jades
GRANDPRE:
Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
GRANDPRE:
The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes
GRANDPRE:
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
GRANDPRE:
Lies foul with chew'd grass, still and motionless,
GRANDPRE:
And their executors, the knavish crows,
GRANDPRE:
Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.
GRANDPRE:
Description cannot suit itself in words
GRANDPRE:
To demonstrate the life of such a battle
GRANDPRE:
In life so lifeless as it shows itself.
Constable:
They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.
DAUPHIN:
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
DAUPHIN:
And give their fasting horses provender,
DAUPHIN:
And after fight with them?
Constable:
I stay but for my guidon: to the field!
Constable:
I will the banner from a trumpet take,
Constable:
And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!
Constable:
The sun is high, and we outwear the day.
Constable:
Exeunt
Constable:
SCENE III. The English camp.
Constable:
Enter GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, ERPINGHAM, with all his host: SALISBURY and WESTMORELAND
GLOUCESTER:
Where is the king?
BEDFORD:
The king himself is rode to view their battle.
WESTMORELAND:
Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.
EXETER:
There's five to one, besides, they all are fresh.
SALISBURY:
God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
SALISBURY:
God be wi' you, princes all, I'll to my charge
SALISBURY:
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,
SALISBURY:
Then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,
SALISBURY:
My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
SALISBURY:
And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu!
BEDFORD:
Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee!
EXETER:
Farewell, kind lord, fight valiantly to-day
EXETER:
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,
EXETER:
For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.
EXETER:
Exit SALISBURY
BEDFORD:
He is full of valour as of kindness,
BEDFORD:
Princely in both.
BEDFORD:
Enter the KING
WESTMORELAND:
O that we now had here
WESTMORELAND:
But one ten thousand of those men in England
WESTMORELAND:
That do no work to-day!
KING HENRY V:
What's he that wishes so?
KING HENRY V:
My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin
KING HENRY V:
If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
KING HENRY V:
To do our country loss, and if to live,
KING HENRY V:
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
KING HENRY V:
God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
KING HENRY V:
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
KING HENRY V:
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost,
KING HENRY V:
It yearns me not if men my garments wear,
KING HENRY V:
Such outward things dwell not in my desires
KING HENRY V:
But if it be a sin to covet honour,
KING HENRY V:
I am the most offending soul alive.
KING HENRY V:
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England
KING HENRY V:
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
KING HENRY V:
As one man more, methinks, would share from me
KING HENRY V:
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
KING HENRY V:
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
KING HENRY V:
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
KING HENRY V:
Let him depart, his passport shall be made
KING HENRY V:
And crowns for convoy put into his purse
KING HENRY V:
We would not die in that man's company
KING HENRY V:
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
KING HENRY V:
This day is called the feast of Crispian
KING HENRY V:
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
KING HENRY V:
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
KING HENRY V:
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
KING HENRY V:
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
KING HENRY V:
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
KING HENRY V:
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
KING HENRY V:
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
KING HENRY V:
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
KING HENRY V:
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
KING HENRY V:
But he'll remember with advantages
KING HENRY V:
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
KING HENRY V:
Familiar in his mouth as household words
KING HENRY V:
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
KING HENRY V:
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
KING HENRY V:
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.
KING HENRY V:
This story shall the good man teach his son,
KING HENRY V:
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
KING HENRY V:
From this day to the ending of the world,
KING HENRY V:
But we in it shall be remember'd,
KING HENRY V:
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers,
KING HENRY V:
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
KING HENRY V:
Shall be my brother, be he ne'er so vile,
KING HENRY V:
This day shall gentle his condition
KING HENRY V:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
KING HENRY V:
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
KING HENRY V:
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
KING HENRY V:
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
KING HENRY V:
Re-enter SALISBURY
SALISBURY:
My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed
SALISBURY:
The French are bravely in their battles set,
SALISBURY:
And will with all expedience charge on us.
KING HENRY V:
All things are ready, if our minds be so.
WESTMORELAND:
Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
KING HENRY V:
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
WESTMORELAND:
God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,
WESTMORELAND:
Without more help, could fight this royal battle!
KING HENRY V:
Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men,
KING HENRY V:
Which likes me better than to wish us one.
KING HENRY V:
You know your places: God be with you all!
KING HENRY V:
Tucket. Enter MONTJOY
MONTJOY:
Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,
MONTJOY:
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,
MONTJOY:
Before thy most assured overthrow
MONTJOY:
For certainly thou art so near the gulf,
MONTJOY:
Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,
MONTJOY:
The constable desires thee thou wilt mind
MONTJOY:
Thy followers of repentance, that their souls
MONTJOY:
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
MONTJOY:
From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies
MONTJOY:
Must lie and fester.
KING HENRY V:
Who hath sent thee now?
MONTJOY:
The Constable of France.
KING HENRY V:
I pray thee, bear my former answer back
KING HENRY V:
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
KING HENRY V:
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
KING HENRY V:
The man that once did sell the lion's skin
KING HENRY V:
While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
KING HENRY V:
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
KING HENRY V:
Find native graves, upon the which, I trust,
KING HENRY V:
Shall witness live in brass of this day's work
KING HENRY V:
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
KING HENRY V:
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
KING HENRY V:
They shall be famed, for there the sun shall greet them,
KING HENRY V:
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven,
KING HENRY V:
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
KING HENRY V:
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
KING HENRY V:
Mark then abounding valour in our English,
KING HENRY V:
That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,
KING HENRY V:
Break out into a second course of mischief,
KING HENRY V:
Killing in relapse of mortality.
KING HENRY V:
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable
KING HENRY V:
We are but warriors for the working-day,
KING HENRY V:
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
KING HENRY V:
With rainy marching in the painful field,
KING HENRY V:
There's not a piece of feather in our host--
KING HENRY V:
Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
KING HENRY V:
And time hath worn us into slovenry
KING HENRY V:
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim,
KING HENRY V:
And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
KING HENRY V:
They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
KING HENRY V:
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads
KING HENRY V:
And turn them out of service. If they do this,--
KING HENRY V:
As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then
KING HENRY V:
Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour,
KING HENRY V:
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald
KING HENRY V:
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints,
KING HENRY V:
Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,
KING HENRY V:
Shall yield them little, tell the constable.
MONTJOY:
I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well
MONTJOY:
Thou never shalt hear herald any more.
MONTJOY:
Exit
KING HENRY V:
I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.
KING HENRY V:
Enter YORK
YORK:
My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg
YORK:
The leading of the vaward.
KING HENRY V:
Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away
KING HENRY V:
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt
KING HENRY V:
SCENE IV. The field of battle.
KING HENRY V:
Alarum. Excursions. Enter PISTOL, French Soldier, and Boy
PISTOL:
Yield, cur!
French Soldier:
Je pense que vous etes gentilhomme de bonne qualite.
PISTOL:
Qualtitie calmie custure me! Art thou a gentleman?
PISTOL:
what is thy name? discuss.
French Soldier:
O Seigneur Dieu!
PISTOL:
O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman
PISTOL:
Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark,
PISTOL:
O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,
PISTOL:
Except, O signieur, thou do give to me
PISTOL:
Egregious ransom.
French Soldier:
O, prenez misericorde! ayez pitie de moi!
PISTOL:
Moy shall not serve, I will have forty moys,
PISTOL:
Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat
PISTOL:
In drops of crimson blood.
French Soldier:
Est-il impossible d'echapper la force de ton bras?
PISTOL:
Brass, cur!
PISTOL:
Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat,
PISTOL:
Offer'st me brass?
French Soldier:
O pardonnez moi!
PISTOL:
Say'st thou me so? is that a ton of moys?
PISTOL:
Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French
PISTOL:
What is his name.
Boy:
Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?
French Soldier:
Monsieur le Fer.
Boy:
He says his name is Master Fer.
PISTOL:
Master Fer! I'll fer him, and firk him, and ferret
PISTOL:
him: discuss the same in French unto him.
Boy:
I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.
PISTOL:
Bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat.
French Soldier:
Que dit-il, monsieur?
Boy:
Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites vous
Boy:
pret, car ce soldat ici est dispose tout a cette
Boy:
heure de couper votre gorge.
PISTOL:
Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy,
PISTOL:
Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns,
PISTOL:
Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.
French Soldier:
O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me
French Soldier:
pardonner! Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison
French Soldier:
gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents ecus.
PISTOL:
What are his words?
Boy:
He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of
Boy:
a good house, and for his ransom he will give you
Boy:
two hundred crowns.
PISTOL:
Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the crowns will take.
French Soldier:
Petit monsieur, que dit-il?
Boy:
Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner
Boy:
aucun prisonnier, neanmoins, pour les ecus que vous
Boy:
l'avez promis, il est content de vous donner la
Boy:
liberte, le franchisement.
French Soldier:
Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens, et
French Soldier:
je m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre les
French Soldier:
mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,
French Soldier:
vaillant, et tres distingue seigneur d'Angleterre.
PISTOL:
Expound unto me, boy.
Boy:
He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks, and
Boy:
he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into
Boy:
the hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave,
Boy:
valorous, and thrice-worthy signieur of England.
PISTOL:
As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.
PISTOL:
Follow me!
Boy:
Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.
Boy:
Exeunt PISTOL, and French Soldier
Boy:
I did never know so full a voice issue from so
Boy:
empty a heart: but the saying is true 'The empty
Boy:
vessel makes the greatest sound.' Bardolph and Nym
Boy:
had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i'
Boy:
the old play, that every one may pare his nails with
Boy:
a wooden dagger, and they are both hanged, and so
Boy:
would this be, if he durst steal any thing
Boy:
adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, with
Boy:
the luggage of our camp: the French might have a
Boy:
good prey of us, if he knew of it, for there is
Boy:
none to guard it but boys.
Boy:
Exit
Boy:
SCENE V. Another part of the field.
Boy:
Enter Constable, ORLEANS, BOURBON, DAUPHIN, and RAMBURES
Constable:
O diable!
ORLEANS:
O seigneur! le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!
DAUPHIN:
Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all!
DAUPHIN:
Reproach and everlasting shame
DAUPHIN:
Sits mocking in our plumes. O merchante fortune!
DAUPHIN:
Do not run away.
DAUPHIN:
A short alarum
Constable:
Why, all our ranks are broke.
DAUPHIN:
O perdurable shame! let's stab ourselves.
DAUPHIN:
Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?
ORLEANS:
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?
BOURBON:
Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!
BOURBON:
Let us die in honour: once more back again,
BOURBON:
And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
BOURBON:
Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand,
BOURBON:
Like a base pander, hold the chamber-door
BOURBON:
Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,
BOURBON:
His fairest daughter is contaminated.
Constable:
Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now!
Constable:
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.
ORLEANS:
We are enow yet living in the field
ORLEANS:
To smother up the English in our throngs,
ORLEANS:
If any order might be thought upon.
BOURBON:
The devil take order now! I'll to the throng
BOURBON:
Let life be short, else shame will be too long.
BOURBON:
Exeunt
BOURBON:
SCENE VI. Another part of the field.
BOURBON:
Alarums. Enter KING HENRY and forces, EXETER, and others
KING HENRY V:
Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen
KING HENRY V:
But all's not done, yet keep the French the field.
EXETER:
The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.
KING HENRY V:
Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour
KING HENRY V:
I saw him down, thrice up again and fighting,
KING HENRY V:
From helmet to the spur all blood he was.
EXETER:
In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
EXETER:
Larding the plain, and by his bloody side,
EXETER:
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,
EXETER:
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
EXETER:
Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
EXETER:
Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,
EXETER:
And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes
EXETER:
That bloodily did spawn upon his face,
EXETER:
And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!
EXETER:
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven,
EXETER:
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
EXETER:
As in this glorious and well-foughten field
EXETER:
We kept together in our chivalry!'
EXETER:
Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up
EXETER:
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
EXETER:
And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,
EXETER:
Commend my service to me sovereign.'
EXETER:
So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
EXETER:
He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips,
EXETER:
And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd
EXETER:
A testament of noble-ending love.
EXETER:
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
EXETER:
Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd,
EXETER:
But I had not so much of man in me,
EXETER:
And all my mother came into mine eyes
EXETER:
And gave me up to tears.
KING HENRY V:
I blame you not,
KING HENRY V:
For, hearing this, I must perforce compound
KING HENRY V:
With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.
KING HENRY V:
Alarum
KING HENRY V:
But, hark! what new alarum is this same?
KING HENRY V:
The French have reinforced their scatter'd men
KING HENRY V:
Then every soldier kill his prisoners
KING HENRY V:
Give the word through.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt
KING HENRY V:
SCENE VII. Another part of the field.
KING HENRY V:
Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER
FLUELLEN:
Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly
FLUELLEN:
against the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of
FLUELLEN:
knavery, mark you now, as can be offer't, in your
FLUELLEN:
conscience, now, is it not?
GOWER:
'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive, and the
GOWER:
cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done
GOWER:
this slaughter: besides, they have burned and
GOWER:
carried away all that was in the king's tent,
GOWER:
wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every
GOWER:
soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a
GOWER:
gallant king!
FLUELLEN:
Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What
FLUELLEN:
call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!
GOWER:
Alexander the Great.
FLUELLEN:
Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the
FLUELLEN:
great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the
FLUELLEN:
magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase
FLUELLEN:
is a little variations.
GOWER:
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon, his
GOWER:
father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
FLUELLEN:
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I
FLUELLEN:
tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the
FLUELLEN:
'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons
FLUELLEN:
between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,
FLUELLEN:
look you, is both alike. There is a river in
FLUELLEN:
Macedon, and there is also moreover a river at
FLUELLEN:
Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is
FLUELLEN:
out of my prains what is the name of the other
FLUELLEN:
river, but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is
FLUELLEN:
to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you
FLUELLEN:
mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life
FLUELLEN:
is come after it indifferent well, for there is
FLUELLEN:
figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and
FLUELLEN:
you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his
FLUELLEN:
wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his
FLUELLEN:
displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a
FLUELLEN:
little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and
FLUELLEN:
his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.
GOWER:
Our king is not like him in that: he never killed
GOWER:
any of his friends.
FLUELLEN:
It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out
FLUELLEN:
of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
FLUELLEN:
but in the figures and comparisons of it: as
FLUELLEN:
Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his
FLUELLEN:
ales and his cups, so also Harry Monmouth, being in
FLUELLEN:
his right wits and his good judgments, turned away
FLUELLEN:
the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he
FLUELLEN:
was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and
FLUELLEN:
mocks, I have forgot his name.
GOWER:
Sir John Falstaff.
FLUELLEN:
That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.
GOWER:
Here comes his majesty.
GOWER:
Alarum. Enter KING HENRY, and forces, WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, EXETER, and others
KING HENRY V:
I was not angry since I came to France
KING HENRY V:
Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald,
KING HENRY V:
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill
KING HENRY V:
If they will fight with us, bid them come down,
KING HENRY V:
Or void the field, they do offend our sight
KING HENRY V:
If they'll do neither, we will come to them,
KING HENRY V:
And make them skirr away, as swift as stones
KING HENRY V:
Enforced from the old Assyrian slings
KING HENRY V:
Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,
KING HENRY V:
And not a man of them that we shall take
KING HENRY V:
Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
KING HENRY V:
Enter MONTJOY
EXETER:
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
GLOUCESTER:
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
KING HENRY V:
How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not
KING HENRY V:
That I have  fined these bones of mine for ransom?
KING HENRY V:
Comest thou again for ransom?
MONTJOY:
No, great king
MONTJOY:
I come to thee for charitable licence,
MONTJOY:
That we may wander o'er this bloody field
MONTJOY:
To look our dead, and then to bury them,
MONTJOY:
To sort our nobles from our common men.
MONTJOY:
For many of our princes--woe the while!--
MONTJOY:
Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood,
MONTJOY:
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
MONTJOY:
In blood of princes, and their wounded steeds
MONTJOY:
Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
MONTJOY:
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,
MONTJOY:
Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
MONTJOY:
To view the field in safety and dispose
MONTJOY:
Of their dead bodies!
KING HENRY V:
I tell thee truly, herald,
KING HENRY V:
I know not if the day be ours or no,
KING HENRY V:
For yet a many of your horsemen peer
KING HENRY V:
And gallop o'er the field.
MONTJOY:
The day is yours.
KING HENRY V:
Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
KING HENRY V:
What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?
MONTJOY:
They call it Agincourt.
KING HENRY V:
Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
KING HENRY V:
Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
FLUELLEN:
Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your
FLUELLEN:
majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack
FLUELLEN:
Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,
FLUELLEN:
fought a most prave pattle here in France.
KING HENRY V:
They did, Fluellen.
FLUELLEN:
Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is
FLUELLEN:
remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a
FLUELLEN:
garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their
FLUELLEN:
Monmouth caps, which, your majesty know, to this
FLUELLEN:
hour is an honourable badge of the service, and I do
FLUELLEN:
believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek
FLUELLEN:
upon Saint Tavy's day.
KING HENRY V:
I wear it for a memorable honour,
KING HENRY V:
For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.
FLUELLEN:
All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's
FLUELLEN:
Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that
FLUELLEN:
God pless it and preserve it, as long as it pleases
FLUELLEN:
his grace, and his majesty too!
KING HENRY V:
Thanks, good my countryman.
FLUELLEN:
By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman, I care not
FLUELLEN:
who know it, I will confess it to all the 'orld: I
FLUELLEN:
need not to be ashamed of your majesty, praised be
FLUELLEN:
God, so long as your majesty is an honest man.
KING HENRY V:
God keep me so! Our heralds go with him
KING HENRY V:
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead
KING HENRY V:
On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.
KING HENRY V:
Points to WILLIAMS. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy
EXETER:
Soldier, you must come to the king.
KING HENRY V:
Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?
WILLIAMS:
An't please your majesty, 'tis the gage of one that
WILLIAMS:
I should fight withal, if he be alive.
KING HENRY V:
An Englishman?
WILLIAMS:
An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggered
WILLIAMS:
with me last night, who, if alive and ever dare to
WILLIAMS:
challenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a box
WILLIAMS:
o' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,
WILLIAMS:
which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear
WILLIAMS:
if alive, I will strike it out soundly.
KING HENRY V:
What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit this
KING HENRY V:
soldier keep his oath?
FLUELLEN:
He is a craven and a villain else, an't please your
FLUELLEN:
majesty, in my conscience.
KING HENRY V:
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort,
KING HENRY V:
quite from the answer of his degree.
FLUELLEN:
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as
FLUELLEN:
Lucifer and Belzebub himself, it is necessary, look
FLUELLEN:
your grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: if
FLUELLEN:
he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as
FLUELLEN:
arrant a villain and a Jacksauce, as ever his black
FLUELLEN:
shoe trod upon God's ground and his earth, in my
FLUELLEN:
conscience, la!
KING HENRY V:
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.
WILLIAMS:
So I will, my liege, as I live.
KING HENRY V:
Who servest thou under?
WILLIAMS:
Under Captain Gower, my liege.
FLUELLEN:
Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and
FLUELLEN:
literatured in the wars.
KING HENRY V:
Call him hither to me, soldier.
WILLIAMS:
I will, my liege.
WILLIAMS:
Exit
KING HENRY V:
Here, Fluellen, wear thou this favour for me and
KING HENRY V:
stick it in thy cap: when Alencon and myself were
KING HENRY V:
down together, I plucked this glove from his helm
KING HENRY V:
if any man challenge this, he is a friend to
KING HENRY V:
Alencon, and an enemy to our person, if thou
KING HENRY V:
encounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.
FLUELLEN:
Your grace doo's me as great honours as can be
FLUELLEN:
desired in the hearts of his subjects: I would fain
FLUELLEN:
see the man, that has but two legs, that shall find
FLUELLEN:
himself aggrieved at this glove, that is all, but I
FLUELLEN:
would fain see it once, an please God of his grace
FLUELLEN:
that I might see.
KING HENRY V:
Knowest thou Gower?
FLUELLEN:
He is my dear friend, an please you.
KING HENRY V:
Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.
FLUELLEN:
I will fetch him.
FLUELLEN:
Exit
KING HENRY V:
My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,
KING HENRY V:
Follow Fluellen closely at the heels
KING HENRY V:
The glove which I have given him for a favour
KING HENRY V:
May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear,
KING HENRY V:
It is the soldier's, I by bargain should
KING HENRY V:
Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick
KING HENRY V:
If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
KING HENRY V:
By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
KING HENRY V:
Some sudden mischief may arise of it,
KING HENRY V:
For I do know Fluellen valiant
KING HENRY V:
And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,
KING HENRY V:
And quickly will return an injury
KING HENRY V:
Follow and see there be no harm between them.
KING HENRY V:
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt
KING HENRY V:
SCENE VIII. Before KING HENRY'S pavilion.
KING HENRY V:
Enter GOWER and WILLIAMS
WILLIAMS:
I warrant it is to knight you, captain.
WILLIAMS:
Enter FLUELLEN
FLUELLEN:
God's will and his pleasure, captain, I beseech you
FLUELLEN:
now, come apace to the king: there is more good
FLUELLEN:
toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of.
WILLIAMS:
Sir, know you this glove?
FLUELLEN:
Know the glove! I know the glove is glove.
WILLIAMS:
I know this, and thus I challenge it.
WILLIAMS:
Strikes him
FLUELLEN:
'Sblood! an arrant traitor as any is in the
FLUELLEN:
universal world, or in France, or in England!
GOWER:
How now, sir! you villain!
WILLIAMS:
Do you think I'll be forsworn?
FLUELLEN:
Stand away, Captain Gower, I will give treason his
FLUELLEN:
payment into ploughs, I warrant you.
WILLIAMS:
I am no traitor.
FLUELLEN:
That's a lie in thy throat. I charge you in his
FLUELLEN:
majesty's name, apprehend him: he's a friend of the
FLUELLEN:
Duke Alencon's.
FLUELLEN:
Enter WARWICK and GLOUCESTER
WARWICK:
How now, how now! what's the matter?
FLUELLEN:
My Lord of Warwick, here is--praised be God for it!
FLUELLEN:
--a most contagious treason come to light, look
FLUELLEN:
you, as you shall desire in a summer's day. Here is
FLUELLEN:
his majesty.
FLUELLEN:
Enter KING HENRY and EXETER
KING HENRY V:
How now! what's the matter?
FLUELLEN:
My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that,
FLUELLEN:
look your grace, has struck the glove which your
FLUELLEN:
majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon.
WILLIAMS:
My liege, this was my glove, here is the fellow of
WILLIAMS:
it, and he that I gave it to in change promised to
WILLIAMS:
wear it in his cap: I promised to strike him, if he
WILLIAMS:
did: I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I
WILLIAMS:
have been as good as my word.
FLUELLEN:
Your majesty hear now, saving your majesty's
FLUELLEN:
manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy
FLUELLEN:
knave it is: I hope your majesty is pear me
FLUELLEN:
testimony and witness, and will avouchment, that
FLUELLEN:
this is the glove of Alencon, that your majesty is
FLUELLEN:
give me, in your conscience, now?
KING HENRY V:
Give me thy glove, soldier: look, here is the
KING HENRY V:
fellow of it.
KING HENRY V:
'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike,
KING HENRY V:
And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
FLUELLEN:
An please your majesty, let his neck answer for it,
FLUELLEN:
if there is any martial law in the world.
KING HENRY V:
How canst thou make me satisfaction?
WILLIAMS:
All offences, my lord, come from the heart: never
WILLIAMS:
came any from mine that might offend your majesty.
KING HENRY V:
It was ourself thou didst abuse.
WILLIAMS:
Your majesty came not like yourself: you appeared to
WILLIAMS:
me but as a common man, witness the night, your
WILLIAMS:
garments, your lowliness, and what your highness
WILLIAMS:
suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for
WILLIAMS:
your own fault and not mine: for had you been as I
WILLIAMS:
took you for, I made no offence, therefore, I
WILLIAMS:
beseech your highness, pardon me.
KING HENRY V:
Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,
KING HENRY V:
And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow,
KING HENRY V:
And wear it for an honour in thy cap
KING HENRY V:
Till I do challenge it. Give him the crowns
KING HENRY V:
And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.
FLUELLEN:
By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle
FLUELLEN:
enough in his belly. Hold, there is twelve pence
FLUELLEN:
for you, and I pray you to serve Got, and keep you
FLUELLEN:
out of prawls, and prabbles' and quarrels, and
FLUELLEN:
dissensions, and, I warrant you, it is the better for you.
WILLIAMS:
I will none of your money.
FLUELLEN:
It is with a good will, I can tell you, it will
FLUELLEN:
serve you to mend your shoes: come, wherefore should
FLUELLEN:
you be so pashful? your shoes is not so good: 'tis
FLUELLEN:
a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.
FLUELLEN:
Enter an English Herald
KING HENRY V:
Now, herald, are the dead number'd?

Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,

Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.
KING HENRY V:
This note doth tell me of ten thousand French
KING HENRY V:
That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,
KING HENRY V:
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
KING HENRY V:
One hundred twenty six: added to these,
KING HENRY V:
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,
KING HENRY V:
Eight thousand and four hundred, of the which,
KING HENRY V:
Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights
KING HENRY V:
So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
KING HENRY V:
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries,
KING HENRY V:
The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,
KING HENRY V:
And gentlemen of blood and quality.

Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,
KING HENRY V:
Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire
KING HENRY V:
None else of name, and of all other men
KING HENRY V:
But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here,
KING HENRY V:
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
KING HENRY V:
Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,
KING HENRY V:
But in plain shock and even play of battle,
KING HENRY V:
Was ever known so great and little loss
KING HENRY V:
On one part and on the other? Take it, God,
KING HENRY V:
For it is none but thine!
EXETER:
'Tis wonderful!
KING HENRY V:
Come, go we in procession to the village.
KING HENRY V:
And be it death proclaimed through our host
KING HENRY V:
To boast of this or take the praise from God
KING HENRY V:
Which is his only.
FLUELLEN:
Is it not lawful, an please your majesty, to tell
FLUELLEN:
how many is killed?
KING HENRY V:
Yes, captain, but with this acknowledgement,
KING HENRY V:
That God fought for us.
FLUELLEN:
Yes, my conscience, he did us great good.
KING HENRY V:
Do we all holy rites,
KING HENRY V:
Let there be sung 'Non nobis' and 'Te Deum,'
KING HENRY V:
The dead with charity enclosed in clay
KING HENRY V:
And then to Calais, and to England then
KING HENRY V:
Where ne'er from France arrived more happy men.
KING HENRY V:
Exeunt

Enter Chorus
Chorus:
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,
Chorus:
That I may prompt them: and of such as have,
Chorus:
I humbly pray them to admit the excuse
Chorus:
Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
Chorus:
Which cannot in their huge and proper life
Chorus:
Be here presented. Now we bear the king
Chorus:
Toward Calais: grant him there, there seen,
Chorus:
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
Chorus:
Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
Chorus:
Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
Chorus:
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,
Chorus:
Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king
Chorus:
Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,
Chorus:
And solemnly see him set on to London.
Chorus:
So swift a pace hath thought that even now
Chorus:
You may imagine him upon Blackheath,
Chorus:
Where that his lords desire him to have borne
Chorus:
His bruised helmet and his bended sword
Chorus:
Before him through the city: he forbids it,
Chorus:
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride,
Chorus:
Giving full trophy, signal and ostent
Chorus:
Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
Chorus:
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
Chorus:
How London doth pour out her citizens!
Chorus:
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,
Chorus:
Like to the senators of the antique Rome,
Chorus:
With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
Chorus:
Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in
Chorus:
As, by a lower but loving likelihood,
Chorus:
Were now the general of our gracious empress,
Chorus:
As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,
Chorus:
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
Chorus:
How many would the peaceful city quit,
Chorus:
To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,
Chorus:
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him,
Chorus:
As yet the lamentation of the French
Chorus:
Invites the King of England's stay at home,
Chorus:
The emperor's coming in behalf of France,
Chorus:
To order peace between them, and omit
Chorus:
All the occurrences, whatever chanced,
Chorus:
Till Harry's back-return again to France
Chorus:
There must we bring him, and myself have play'd
Chorus:
The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.
Chorus:
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,
Chorus:
After your thoughts, straight back again to France.

GOWER:
Nay, that's right, but why wear you your leek today?
GOWER:
Saint Davy's day is past.
FLUELLEN:
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in
FLUELLEN:
all things: I will tell you, asse my friend,
FLUELLEN:
Captain Gower: the rascally, scald, beggarly,
FLUELLEN:
lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
FLUELLEN:
yourself and all the world know to be no petter
FLUELLEN:
than a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is
FLUELLEN:
come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday,
FLUELLEN:
look you, and bid me eat my leek: it was in place
FLUELLEN:
where I could not breed no contention with him, but
FLUELLEN:
I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see
FLUELLEN:
him once again, and then I will tell him a little
FLUELLEN:
piece of my desires.
FLUELLEN:
Enter PISTOL
GOWER:
Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.
FLUELLEN:
'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his
FLUELLEN:
turkey-cocks. God pless you, Aunchient Pistol! you
FLUELLEN:
scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you!
PISTOL:
Ha! art thou bedlam? dost thou thirst, base Trojan,
PISTOL:
To have me fold up Parca's fatal web?
PISTOL:
Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.
FLUELLEN:
I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at my
FLUELLEN:
desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat,
FLUELLEN:
look you, this leek: because, look you, you do not
FLUELLEN:
love it, nor your affections and your appetites and
FLUELLEN:
your digestions doo's not agree with it, I would
FLUELLEN:
desire you to eat it.
PISTOL:
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
FLUELLEN:
There is one goat for you.
FLUELLEN:
Strikes him
FLUELLEN:
Will you be so good, scauld knave, as eat it?
PISTOL:
Base Trojan, thou shalt die.
FLUELLEN:
You say very true, scauld knave, when God's will is
FLUELLEN:
I will desire you to live in the mean time, and eat
FLUELLEN:
your victuals: come, there is sauce for it.
FLUELLEN:
Strikes him
FLUELLEN:
You called me yesterday mountain-squire, but I will
FLUELLEN:
make you to-day a squire of low degree. I pray you,
FLUELLEN:
fall to: if you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.
GOWER:
Enough, captain: you have astonished him.
FLUELLEN:
I say, I will make him eat some part of my leek, or
FLUELLEN:
I will peat his pate four days. Bite, I pray you, it
FLUELLEN:
is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb.
PISTOL:
Must I bite?
FLUELLEN:
Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question
FLUELLEN:
too, and ambiguities.
PISTOL:
By this leek, I will most horribly revenge: I eat
PISTOL:
and eat, I swear--
FLUELLEN:
Eat, I pray you: will you have some more sauce to
FLUELLEN:
your leek? there is not enough leek to swear by.
PISTOL:
Quiet thy cudgel, thou dost see I eat.
FLUELLEN:
Much good do you, scauld knave, heartily. Nay, pray
FLUELLEN:
you, throw none away, the skin is good for your
FLUELLEN:
broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to see leeks
FLUELLEN:
hereafter, I pray you, mock at 'em, that is all.
PISTOL:
Good.
FLUELLEN:
Ay, leeks is good: hold you, there is a groat to
FLUELLEN:
heal your pate.
PISTOL:
Me a groat!
FLUELLEN:
Yes, verily and in truth, you shall take it, or I
FLUELLEN:
have another leek in my pocket, which you shall eat.
PISTOL:
I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.
FLUELLEN:
If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in cudgels
FLUELLEN:
you shall be a woodmonger, and buy nothing of me but
FLUELLEN:
cudgels. God b' wi' you, and keep you, and heal your pate.
FLUELLEN:
Exit
PISTOL:
All hell shall stir for this.
GOWER:
Go, go, you are a counterfeit cowardly knave. Will
GOWER:
you mock at an ancient tradition, begun upon an
GOWER:
honourable respect, and worn as a memorable trophy of
GOWER:
predeceased valour and dare not avouch in your deeds
GOWER:
any of your words? I have seen you gleeking and
GOWER:
galling at this gentleman twice or thrice. You
GOWER:
thought, because he could not speak English in the
GOWER:
native garb, he could not therefore handle an
GOWER:
English cudgel: you find it otherwise, and
GOWER:
henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good
GOWER:
English condition. Fare ye well.

Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?
PISTOL:
News have I, that my Nell is dead i' the spital
PISTOL:
Of malady of France,

And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
PISTOL:
Old I do wax, and from my weary limbs
PISTOL:
Honour is cudgelled. Well, bawd I'll turn,
PISTOL:
And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.

To England will I steal, and there I'll steal

And patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars,

And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.

Enter, at one door KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD,  GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and other Lords,  at another, the FRENCH KING, QUEEN ISABEL, the  PRINCESS KATHARINE, ALICE and other Ladies, the DUKE of BURGUNDY, and his train
KING HENRY V:
Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!
KING HENRY V:
Unto our brother France, and to our sister,
KING HENRY V:
Health and fair time of day, joy and good wishes
KING HENRY V:
To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine,
KING HENRY V:
And, as a branch and member of this royalty,
KING HENRY V:
By whom this great assembly is contrived,
KING HENRY V:
We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy,
KING HENRY V:
And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!
KING OF FRANCE:
Right joyous are we to behold your face,
KING OF FRANCE:
Most worthy brother England, fairly met
KING OF FRANCE:
So are you, princes English, every one.
QUEEN ISABEL:
So happy be the issue, brother England,
QUEEN ISABEL:
Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,
QUEEN ISABEL:
As we are now glad to behold your eyes,
QUEEN ISABEL:
Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them
QUEEN ISABEL:
Against the French, that met them in their bent,
QUEEN ISABEL:
The fatal balls of murdering basilisks
QUEEN ISABEL:
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,
QUEEN ISABEL:
Have lost their quality, and that this day
QUEEN ISABEL:
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
KING HENRY V:
To cry amen to that, thus we appear.
QUEEN ISABEL:
You English princes all, I do salute you.
BURGUNDY:
My duty to you both, on equal love,
BURGUNDY:
Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd,
BURGUNDY:
With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,
BURGUNDY:
To bring your most imperial majesties
BURGUNDY:
Unto this bar and royal interview,
BURGUNDY:
Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.
BURGUNDY:
Since then my office hath so far prevail'd
BURGUNDY:
That, face to face and royal eye to eye,
BURGUNDY:
You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,
BURGUNDY:
If I demand, before this royal view,
BURGUNDY:
What rub or what impediment there is,
BURGUNDY:
Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,
BURGUNDY:
Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,
BURGUNDY:
Should not in this best garden of the world
BURGUNDY:
Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
BURGUNDY:
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,
BURGUNDY:
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
BURGUNDY:
Corrupting in its own fertility.
BURGUNDY:
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,
BURGUNDY:
Unpruned dies, her hedges even-pleach'd,
BURGUNDY:
Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,
BURGUNDY:
Put forth disorder'd twigs, her fallow leas
BURGUNDY:
The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory
BURGUNDY:
Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
BURGUNDY:
That should deracinate such savagery,
BURGUNDY:
The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
BURGUNDY:
The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,
BURGUNDY:
Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,
BURGUNDY:
Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
BURGUNDY:
But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,
BURGUNDY:
Losing both beauty and utility.
BURGUNDY:
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,
BURGUNDY:
Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,
BURGUNDY:
Even so our houses and ourselves and children
BURGUNDY:
Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,
BURGUNDY:
The sciences that should become our country,
BURGUNDY:
But grow like savages,--as soldiers will
BURGUNDY:
That nothing do but meditate on blood,--
BURGUNDY:
To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire
BURGUNDY:
And every thing that seems unnatural.
BURGUNDY:
Which to reduce into our former favour
BURGUNDY:
You are assembled: and my speech entreats
BURGUNDY:
That I may know the let, why gentle Peace
BURGUNDY:
Should not expel these inconveniences
BURGUNDY:
And bless us with her former qualities.
KING HENRY V:
If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,
KING HENRY V:
Whose want gives growth to the imperfections
KING HENRY V:
Which you have cited, you must buy that peace
KING HENRY V:
With full accord to all our just demands,
KING HENRY V:
Whose tenors and particular effects
KING HENRY V:
You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.
BURGUNDY:
The king hath heard them, to the which as yet
BURGUNDY:
There is no answer made.
KING HENRY V:
Well then the peace,
KING HENRY V:
Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.
KING OF FRANCE:
I have but with a cursorary eye
KING OF FRANCE:
O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace
KING OF FRANCE:
To appoint some of your council presently
KING OF FRANCE:
To sit with us once more, with better heed
KING OF FRANCE:
To re-survey them, we will suddenly
KING OF FRANCE:
Pass our accept and peremptory answer.
KING HENRY V:
Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,
KING HENRY V:
And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,
KING HENRY V:
Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king,
KING HENRY V:
And take with you free power to ratify,
KING HENRY V:
Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best
KING HENRY V:
Shall see advantageable for our dignity,
KING HENRY V:
Any thing in or out of our demands,
KING HENRY V:
And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,
KING HENRY V:
Go with the princes, or stay here with us?
QUEEN ISABEL:
Our gracious brother, I will go with them
QUEEN ISABEL:
Haply a woman's voice may do some good,
QUEEN ISABEL:
When articles too nicely urged be stood on.
KING HENRY V:
Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us
KING HENRY V:
She is our capital demand, comprised
KING HENRY V:
Within the fore-rank of our articles.
QUEEN ISABEL:
She hath good leave.
QUEEN ISABEL:
Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE
KING HENRY V:
Fair Katharine, and most fair,
KING HENRY V:
Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
KING HENRY V:
Such as will enter at a lady's ear
KING HENRY V:
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
KATHARINE:
Your majesty shall mock at me, I cannot speak your England.
KING HENRY V:
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with
KING HENRY V:
your French heart, I will be glad to hear you
KING HENRY V:
confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do
KING HENRY V:
you like me, Kate?
KATHARINE:
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'
KING HENRY V:
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
KATHARINE:
Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?
ALICE:
Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.
KING HENRY V:
I said so, dear Katharine, and I must not blush to
KING HENRY V:
affirm it.
KATHARINE:
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de
KATHARINE:
tromperies.
KING HENRY V:
What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men
KING HENRY V:
are full of deceits?
ALICE:
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
ALICE:
deceits: dat is de princess.
KING HENRY V:
The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,
KING HENRY V:
Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am
KING HENRY V:
glad thou canst speak no better English, for, if
KING HENRY V:
thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king
KING HENRY V:
that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my
KING HENRY V:
crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but
KING HENRY V:
directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me
KING HENRY V:
farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out
KING HENRY V:
my suit. Give me your answer, i' faith, do: and so
KING HENRY V:
clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?
KATHARINE:
Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.
KING HENRY V:
Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for
KING HENRY V:
your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I
KING HENRY V:
have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I
KING HENRY V:
have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable
KING HENRY V:
measure in strength. If I could win a lady at
KING HENRY V:
leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my
KING HENRY V:
armour on my back, under the correction of bragging
KING HENRY V:
be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.
KING HENRY V:
Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse
KING HENRY V:
for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and
KING HENRY V:
sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,
KING HENRY V:
Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
KING HENRY V:
eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation,
KING HENRY V:
only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,
KING HENRY V:
nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a
KING HENRY V:
fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth
KING HENRY V:
sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love
KING HENRY V:
of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy
KING HENRY V:
cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst
KING HENRY V:
love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee
KING HENRY V:
that I shall die, is true, but for thy love, by the
KING HENRY V:
Lord, no, yet I love thee too. And while thou
KING HENRY V:
livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and
KING HENRY V:
uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee
KING HENRY V:
right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other
KING HENRY V:
places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that
KING HENRY V:
can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do
KING HENRY V:
always reason themselves out again. What! a
KING HENRY V:
speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad. A
KING HENRY V:
good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a
KING HENRY V:
black beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow
KING HENRY V:
bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax
KING HENRY V:
hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the
KING HENRY V:
moon, or, rather, the sun, and not the moon, for it
KING HENRY V:
shines bright and never changes, but keeps his
KING HENRY V:
course truly. If thou would have such a one, take
KING HENRY V:
me, and take me, take a soldier, take a soldier,
KING HENRY V:
take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?
KING HENRY V:
speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
KATHARINE:
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
KING HENRY V:
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of
KING HENRY V:
France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love
KING HENRY V:
the friend of France, for I love France so well that
KING HENRY V:
I will not part with a village of it, I will have it
KING HENRY V:
all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am
KING HENRY V:
yours, then yours is France and you are mine.
KATHARINE:
I cannot tell vat is dat.
KING HENRY V:
No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am
KING HENRY V:
sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married
KING HENRY V:
wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook
KING HENRY V:
off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand
KING HENRY V:
vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what
KING HENRY V:
then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est
KING HENRY V:
France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,
KING HENRY V:
Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much
KING HENRY V:
more French: I shall never move thee in French,
KING HENRY V:
unless it be to laugh at me.
KATHARINE:
Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il
KATHARINE:
est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.
KING HENRY V:
No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my
KING HENRY V:
tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs
KING HENRY V:
be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou
KING HENRY V:
understand thus much English, canst thou love me?
KATHARINE:
I cannot tell.
KING HENRY V:
Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask
KING HENRY V:
them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,
KING HENRY V:
when you come into your closet, you'll question this
KING HENRY V:
gentlewoman about me, and I know, Kate, you will to
KING HENRY V:
her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
KING HENRY V:
your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully, the
KING HENRY V:
rather, gentle princess, because I love thee
KING HENRY V:
cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a
KING HENRY V:
saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get
KING HENRY V:
thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs
KING HENRY V:
prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,
KING HENRY V:
between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a
KING HENRY V:
boy, half French, half English, that shall go to
KING HENRY V:
Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?
KING HENRY V:
shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair
KING HENRY V:
flower-de-luce?
KATHARINE:
I do not know dat
KING HENRY V:
No, 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do
KING HENRY V:
but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your
KING HENRY V:
French part of such a boy, and for my English moiety
KING HENRY V:
take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer
KING HENRY V:
you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher
KING HENRY V:
et devin deesse?
KATHARINE:
Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de
KATHARINE:
most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
KING HENRY V:
Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in
KING HENRY V:
true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I
KING HENRY V:
dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood begins to
KING HENRY V:
flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor
KING HENRY V:
and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew
KING HENRY V:
my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars
KING HENRY V:
when he got me: therefore was I created with a
KING HENRY V:
stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when
KING HENRY V:
I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,
KING HENRY V:
Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear
KING HENRY V:
my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of
KING HENRY V:
beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou
KING HENRY V:
hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou
KING HENRY V:
shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better
KING HENRY V:
and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you
KING HENRY V:
have me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the
KING HENRY V:
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress,
KING HENRY V:
take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am
KING HENRY V:
thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
KING HENRY V:
ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is
KING HENRY V:
thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry
KING HENRY V:
Plantagenet is thine,' who though I speak it before
KING HENRY V:
his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,
KING HENRY V:
thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.
KING HENRY V:
Come, your answer in broken music, for thy voice is
KING HENRY V:
music and thy English broken, therefore, queen of
KING HENRY V:
all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken
KING HENRY V:
English, wilt thou have me?
KATHARINE:
Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
KING HENRY V:
Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please
KING HENRY V:
him, Kate.
KATHARINE:
Den it sall also content me.
KING HENRY V:
Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.
KATHARINE:
Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je
KATHARINE:
ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en
KATHARINE:
baisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne
KATHARINE:
serviteur, excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon
KATHARINE:
tres-puissant seigneur.
KING HENRY V:
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
KATHARINE:
Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant
KATHARINE:
leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.
KING HENRY V:
Madam my interpreter, what says she?
ALICE:
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
ALICE:
France,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.
KING HENRY V:
To kiss.
ALICE:
Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.
KING HENRY V:
It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss
KING HENRY V:
before they are married, would she say?
ALICE:
Oui, vraiment.
KING HENRY V:
O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear
KING HENRY V:
Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak
KING HENRY V:
list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of
KING HENRY V:
manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our
KING HENRY V:
places stops the mouth of all find-faults, as I will
KING HENRY V:
do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your
KING HENRY V:
country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently
KING HENRY V:
and yielding.
KING HENRY V:
Kissing her
KING HENRY V:
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is
KING HENRY V:
more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
KING HENRY V:
tongues of the French council, and they should
KING HENRY V:
sooner persuade Harry of England than a general
KING HENRY V:
petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.
KING HENRY V:
Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other Lords
BURGUNDY:
God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you
BURGUNDY:
our princess English?
KING HENRY V:
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how
KING HENRY V:
perfectly I love her, and that is good English.
BURGUNDY:
Is she not apt?
KING HENRY V:
Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not
KING HENRY V:
smooth, so that, having neither the voice nor the
KING HENRY V:
heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up
KING HENRY V:
the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in
KING HENRY V:
his true likeness.
BURGUNDY:
Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you
BURGUNDY:
for that. If you would conjure in her, you must
BURGUNDY:
make a circle, if conjure up love in her in his true
BURGUNDY:
likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you
BURGUNDY:
blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the
BURGUNDY:
virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the
BURGUNDY:
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
BURGUNDY:
self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid
BURGUNDY:
to consign to.
KING HENRY V:
Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.
BURGUNDY:
They are then excused, my lord, when they see not
BURGUNDY:
what they do.
KING HENRY V:
Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
BURGUNDY:
I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will
BURGUNDY:
teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well
BURGUNDY:
summered and warm kept, are like flies at
BURGUNDY:
Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their
BURGUNDY:
eyes, and then they will endure handling, which
BURGUNDY:
before would not abide looking on.
KING HENRY V:
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer,
KING HENRY V:
and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the
KING HENRY V:
latter end and she must be blind too.
BURGUNDY:
As love is, my lord, before it loves.
KING HENRY V:
It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for
KING HENRY V:
my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city
KING HENRY V:
for one fair French maid that stands in my way.
FRENCH KING:
Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities
FRENCH KING:
turned into a maid, for they are all girdled with
FRENCH KING:
maiden walls that war hath never entered.
KING HENRY V:
Shall Kate be my wife?
FRENCH KING:
So please you.
KING HENRY V:
I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may
KING HENRY V:
wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for
KING HENRY V:
my wish shall show me the way to my will.
FRENCH KING:
We have consented to all terms of reason.
KING HENRY V:
Is't so, my lords of England?
WESTMORELAND:
The king hath granted every article
WESTMORELAND:
His daughter first, and then in sequel all,
WESTMORELAND:
According to their firm proposed natures.
EXETER:
Only he hath not yet subscribed this
EXETER:
Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,
EXETER:
having any occasion to write for matter of grant,
EXETER:
shall name your highness in this form and with this
EXETER:
addition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi
EXETER:
d'Angleterre, Heritier de France, and thus in
EXETER:
Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex
EXETER:
Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.
FRENCH KING:
Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,
FRENCH KING:
But your request shall make me let it pass.
KING HENRY V:
I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,
KING HENRY V:
Let that one article rank with the rest,
KING HENRY V:
And thereupon give me your daughter.
FRENCH KING:
Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up
FRENCH KING:
Issue to me, that the contending kingdoms
FRENCH KING:
Of France and England, whose very shores look pale
FRENCH KING:
With envy of each other's happiness,
FRENCH KING:
May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction
FRENCH KING:
Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
FRENCH KING:
In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance
FRENCH KING:
His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.
ALL:
Amen!
KING HENRY V:
Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,
KING HENRY V:
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
KING HENRY V:
Flourish
QUEEN ISABEL:
God, the best maker of all marriages,
QUEEN ISABEL:
Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!
QUEEN ISABEL:
As man and wife, being two, are one in love,
QUEEN ISABEL:
So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,
QUEEN ISABEL:
That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,
QUEEN ISABEL:
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,
QUEEN ISABEL:
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,
QUEEN ISABEL:
To make divorce of their incorporate league,
QUEEN ISABEL:
That English may as French, French Englishmen,
QUEEN ISABEL:
Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
ALL:
Amen!
KING HENRY V:
Prepare we for our marriage--on which day,
KING HENRY V:
My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,
KING HENRY V:
And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.
KING HENRY V:
Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me,
KING HENRY V:
And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!
KING HENRY V:
Sennet. Exeunt
KING HENRY V:
