OCTAVIUS:
ACT I
OCTAVIUS:
SCENE I. King Lear's palace.
OCTAVIUS:
Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND
KENT:
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
KENT:
Albany than Cornwall.
GLOUCESTER:
It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
GLOUCESTER:
division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
GLOUCESTER:
the dukes he values most, for equalities are so
GLOUCESTER:
weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
GLOUCESTER:
of either's moiety.
KENT:
Is not this your son, my lord?
GLOUCESTER:
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
GLOUCESTER:
so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
GLOUCESTER:
brazed to it.
KENT:
I cannot conceive you.
GLOUCESTER:
Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
GLOUCESTER:
she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
GLOUCESTER:
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
GLOUCESTER:
Do you smell a fault?
KENT:
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
KENT:
being so proper.
GLOUCESTER:
But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
GLOUCESTER:
elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account
GLOUCESTER:
though this knave came something saucily into the
GLOUCESTER:
world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
GLOUCESTER:
fair, there was good sport at his making, and the
GLOUCESTER:
whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
GLOUCESTER:
noble gentleman, Edmund?
EDMUND:
No, my lord.
GLOUCESTER:
My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
GLOUCESTER:
honourable friend.
EDMUND:
My services to your lordship.
KENT:
I must love you, and sue to know you better.
EDMUND:
Sir, I shall study deserving.
GLOUCESTER:
He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
GLOUCESTER:
again. The king is coming.
GLOUCESTER:
Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants
KING LEAR:
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
GLOUCESTER:
I shall, my liege.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
KING LEAR:
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
KING LEAR:
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
KING LEAR:
In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
KING LEAR:
To shake all cares and business from our age,
KING LEAR:
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
KING LEAR:
Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
KING LEAR:
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
KING LEAR:
We have this hour a constant will to publish
KING LEAR:
Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
KING LEAR:
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
KING LEAR:
Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
KING LEAR:
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
KING LEAR:
And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
KING LEAR:
Since now we will divest us both of rule,
KING LEAR:
Interest of territory, cares of state,--
KING LEAR:
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
KING LEAR:
That we our largest bounty may extend
KING LEAR:
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
KING LEAR:
Our eldest-born, speak first.
GONERIL:
Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter,
GONERIL:
Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty,
GONERIL:
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,
GONERIL:
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour,
GONERIL:
As much as child e'er loved, or father found,
GONERIL:
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable,
GONERIL:
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
CORDELIA:
[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?
CORDELIA:
Love, and be silent.
LEAR:
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
LEAR:
With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
LEAR:
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
LEAR:
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
LEAR:
Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
LEAR:
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
REGAN:
Sir, I am made
REGAN:
Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
REGAN:
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
REGAN:
I find she names my very deed of love,
REGAN:
Only she comes too short: that I profess
REGAN:
Myself an enemy to all other joys,
REGAN:
Which the most precious square of sense possesses,
REGAN:
And find I am alone felicitate
REGAN:
In your dear highness' love.
CORDELIA:
[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!
CORDELIA:
And yet not so, since, I am sure, my love's
CORDELIA:
More richer than my tongue.
KING LEAR:
To thee and thine hereditary ever
KING LEAR:
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
KING LEAR:
No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
KING LEAR:
Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
KING LEAR:
Although the last, not least, to whose young love
KING LEAR:
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
KING LEAR:
Strive to be interess'd, what can you say to draw
KING LEAR:
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
CORDELIA:
Nothing, my lord.
KING LEAR:
Nothing!
CORDELIA:
Nothing.
KING LEAR:
Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
CORDELIA:
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
CORDELIA:
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
CORDELIA:
According to my bond, nor more nor less.
KING LEAR:
How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
KING LEAR:
Lest it may mar your fortunes.
CORDELIA:
Good my lord,
CORDELIA:
You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
CORDELIA:
Return those duties back as are right fit,
CORDELIA:
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
CORDELIA:
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
CORDELIA:
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
CORDELIA:
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
CORDELIA:
Half my love with him, half my care and duty
CORDELIA:
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
CORDELIA:
To love my father all.
KING LEAR:
But goes thy heart with this?
CORDELIA:
Ay, good my lord.
KING LEAR:
So young, and so untender?
CORDELIA:
So young, my lord, and true.
KING LEAR:
Let it be so, thy truth, then, be thy dower
KING LEAR:
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
KING LEAR:
The mysteries of Hecate, and the night,
KING LEAR:
By all the operation of the orbs
KING LEAR:
From whom we do exist, and cease to be,
KING LEAR:
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
KING LEAR:
Propinquity and property of blood,
KING LEAR:
And as a stranger to my heart and me
KING LEAR:
Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
KING LEAR:
Or he that makes his generation messes
KING LEAR:
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
KING LEAR:
Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
KING LEAR:
As thou my sometime daughter.
KENT:
Good my liege,--
KING LEAR:
Peace, Kent!
KING LEAR:
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
KING LEAR:
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
KING LEAR:
On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
KING LEAR:
So be my grave my peace, as here I give
KING LEAR:
Her father's heart from her! Call France, who stirs?
KING LEAR:
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
KING LEAR:
With my two daughters' dowers digest this third
KING LEAR:
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
KING LEAR:
I do invest you jointly with my power,
KING LEAR:
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
KING LEAR:
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
KING LEAR:
With reservation of an hundred knights,
KING LEAR:
By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
KING LEAR:
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
KING LEAR:
The name, and all the additions to a king,
KING LEAR:
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
KING LEAR:
Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
KING LEAR:
This coronet part betwixt you.
KING LEAR:
Giving the crown
KENT:
Royal Lear,
KENT:
Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
KENT:
Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
KENT:
As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--
KING LEAR:
The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.
KENT:
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
KENT:
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
KENT:
When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
KENT:
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
KENT:
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
KENT:
When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom,
KENT:
And, in thy best consideration, cheque
KENT:
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
KENT:
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
KENT:
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
KENT:
Reverbs no hollowness.
KING LEAR:
Kent, on thy life, no more.
KENT:
My life I never held but as a pawn
KENT:
To wage against thy enemies, nor fear to lose it,
KENT:
Thy safety being the motive.
KING LEAR:
Out of my sight!
KENT:
See better, Lear, and let me still remain
KENT:
The true blank of thine eye.
KING LEAR:
Now, by Apollo,--
KENT:
Now, by Apollo, king,
KENT:
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
KING LEAR:
O, vassal! miscreant!
KING LEAR:
Laying his hand on his sword
CORNWALL:
Dear sir, forbear.
KENT:
Do
KENT:
Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
KENT:
Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom,
KENT:
Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
KENT:
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
KING LEAR:
Hear me, recreant!
KING LEAR:
On thine allegiance, hear me!
KING LEAR:
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
KING LEAR:
Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
KING LEAR:
To come between our sentence and our power,
KING LEAR:
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
KING LEAR:
Our potency made good, take thy reward.
KING LEAR:
Five days we do allot thee, for provision
KING LEAR:
To shield thee from diseases of the world,
KING LEAR:
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
KING LEAR:
Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
KING LEAR:
Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
KING LEAR:
The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
KING LEAR:
This shall not be revoked.
KENT:
Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
KENT:
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
KENT:
To CORDELIA
KENT:
The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
KENT:
That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
KENT:
To REGAN and GONERIL
KENT:
And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
KENT:
That good effects may spring from words of love.
KENT:
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu,
KENT:
He'll shape his old course in a country new.
KENT:
Exit
KENT:
Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants
GLOUCESTER:
Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
KING LEAR:
My lord of Burgundy.
KING LEAR:
We first address towards you, who with this king
KING LEAR:
Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
KING LEAR:
Will you require in present dower with her,
KING LEAR:
Or cease your quest of love?
BURGUNDY:
Most royal majesty,
BURGUNDY:
I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
BURGUNDY:
Nor will you tender less.
KING LEAR:
Right noble Burgundy,
KING LEAR:
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so,
KING LEAR:
But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands
KING LEAR:
If aught within that little seeming substance,
KING LEAR:
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
KING LEAR:
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
KING LEAR:
She's there, and she is yours.
BURGUNDY:
I know no answer.
KING LEAR:
Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
KING LEAR:
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
KING LEAR:
Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
KING LEAR:
Take her, or leave her?
BURGUNDY:
Pardon me, royal sir,
BURGUNDY:
Election makes not up on such conditions.
KING LEAR:
Then leave her, sir, for, by the power that made me,
KING LEAR:
I tell you all her wealth.
KING LEAR:
To KING OF FRANCE
KING LEAR:
For you, great king,
KING LEAR:
I would not from your love make such a stray,
KING LEAR:
To match you where I hate, therefore beseech you
KING LEAR:
To avert your liking a more worthier way
KING LEAR:
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
KING LEAR:
Almost to acknowledge hers.
KING OF FRANCE:
This is most strange,
KING OF FRANCE:
That she, that even but now was your best object,
KING OF FRANCE:
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
KING OF FRANCE:
Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
KING OF FRANCE:
Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
KING OF FRANCE:
So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
KING OF FRANCE:
Must be of such unnatural degree,
KING OF FRANCE:
That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
KING OF FRANCE:
Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
KING OF FRANCE:
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
KING OF FRANCE:
Could never plant in me.
CORDELIA:
I yet beseech your majesty,--
CORDELIA:
If for I want that glib and oily art,
CORDELIA:
To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,
CORDELIA:
I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
CORDELIA:
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
CORDELIA:
No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
CORDELIA:
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour,
CORDELIA:
But even for want of that for which I am richer,
CORDELIA:
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
CORDELIA:
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
CORDELIA:
Hath lost me in your liking.
KING LEAR:
Better thou
KING LEAR:
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
KING OF FRANCE:
Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
KING OF FRANCE:
Which often leaves the history unspoke
KING OF FRANCE:
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
KING OF FRANCE:
What say you to the lady? Love's not love
KING OF FRANCE:
When it is mingled with regards that stand
KING OF FRANCE:
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
KING OF FRANCE:
She is herself a dowry.
BURGUNDY:
Royal Lear,
BURGUNDY:
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
BURGUNDY:
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
BURGUNDY:
Duchess of Burgundy.
KING LEAR:
Nothing: I have sworn, I am firm.
BURGUNDY:
I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
BURGUNDY:
That you must lose a husband.
CORDELIA:
Peace be with Burgundy!
CORDELIA:
Since that respects of fortune are his love,
CORDELIA:
I shall not be his wife.
KING OF FRANCE:
Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor,
KING OF FRANCE:
Most choice, forsaken, and most loved, despised!
KING OF FRANCE:
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon
KING OF FRANCE:
Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
KING OF FRANCE:
Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
KING OF FRANCE:
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
KING OF FRANCE:
Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
KING OF FRANCE:
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France
KING OF FRANCE:
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
KING OF FRANCE:
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
KING OF FRANCE:
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind
KING OF FRANCE:
Thou losest here, a better where to find.
KING LEAR:
Thou hast her, France: let her be thine, for we
KING LEAR:
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
KING LEAR:
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
KING LEAR:
Without our grace, our love, our benison.
KING LEAR:
Come, noble Burgundy.
KING LEAR:
Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA
KING OF FRANCE:
Bid farewell to your sisters.
CORDELIA:
The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
CORDELIA:
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are,
CORDELIA:
And like a sister am most loath to call
CORDELIA:
Your faults as they are named. Use well our father
CORDELIA:
To your professed bosoms I commit him
CORDELIA:
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
CORDELIA:
I would prefer him to a better place.
CORDELIA:
So, farewell to you both.
REGAN:
Prescribe not us our duties.
GONERIL:
Let your study
GONERIL:
Be to content your lord, who hath received you
GONERIL:
At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
GONERIL:
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
CORDELIA:
Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides
CORDELIA:
Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
CORDELIA:
Well may you prosper!
KING OF FRANCE:
Come, my fair Cordelia.
KING OF FRANCE:
Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA
GONERIL:
Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
GONERIL:
most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
GONERIL:
father will hence to-night.
REGAN:
That's most certain, and with you, next month with us.
GONERIL:
You see how full of changes his age is, the
GONERIL:
observation we have made of it hath not been
GONERIL:
little: he always loved our sister most, and
GONERIL:
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
GONERIL:
appears too grossly.
REGAN:
'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
REGAN:
but slenderly known himself.
GONERIL:
The best and soundest of his time hath been but
GONERIL:
rash, then must we look to receive from his age,
GONERIL:
not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
GONERIL:
condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
GONERIL:
that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
REGAN:
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
REGAN:
him as this of Kent's banishment.
GONERIL:
There is further compliment of leavetaking
GONERIL:
between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
GONERIL:
together: if our father carry authority with
GONERIL:
such dispositions as he bears, this last
GONERIL:
surrender of his will but offend us.
REGAN:
We shall further think on't.
GONERIL:
We must do something, and i' the heat.
GONERIL:
Exeunt
GONERIL:
SCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle.
GONERIL:
Enter EDMUND, with a letter
EDMUND:
Thou, nature, art my goddess, to thy law
EDMUND:
My services are bound. Wherefore should I
EDMUND:
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
EDMUND:
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
EDMUND:
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
EDMUND:
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
EDMUND:
When my dimensions are as well compact,
EDMUND:
My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
EDMUND:
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
EDMUND:
With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
EDMUND:
Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
EDMUND:
More composition and fierce quality
EDMUND:
Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
EDMUND:
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
EDMUND:
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
EDMUND:
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land
EDMUND:
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
EDMUND:
As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
EDMUND:
Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
EDMUND:
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
EDMUND:
Shall top the legitimate. I grow, I prosper
EDMUND:
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
EDMUND:
Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
GLOUCESTER:
And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!
GLOUCESTER:
Confined to exhibition! All this done
GLOUCESTER:
Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?
EDMUND:
So please your lordship, none.
EDMUND:
Putting up the letter
GLOUCESTER:
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
EDMUND:
I know no news, my lord.
GLOUCESTER:
What paper were you reading?
EDMUND:
Nothing, my lord.
GLOUCESTER:
No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of
GLOUCESTER:
it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
GLOUCESTER:
not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,
GLOUCESTER:
if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
EDMUND:
I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
EDMUND:
from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read,
EDMUND:
and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
EDMUND:
fit for your o'er-looking.
GLOUCESTER:
Give me the letter, sir.
EDMUND:
I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
EDMUND:
contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
GLOUCESTER:
Let's see, let's see.
EDMUND:
I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
EDMUND:
this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
GLOUCESTER:
[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makes
GLOUCESTER:
the world bitter to the best of our times, keeps
GLOUCESTER:
our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
GLOUCESTER:
them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
GLOUCESTER:
in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not
GLOUCESTER:
as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
GLOUCESTER:
me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
GLOUCESTER:
would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
GLOUCESTER:
revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
GLOUCESTER:
brother,	EDGAR.'
GLOUCESTER:
Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you
GLOUCESTER:
should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!
GLOUCESTER:
Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
GLOUCESTER:
to breed it in?--When came this to you? who
GLOUCESTER:
brought it?
EDMUND:
It was not brought me, my lord, there's the
EDMUND:
cunning of it, I found it thrown in at the
EDMUND:
casement of my closet.
GLOUCESTER:
You know the character to be your brother's?
EDMUND:
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
EDMUND:
it were his, but, in respect of that, I would
EDMUND:
fain think it were not.
GLOUCESTER:
It is his.
EDMUND:
It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is
EDMUND:
not in the contents.
GLOUCESTER:
Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
EDMUND:
Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
EDMUND:
maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
EDMUND:
and fathers declining, the father should be as
EDMUND:
ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
GLOUCESTER:
O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
GLOUCESTER:
letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
GLOUCESTER:
brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
GLOUCESTER:
seek him, I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!
GLOUCESTER:
Where is he?
EDMUND:
I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
EDMUND:
you to suspend your indignation against my
EDMUND:
brother till you can derive from him better
EDMUND:
testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
EDMUND:
course, where, if you violently proceed against
EDMUND:
him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
EDMUND:
gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
EDMUND:
heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
EDMUND:
for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
EDMUND:
affection to your honour, and to no further
EDMUND:
pretence of danger.
GLOUCESTER:
Think you so?
EDMUND:
If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
EDMUND:
where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
EDMUND:
auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and
EDMUND:
that without any further delay than this very evening.
GLOUCESTER:
He cannot be such a monster--
EDMUND:
Nor is not, sure.
GLOUCESTER:
To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
GLOUCESTER:
loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
GLOUCESTER:
out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
GLOUCESTER:
business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
GLOUCESTER:
myself, to be in a due resolution.
EDMUND:
I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
EDMUND:
business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.
GLOUCESTER:
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
GLOUCESTER:
no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
GLOUCESTER:
reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
GLOUCESTER:
scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
GLOUCESTER:
friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
GLOUCESTER:
cities, mutinies, in countries, discord, in
GLOUCESTER:
palaces, treason, and the bond cracked 'twixt son
GLOUCESTER:
and father. This villain of mine comes under the
GLOUCESTER:
prediction, there's son against father: the king
GLOUCESTER:
falls from bias of nature, there's father against
GLOUCESTER:
child. We have seen the best of our time
GLOUCESTER:
machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
GLOUCESTER:
ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
GLOUCESTER:
graves. Find out this villain, Edmund, it shall
GLOUCESTER:
lose thee nothing, do it carefully. And the
GLOUCESTER:
noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
GLOUCESTER:
offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
EDMUND:
This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
EDMUND:
when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
EDMUND:
of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
EDMUND:
disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
EDMUND:
if we were villains by necessity, fools by
EDMUND:
heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and
EDMUND:
treachers, by spherical predominance, drunkards,
EDMUND:
liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
EDMUND:
planetary influence, and all that we are evil in,
EDMUND:
by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
EDMUND:
of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
EDMUND:
disposition to the charge of a star! My
EDMUND:
father compounded with my mother under the
EDMUND:
dragon's tail, and my nativity was under Ursa
EDMUND:
major, so that it follows, I am rough and
EDMUND:
lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
EDMUND:
had the maidenliest star in the firmament
EDMUND:
twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--
EDMUND:
Enter EDGAR
EDMUND:
And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
EDMUND:
comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a
EDMUND:
sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do
EDMUND:
portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.
EDGAR:
How now, brother Edmund! what serious
EDGAR:
contemplation are you in?
EDMUND:
I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
EDMUND:
this other day, what should follow these eclipses.
EDGAR:
Do you busy yourself about that?
EDMUND:
I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
EDMUND:
unhappily, as of unnaturalness between the child
EDMUND:
and the parent, death, dearth, dissolutions of
EDMUND:
ancient amities, divisions in state, menaces and
EDMUND:
maledictions against king and nobles, needless
EDMUND:
diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
EDMUND:
of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
EDGAR:
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
EDMUND:
Come, come, when saw you my father last?
EDGAR:
Why, the night gone by.
EDMUND:
Spake you with him?
EDGAR:
Ay, two hours together.
EDMUND:
Parted you in good terms? Found you no
EDMUND:
displeasure in him by word or countenance?
EDGAR:
None at all.
EDMUND:
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
EDMUND:
him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
EDMUND:
till some little time hath qualified the heat of
EDMUND:
his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth
EDMUND:
in him, that with the mischief of your person it
EDMUND:
would scarcely allay.
EDGAR:
Some villain hath done me wrong.
EDMUND:
That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent
EDMUND:
forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
EDMUND:
slower, and, as I say, retire with me to my
EDMUND:
lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
EDMUND:
hear my lord speak: pray ye, go, there's my key
EDMUND:
if you do stir abroad, go armed.
EDGAR:
Armed, brother!
EDMUND:
Brother, I advise you to the best, go armed: I
EDMUND:
am no honest man if there be any good meaning
EDMUND:
towards you: I have told you what I have seen
EDMUND:
and heard, but faintly, nothing like the image
EDMUND:
and horror of it: pray you, away.
EDGAR:
Shall I hear from you anon?
EDMUND:
I do serve you in this business.
EDMUND:
Exit EDGAR
EDMUND:
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
EDMUND:
Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
EDMUND:
That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty
EDMUND:
My practises ride easy! I see the business.
EDMUND:
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit
EDMUND:
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.
EDMUND:
Exit
EDMUND:
SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace.
EDMUND:
Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward
GONERIL:
Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
OSWALD:
Yes, madam.
GONERIL:
By day and night he wrongs me, every hour
GONERIL:
He flashes into one gross crime or other,
GONERIL:
That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it
GONERIL:
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
GONERIL:
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
GONERIL:
I will not speak with him, say I am sick
GONERIL:
If you come slack of former services,
GONERIL:
You shall do well, the fault of it I'll answer.
OSWALD:
He's coming, madam, I hear him.
OSWALD:
Horns within
GONERIL:
Put on what weary negligence you please,
GONERIL:
You and your fellows, I'll have it come to question
GONERIL:
If he dislike it, let him to our sister,
GONERIL:
Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
GONERIL:
Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
GONERIL:
That still would manage those authorities
GONERIL:
That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
GONERIL:
Old fools are babes again, and must be used
GONERIL:
With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
GONERIL:
Remember what I tell you.
OSWALD:
Well, madam.
GONERIL:
And let his knights have colder looks among you,
GONERIL:
What grows of it, no matter, advise your fellows so
GONERIL:
I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
GONERIL:
That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
GONERIL:
To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
GONERIL:
Exeunt
GONERIL:
SCENE IV. A hall in the same.
GONERIL:
Enter KENT, disguised
KENT:
If but as well I other accents borrow,
KENT:
That can my speech defuse, my good intent
KENT:
May carry through itself to that full issue
KENT:
For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
KENT:
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
KENT:
So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,
KENT:
Shall find thee full of labours.
KENT:
Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and Attendants
KING LEAR:
Let me not stay a jot for dinner, go get it ready.
KING LEAR:
Exit an Attendant
KING LEAR:
How now! what art thou?
KENT:
A man, sir.
KING LEAR:
What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?
KENT:
I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve
KENT:
him truly that will put me in trust: to love him
KENT:
that is honest, to converse with him that is wise,
KENT:
and says little, to fear judgment, to fight when I
KENT:
cannot choose, and to eat no fish.
KING LEAR:
What art thou?
KENT:
A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
KING LEAR:
If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a
KING LEAR:
king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
KENT:
Service.
KING LEAR:
Who wouldst thou serve?
KENT:
You.
KING LEAR:
Dost thou know me, fellow?
KENT:
No, sir, but you have that in your countenance
KENT:
which I would fain call master.
KING LEAR:
What's that?
KENT:
Authority.
KING LEAR:
What services canst thou do?
KENT:
I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious
KENT:
tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message
KENT:
bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am
KENT:
qualified in, and the best of me is diligence.
KING LEAR:
How old art thou?
KENT:
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor
KENT:
so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years
KENT:
on my back forty eight.
KING LEAR:
Follow me, thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no
KING LEAR:
worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.
KING LEAR:
Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?
KING LEAR:
Go you, and call my fool hither.
KING LEAR:
Exit an Attendant
KING LEAR:
Enter OSWALD
KING LEAR:
You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?
OSWALD:
So please you,--
OSWALD:
Exit
KING LEAR:
What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
KING LEAR:
Exit a Knight
KING LEAR:
Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.
KING LEAR:
Re-enter Knight
KING LEAR:
How now! where's that mongrel?
Knight:
He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
KING LEAR:
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.
Knight:
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
Knight:
not.
KING LEAR:
He would not!
Knight:
My lord, I know not what the matter is, but, to my
Knight:
judgment, your highness is not entertained with that
Knight:
ceremonious affection as you were wont, there's a
Knight:
great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
Knight:
general dependants as in the duke himself also and
Knight:
your daughter.
KING LEAR:
Ha! sayest thou so?
Knight:
I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken,
Knight:
for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
Knight:
highness wronged.
KING LEAR:
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I
KING LEAR:
have perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I
KING LEAR:
have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
KING LEAR:
than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness
KING LEAR:
I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I
KING LEAR:
have not seen him this two days.
Knight:
Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the
Knight:
fool hath much pined away.
KING LEAR:
No more of that, I have noted it well. Go you, and
KING LEAR:
tell my daughter I would speak with her.
KING LEAR:
Exit an Attendant
KING LEAR:
Go you, call hither my fool.
KING LEAR:
Exit an Attendant
KING LEAR:
Re-enter OSWALD
KING LEAR:
O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,
KING LEAR:
sir?
OSWALD:
My lady's father.
KING LEAR:
'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your
KING LEAR:
whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!
OSWALD:
I am none of these, my lord, I beseech your pardon.
KING LEAR:
Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
KING LEAR:
Striking him
OSWALD:
I'll not be struck, my lord.
KENT:
Nor tripped neither, you base football player.
KENT:
Tripping up his heels
KING LEAR:
I thank thee, fellow, thou servest me, and I'll
KING LEAR:
love thee.
KENT:
Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences
KENT:
away, away! if you will measure your lubber's
KENT:
length again, tarry: but away! go to, have you
KENT:
wisdom? so.
KENT:
Pushes OSWALD out
KING LEAR:
Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's
KING LEAR:
earnest of thy service.
KING LEAR:
Giving KENT money
KING LEAR:
Enter Fool
Fool:
Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.
Fool:
Offering KENT his cap
KING LEAR:
How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?
Fool:
Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
KENT:
Why, fool?
Fool:
Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour
Fool:
nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,
Fool:
thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb
Fool:
why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,
Fool:
and did the third a blessing against his will, if
Fool:
thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
Fool:
How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
KING LEAR:
Why, my boy?
Fool:
If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs
Fool:
myself. There's mine, beg another of thy daughters.
KING LEAR:
Take heed, sirrah, the whip.
Fool:
Truth's a dog must to kennel, he must be whipped
Fool:
out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.
KING LEAR:
A pestilent gall to me!
Fool:
Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.
KING LEAR:
Do.
Fool:
Mark it, nuncle
Fool:
Have more than thou showest,
Fool:
Speak less than thou knowest,
Fool:
Lend less than thou owest,
Fool:
Ride more than thou goest,
Fool:
Learn more than thou trowest,
Fool:
Set less than thou throwest,
Fool:
Leave thy drink and thy whore,
Fool:
And keep in-a-door,
Fool:
And thou shalt have more
Fool:
Than two tens to a score.
KENT:
This is nothing, fool.
Fool:
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer, you
Fool:
gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of
Fool:
nothing, nuncle?
KING LEAR:
Why, no, boy, nothing can be made out of nothing.
Fool:
[To KENT]  Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of
Fool:
his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.
KING LEAR:
A bitter fool!
Fool:
Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a
Fool:
bitter fool and a sweet fool?
KING LEAR:
No, lad, teach me.
Fool:
That lord that counsell'd thee
Fool:
To give away thy land,
Fool:
Come place him here by me,
Fool:
Do thou for him stand
Fool:
The sweet and bitter fool
Fool:
Will presently appear,
Fool:
The one in motley here,
Fool:
The other found out there.
KING LEAR:
Dost thou call me fool, boy?
Fool:
All thy other titles thou hast given away, that
Fool:
thou wast born with.
KENT:
This is not altogether fool, my lord.
Fool:
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me, if
Fool:
I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't
Fool:
and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool
Fool:
to myself, they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,
Fool:
nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.
KING LEAR:
What two crowns shall they be?
Fool:
Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat
Fool:
up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
Fool:
clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
Fool:
both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
Fool:
the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
Fool:
when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak
Fool:
like myself in this, let him be whipped that first
Fool:
finds it so.
Fool:
Singing
Fool:
Fools had ne'er less wit in a year,
Fool:
For wise men are grown foppish,
Fool:
They know not how their wits to wear,
Fool:
Their manners are so apish.
KING LEAR:
When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
Fool:
I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy
Fool:
daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them
Fool:
the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,
Fool:
Singing
Fool:
Then they for sudden joy did weep,
Fool:
And I for sorrow sung,
Fool:
That such a king should play bo-peep,
Fool:
And go the fools among.
Fool:
Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
Fool:
thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.
KING LEAR:
An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.
Fool:
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are
Fool:
they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt
Fool:
have me whipped for lying, and sometimes I am
Fool:
whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
Fool:
kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
Fool:
thee, nuncle, thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,
Fool:
and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'
Fool:
the parings.
Fool:
Enter GONERIL
KING LEAR:
How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?
KING LEAR:
Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.
Fool:
Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
Fool:
care for her frowning, now thou art an O without a
Fool:
figure: I am better than thou art now, I am a fool,
Fool:
thou art nothing.
Fool:
To GONERIL
Fool:
Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue, so your face
Fool:
bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,
Fool:
He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
Fool:
Weary of all, shall want some.
Fool:
Pointing to KING LEAR
Fool:
That's a shealed peascod.
GONERIL:
Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
GONERIL:
But other of your insolent retinue
GONERIL:
Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth
GONERIL:
In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,
GONERIL:
I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
GONERIL:
To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,
GONERIL:
By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
GONERIL:
That you protect this course, and put it on
GONERIL:
By your allowance, which if you should, the fault
GONERIL:
Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
GONERIL:
Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
GONERIL:
Might in their working do you that offence,
GONERIL:
Which else were shame, that then necessity
GONERIL:
Will call discreet proceeding.
Fool:
For, you trow, nuncle,
Fool:
The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
Fool:
That it's had it head bit off by it young.
Fool:
So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.
KING LEAR:
Are you our daughter?
GONERIL:
Come, sir,
GONERIL:
I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
GONERIL:
Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away
GONERIL:
These dispositions, that of late transform you
GONERIL:
From what you rightly are.
Fool:
May not an ass know when the cart
Fool:
draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.
KING LEAR:
Doth any here know me? This is not Lear
KING LEAR:
Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
KING LEAR:
Either his notion weakens, his discernings
KING LEAR:
Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
KING LEAR:
Who is it that can tell me who I am?
Fool:
Lear's shadow.
KING LEAR:
I would learn that, for, by the
KING LEAR:
marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
KING LEAR:
I should be false persuaded I had daughters.
Fool:
Which they will make an obedient father.
KING LEAR:
Your name, fair gentlewoman?
GONERIL:
This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour
GONERIL:
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
GONERIL:
To understand my purposes aright
GONERIL:
As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
GONERIL:
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires,
GONERIL:
Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
GONERIL:
That this our court, infected with their manners,
GONERIL:
Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
GONERIL:
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
GONERIL:
Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
GONERIL:
For instant remedy: be then desired
GONERIL:
By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
GONERIL:
A little to disquantity your train,
GONERIL:
And the remainder, that shall still depend,
GONERIL:
To be such men as may besort your age,
GONERIL:
And know themselves and you.
KING LEAR:
Darkness and devils!
KING LEAR:
Saddle my horses, call my train together
KING LEAR:
Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
KING LEAR:
Yet have I left a daughter.
GONERIL:
You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble
GONERIL:
Make servants of their betters.
GONERIL:
Enter ALBANY
KING LEAR:
Woe, that too late repents,--
KING LEAR:
To ALBANY
KING LEAR:
O, sir, are you come?
KING LEAR:
Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
KING LEAR:
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
KING LEAR:
More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
KING LEAR:
Than the sea-monster!
ALBANY:
Pray, sir, be patient.
KING LEAR:
[To GONERIL]  Detested kite! thou liest.
KING LEAR:
My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
KING LEAR:
That all particulars of duty know,
KING LEAR:
And in the most exact regard support
KING LEAR:
The worships of their name. O most small fault,
KING LEAR:
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
KING LEAR:
That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
KING LEAR:
From the fix'd place, drew from heart all love,
KING LEAR:
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
KING LEAR:
Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,
KING LEAR:
Striking his head
KING LEAR:
And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
ALBANY:
My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
ALBANY:
Of what hath moved you.
KING LEAR:
It may be so, my lord.
KING LEAR:
Hear, nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!
KING LEAR:
Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
KING LEAR:
To make this creature fruitful!
KING LEAR:
Into her womb convey sterility!
KING LEAR:
Dry up in her the organs of increase,
KING LEAR:
And from her derogate body never spring
KING LEAR:
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
KING LEAR:
Create her child of spleen, that it may live,
KING LEAR:
And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
KING LEAR:
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
KING LEAR:
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,
KING LEAR:
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
KING LEAR:
To laughter and contempt, that she may feel
KING LEAR:
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
KING LEAR:
To have a thankless child! Away, away!
KING LEAR:
Exit
ALBANY:
Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
GONERIL:
Never afflict yourself to know the cause,
GONERIL:
But let his disposition have that scope
GONERIL:
That dotage gives it.
GONERIL:
Re-enter KING LEAR
KING LEAR:
What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
KING LEAR:
Within a fortnight!
ALBANY:
What's the matter, sir?
KING LEAR:
I'll tell thee
KING LEAR:
To GONERIL
KING LEAR:
Life and death! I am ashamed
KING LEAR:
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,
KING LEAR:
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
KING LEAR:
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
KING LEAR:
The untented woundings of a father's curse
KING LEAR:
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
KING LEAR:
Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
KING LEAR:
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
KING LEAR:
To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
KING LEAR:
Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
KING LEAR:
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable
KING LEAR:
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
KING LEAR:
She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
KING LEAR:
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
KING LEAR:
I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
KING LEAR:
I warrant thee.
KING LEAR:
Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants
GONERIL:
Do you mark that, my lord?
ALBANY:
I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
ALBANY:
To the great love I bear you,--
GONERIL:
Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!
GONERIL:
To the Fool
GONERIL:
You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.
Fool:
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool
Fool:
with thee.
Fool:
A fox, when one has caught her,
Fool:
And such a daughter,
Fool:
Should sure to the slaughter,
Fool:
If my cap would buy a halter
Fool:
So the fool follows after.
Fool:
Exit
GONERIL:
This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
GONERIL:
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
GONERIL:
At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
GONERIL:
Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
GONERIL:
He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
GONERIL:
And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!
ALBANY:
Well, you may fear too far.
GONERIL:
Safer than trust too far
GONERIL:
Let me still take away the harms I fear,
GONERIL:
Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
GONERIL:
What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
GONERIL:
If she sustain him and his hundred knights
GONERIL:
When I have show'd the unfitness,--
GONERIL:
Re-enter OSWALD
GONERIL:
How now, Oswald!
GONERIL:
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
OSWALD:
Yes, madam.
GONERIL:
Take you some company, and away to horse
GONERIL:
Inform her full of my particular fear,
GONERIL:
And thereto add such reasons of your own
GONERIL:
As may compact it more. Get you gone,
GONERIL:
And hasten your return.
GONERIL:
Exit OSWALD
GONERIL:
No, no, my lord,
GONERIL:
This milky gentleness and course of yours
GONERIL:
Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,
GONERIL:
You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
GONERIL:
Than praised for harmful mildness.
ALBANY:
How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell
ALBANY:
Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
GONERIL:
Nay, then--
ALBANY:
Well, well, the event.
ALBANY:
Exeunt
ALBANY:
SCENE V. Court before the same.
ALBANY:
Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool
KING LEAR:
Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
KING LEAR:
Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
KING LEAR:
know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
KING LEAR:
If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.
KENT:
I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered
KENT:
your letter.
KENT:
Exit
Fool:
If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
Fool:
danger of kibes?
KING LEAR:
Ay, boy.
Fool:
Then, I prithee, be merry, thy wit shall ne'er go
Fool:
slip-shod.
KING LEAR:
Ha, ha, ha!
Fool:
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly,
Fool:
for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
Fool:
apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.
KING LEAR:
Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?
Fool:
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
Fool:
crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
Fool:
the middle on's face?
KING LEAR:
No.
Fool:
Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that
Fool:
what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.
KING LEAR:
I did her wrong--
Fool:
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
KING LEAR:
No.
Fool:
Nor I neither, but I can tell why a snail has a house.
KING LEAR:
Why?
Fool:
Why, to put his head in, not to give it away to his
Fool:
daughters, and leave his horns without a case.
KING LEAR:
I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
KING LEAR:
horses ready?
Fool:
Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
Fool:
seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.
KING LEAR:
Because they are not eight?
Fool:
Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.
KING LEAR:
To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
Fool:
If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
Fool:
for being old before thy time.
KING LEAR:
How's that?
Fool:
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
Fool:
been wise.
KING LEAR:
O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
KING LEAR:
Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
KING LEAR:
Enter Gentleman
KING LEAR:
How now! are the horses ready?
Gentleman:
Ready, my lord.
KING LEAR:
Come, boy.
Fool:
She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
Fool:
Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.
Fool:
Exeunt
Fool:
ACT II
Fool:
SCENE I. GLOUCESTER's castle.
Fool:
Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him
EDMUND:
Save thee, Curan.
CURAN:
And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
CURAN:
given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
CURAN:
his duchess will be here with him this night.
EDMUND:
How comes that?
CURAN:
Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad,
CURAN:
I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
CURAN:
ear-kissing arguments?
EDMUND:
Not I	pray you, what are they?
CURAN:
Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
CURAN:
Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
EDMUND:
Not a word.
CURAN:
You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
CURAN:
Exit
EDMUND:
The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
EDMUND:
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
EDMUND:
My father hath set guard to take my brother,
EDMUND:
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
EDMUND:
Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
EDMUND:
Brother, a word, descend: brother, I say!
EDMUND:
Enter EDGAR
EDMUND:
My father watches: O sir, fly this place,
EDMUND:
Intelligence is given where you are hid,
EDMUND:
You have now the good advantage of the night
EDMUND:
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
EDMUND:
He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
EDMUND:
And Regan with him: have you nothing said
EDMUND:
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
EDMUND:
Advise yourself.
EDGAR:
I am sure on't, not a word.
EDMUND:
I hear my father coming: pardon me
EDMUND:
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
EDMUND:
Draw, seem to defend yourself, now quit you well.
EDMUND:
Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
EDMUND:
Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.
EDMUND:
Exit EDGAR
EDMUND:
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.
EDMUND:
Wounds his arm
EDMUND:
Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
EDMUND:
Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
EDMUND:
Stop, stop! No help?
EDMUND:
Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches
GLOUCESTER:
Now, Edmund, where's the villain?
EDMUND:
Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
EDMUND:
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
EDMUND:
To stand auspicious mistress,--
GLOUCESTER:
But where is he?
EDMUND:
Look, sir, I bleed.
GLOUCESTER:
Where is the villain, Edmund?
EDMUND:
Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--
GLOUCESTER:
Pursue him, ho! Go after.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt some Servants
GLOUCESTER:
By no means what?
EDMUND:
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship,
EDMUND:
But that I told him, the revenging gods
EDMUND:
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend,
EDMUND:
Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
EDMUND:
The child was bound to the father, sir, in fine,
EDMUND:
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
EDMUND:
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
EDMUND:
With his prepared sword, he charges home
EDMUND:
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm
EDMUND:
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
EDMUND:
Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
EDMUND:
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
EDMUND:
Full suddenly he fled.
GLOUCESTER:
Let him fly far
GLOUCESTER:
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught,
GLOUCESTER:
And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
GLOUCESTER:
My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night
GLOUCESTER:
By his authority I will proclaim it,
GLOUCESTER:
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
GLOUCESTER:
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake,
GLOUCESTER:
He that conceals him, death.
EDMUND:
When I dissuaded him from his intent,
EDMUND:
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
EDMUND:
I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
EDMUND:
'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
EDMUND:
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
EDMUND:
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
EDMUND:
Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
EDMUND:
As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
EDMUND:
My very character,--I'ld turn it all
EDMUND:
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise
EDMUND:
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
EDMUND:
If they not thought the profits of my death
EDMUND:
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
EDMUND:
To make thee seek it.'
GLOUCESTER:
Strong and fasten'd villain
GLOUCESTER:
Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
GLOUCESTER:
Tucket within
GLOUCESTER:
Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
GLOUCESTER:
All ports I'll bar, the villain shall not 'scape,
GLOUCESTER:
The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
GLOUCESTER:
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
GLOUCESTER:
May have the due note of him, and of my land,
GLOUCESTER:
Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
GLOUCESTER:
To make thee capable.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants
CORNWALL:
How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
CORNWALL:
Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.
REGAN:
If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
REGAN:
Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?
GLOUCESTER:
O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
REGAN:
What, did my father's godson seek your life?
REGAN:
He whom my father named? your Edgar?
GLOUCESTER:
O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
REGAN:
Was he not companion with the riotous knights
REGAN:
That tend upon my father?
GLOUCESTER:
I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.
EDMUND:
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
REGAN:
No marvel, then, though he were ill affected
REGAN:
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
REGAN:
To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
REGAN:
I have this present evening from my sister
REGAN:
Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions,
REGAN:
That if they come to sojourn at my house,
REGAN:
I'll not be there.
CORNWALL:
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
CORNWALL:
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
CORNWALL:
A child-like office.
EDMUND:
'Twas my duty, sir.
GLOUCESTER:
He did bewray his practise, and received
GLOUCESTER:
This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.
CORNWALL:
Is he pursued?
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, my good lord.
CORNWALL:
If he be taken, he shall never more
CORNWALL:
Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
CORNWALL:
How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
CORNWALL:
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
CORNWALL:
So much commend itself, you shall be ours
CORNWALL:
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need,
CORNWALL:
You we first seize on.
EDMUND:
I shall serve you, sir,
EDMUND:
Truly, however else.
GLOUCESTER:
For him I thank your grace.
CORNWALL:
You know not why we came to visit you,--
REGAN:
Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night
REGAN:
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
REGAN:
Wherein we must have use of your advice
REGAN:
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
REGAN:
Of differences, which I least thought it fit
REGAN:
To answer from our home, the several messengers
REGAN:
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
REGAN:
Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
REGAN:
Your needful counsel to our business,
REGAN:
Which craves the instant use.
GLOUCESTER:
I serve you, madam
GLOUCESTER:
Your graces are right welcome.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally
OSWALD:
Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?
KENT:
Ay.
OSWALD:
Where may we set our horses?
KENT:
I' the mire.
OSWALD:
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
KENT:
I love thee not.
OSWALD:
Why, then, I care not for thee.
KENT:
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee
KENT:
care for me.
OSWALD:
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
KENT:
Fellow, I know thee.
OSWALD:
What dost thou know me for?
KENT:
A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats, a
KENT:
base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
KENT:
hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave, a
KENT:
lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
KENT:
glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue,
KENT:
one-trunk-inheriting slave, one that wouldst be a
KENT:
bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
KENT:
the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
KENT:
and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
KENT:
will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
KENT:
the least syllable of thy addition.
OSWALD:
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail
OSWALD:
on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
KENT:
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou
KENT:
knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
KENT:
thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
KENT:
rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
KENT:
shines, I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you
KENT:
draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.
KENT:
Drawing his sword
OSWALD:
Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
KENT:
Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the
KENT:
king, and take vanity the puppet's part against the
KENT:
royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so
KENT:
carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal, come your ways.
OSWALD:
Help, ho! murder! help!
KENT:
Strike, you slave, stand, rogue, stand, you neat
KENT:
slave, strike.
KENT:
Beating him
OSWALD:
Help, ho! murder! murder!
OSWALD:
Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants
EDMUND:
How now! What's the matter?
KENT:
With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll
KENT:
flesh ye, come on, young master.
GLOUCESTER:
Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?
CORNWALL:
Keep peace, upon your lives
CORNWALL:
He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?
REGAN:
The messengers from our sister and the king.
CORNWALL:
What is your difference? speak.
OSWALD:
I am scarce in breath, my lord.
KENT:
No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You
KENT:
cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
KENT:
tailor made thee.
CORNWALL:
Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
KENT:
Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
KENT:
not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
KENT:
hours at the trade.
CORNWALL:
Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
OSWALD:
This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared
OSWALD:
at suit of his gray beard,--
KENT:
Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
KENT:
lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
KENT:
unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
KENT:
a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?
CORNWALL:
Peace, sirrah!
CORNWALL:
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
KENT:
Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.
CORNWALL:
Why art thou angry?
KENT:
That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
KENT:
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
KENT:
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
KENT:
Which are too intrinse t' unloose, smooth every passion
KENT:
That in the natures of their lords rebel,
KENT:
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods,
KENT:
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
KENT:
With every gale and vary of their masters,
KENT:
Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
KENT:
A plague upon your epileptic visage!
KENT:
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
KENT:
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
KENT:
I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
CORNWALL:
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
GLOUCESTER:
How fell you out? say that.
KENT:
No contraries hold more antipathy
KENT:
Than I and such a knave.
CORNWALL:
Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?
KENT:
His countenance likes me not.
CORNWALL:
No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
KENT:
Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain
KENT:
I have seen better faces in my time
KENT:
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
KENT:
Before me at this instant.
CORNWALL:
This is some fellow,
CORNWALL:
Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
CORNWALL:
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
CORNWALL:
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
CORNWALL:
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
CORNWALL:
An they will take it, so, if not, he's plain.
CORNWALL:
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
CORNWALL:
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
CORNWALL:
Than twenty silly ducking observants
CORNWALL:
That stretch their duties nicely.
KENT:
Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
KENT:
Under the allowance of your great aspect,
KENT:
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
KENT:
On flickering Phoebus' front,--
CORNWALL:
What mean'st by this?
KENT:
To go out of my dialect, which you
KENT:
discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
KENT:
flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
KENT:
accent was a plain knave, which for my part
KENT:
I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
KENT:
to entreat me to 't.
CORNWALL:
What was the offence you gave him?
OSWALD:
I never gave him any
OSWALD:
It pleased the king his master very late
OSWALD:
To strike at me, upon his misconstruction,
OSWALD:
When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
OSWALD:
Tripp'd me behind, being down, insulted, rail'd,
OSWALD:
And put upon him such a deal of man,
OSWALD:
That worthied him, got praises of the king
OSWALD:
For him attempting who was self-subdued,
OSWALD:
And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
OSWALD:
Drew on me here again.
KENT:
None of these rogues and cowards
KENT:
But Ajax is their fool.
CORNWALL:
Fetch forth the stocks!
CORNWALL:
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
CORNWALL:
We'll teach you--
KENT:
Sir, I am too old to learn
KENT:
Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king,
KENT:
On whose employment I was sent to you
KENT:
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
KENT:
Against the grace and person of my master,
KENT:
Stocking his messenger.
CORNWALL:
Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
CORNWALL:
There shall he sit till noon.
REGAN:
Till noon! till night, my lord, and all night too.
KENT:
Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
KENT:
You should not use me so.
REGAN:
Sir, being his knave, I will.
CORNWALL:
This is a fellow of the self-same colour
CORNWALL:
Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!
CORNWALL:
Stocks brought out
GLOUCESTER:
Let me beseech your grace not to do so
GLOUCESTER:
His fault is much, and the good king his master
GLOUCESTER:
Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
GLOUCESTER:
Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
GLOUCESTER:
For pilferings and most common trespasses
GLOUCESTER:
Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
GLOUCESTER:
That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,
GLOUCESTER:
Should have him thus restrain'd.
CORNWALL:
I'll answer that.
REGAN:
My sister may receive it much more worse,
REGAN:
To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
REGAN:
For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
REGAN:
KENT is put in the stocks
REGAN:
Come, my good lord, away.
REGAN:
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT
GLOUCESTER:
I am sorry for thee, friend, 'tis the duke's pleasure,
GLOUCESTER:
Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
GLOUCESTER:
Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.
KENT:
Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard,
KENT:
Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
KENT:
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels
KENT:
Give you good morrow!
GLOUCESTER:
The duke's to blame in this, 'twill be ill taken.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
KENT:
Good king, that must approve the common saw,
KENT:
Thou out of heaven's benediction comest
KENT:
To the warm sun!
KENT:
Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
KENT:
That by thy comfortable beams I may
KENT:
Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles
KENT:
But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
KENT:
Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
KENT:
Of my obscured course, and shall find time
KENT:
From this enormous state, seeking to give
KENT:
Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
KENT:
Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
KENT:
This shameful lodging.
KENT:
Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!
KENT:
Sleeps
KENT:
SCENE III. A wood.
KENT:
Enter EDGAR
EDGAR:
I heard myself proclaim'd,
EDGAR:
And by the happy hollow of a tree
EDGAR:
Escaped the hunt. No port is free, no place,
EDGAR:
That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
EDGAR:
Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
EDGAR:
I will preserve myself: and am bethought
EDGAR:
To take the basest and most poorest shape
EDGAR:
That ever penury, in contempt of man,
EDGAR:
Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth,
EDGAR:
Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots,
EDGAR:
And with presented nakedness out-face
EDGAR:
The winds and persecutions of the sky.
EDGAR:
The country gives me proof and precedent
EDGAR:
Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
EDGAR:
Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
EDGAR:
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary,
EDGAR:
And with this horrible object, from low farms,
EDGAR:
Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
EDGAR:
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
EDGAR:
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
EDGAR:
That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.
EDGAR:
Exit
EDGAR:
SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.
EDGAR:
Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman
KING LEAR:
'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
KING LEAR:
And not send back my messenger.
Gentleman:
As I learn'd,
Gentleman:
The night before there was no purpose in them
Gentleman:
Of this remove.
KENT:
Hail to thee, noble master!
KING LEAR:
Ha!
KING LEAR:
Makest thou this shame thy pastime?
KENT:
No, my lord.
Fool:
Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied
Fool:
by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by
Fool:
the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's
Fool:
over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden
Fool:
nether-stocks.
KING LEAR:
What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
KING LEAR:
To set thee here?
KENT:
It is both he and she,
KENT:
Your son and daughter.
KING LEAR:
No.
KENT:
Yes.
KING LEAR:
No, I say.
KENT:
I say, yea.
KING LEAR:
No, no, they would not.
KENT:
Yes, they have.
KING LEAR:
By Jupiter, I swear, no.
KENT:
By Juno, I swear, ay.
KING LEAR:
They durst not do 't,
KING LEAR:
They could not, would not do 't, 'tis worse than murder,
KING LEAR:
To do upon respect such violent outrage
KING LEAR:
Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
KING LEAR:
Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,
KING LEAR:
Coming from us.
KENT:
My lord, when at their home
KENT:
I did commend your highness' letters to them,
KENT:
Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
KENT:
My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
KENT:
Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
KENT:
From Goneril his mistress salutations,
KENT:
Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
KENT:
Which presently they read: on whose contents,
KENT:
They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,
KENT:
Commanded me to follow, and attend
KENT:
The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks
KENT:
And meeting here the other messenger,
KENT:
Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
KENT:
Being the very fellow that of late
KENT:
Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
KENT:
Having more man than wit about me, drew
KENT:
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
KENT:
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
KENT:
The shame which here it suffers.
Fool:
Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.
Fool:
Fathers that wear rags
Fool:
Do make their children blind,
Fool:
But fathers that bear bags
Fool:
Shall see their children kind.
Fool:
Fortune, that arrant whore,
Fool:
Ne'er turns the key to the poor.
Fool:
But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
Fool:
for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
KING LEAR:
O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
KING LEAR:
Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
KING LEAR:
Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?
KENT:
With the earl, sir, here within.
KING LEAR:
Follow me not,
KING LEAR:
Stay here.
KING LEAR:
Exit
Gentleman:
Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
KENT:
None.
KENT:
How chance the king comes with so small a train?
Fool:
And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
Fool:
question, thou hadst well deserved it.
KENT:
Why, fool?
Fool:
We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee
Fool:
there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
Fool:
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men, and
Fool:
there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
Fool:
that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
Fool:
runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
Fool:
following it: but the great one that goes up the
Fool:
hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
Fool:
gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
Fool:
would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
Fool:
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
Fool:
And follows but for form,
Fool:
Will pack when it begins to rain,
Fool:
And leave thee in the storm,
Fool:
But I will tarry, the fool will stay,
Fool:
And let the wise man fly
Fool:
The knave turns fool that runs away,
Fool:
The fool no knave, perdy.
KENT:
Where learned you this, fool?
Fool:
Not i' the stocks, fool.
Fool:
Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER
KING LEAR:
Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
KING LEAR:
They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches,
KING LEAR:
The images of revolt and flying off.
KING LEAR:
Fetch me a better answer.
GLOUCESTER:
My dear lord,
GLOUCESTER:
You know the fiery quality of the duke,
GLOUCESTER:
How unremoveable and fix'd he is
GLOUCESTER:
In his own course.
KING LEAR:
Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
KING LEAR:
Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
KING LEAR:
I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
GLOUCESTER:
Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
KING LEAR:
Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, my good lord.
KING LEAR:
The king would speak with Cornwall, the dear father
KING LEAR:
Would with his daughter speak, commands her service
KING LEAR:
Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
KING LEAR:
Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
KING LEAR:
No, but not yet: may be he is not well
KING LEAR:
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
KING LEAR:
Whereto our health is bound, we are not ourselves
KING LEAR:
When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
KING LEAR:
To suffer with the body: I'll forbear,
KING LEAR:
And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
KING LEAR:
To take the indisposed and sickly fit
KING LEAR:
For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore
KING LEAR:
Looking on KENT
KING LEAR:
Should he sit here? This act persuades me
KING LEAR:
That this remotion of the duke and her
KING LEAR:
Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
KING LEAR:
Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
KING LEAR:
Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
KING LEAR:
Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
KING LEAR:
Till it cry sleep to death.
GLOUCESTER:
I would have all well betwixt you.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
KING LEAR:
O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!
Fool:
Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels
Fool:
when she put 'em i' the paste alive, she knapped 'em
Fool:
o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,
Fool:
wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure
Fool:
kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.
Fool:
Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants
KING LEAR:
Good morrow to you both.
CORNWALL:
Hail to your grace!
CORNWALL:
KENT is set at liberty
REGAN:
I am glad to see your highness.
KING LEAR:
Regan, I think you are, I know what reason
KING LEAR:
I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
KING LEAR:
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
KING LEAR:
Sepulchring an adultress.
KING LEAR:
To KENT
KING LEAR:
O, are you free?
KING LEAR:
Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
KING LEAR:
Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
KING LEAR:
Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here
KING LEAR:
Points to his heart
KING LEAR:
I can scarce speak to thee, thou'lt not believe
KING LEAR:
With how depraved a quality--O Regan!
REGAN:
I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.
REGAN:
You less know how to value her desert
REGAN:
Than she to scant her duty.
KING LEAR:
Say, how is that?
REGAN:
I cannot think my sister in the least
REGAN:
Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
REGAN:
She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
REGAN:
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
REGAN:
As clears her from all blame.
KING LEAR:
My curses on her!
REGAN:
O, sir, you are old.
REGAN:
Nature in you stands on the very verge
REGAN:
Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
REGAN:
By some discretion, that discerns your state
REGAN:
Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
REGAN:
That to our sister you do make return,
REGAN:
Say you have wrong'd her, sir.
KING LEAR:
Ask her forgiveness?
KING LEAR:
Do you but mark how this becomes the house
KING LEAR:
'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old,
KING LEAR:
Kneeling
KING LEAR:
Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
KING LEAR:
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'
REGAN:
Good sir, no more, these are unsightly tricks
REGAN:
Return you to my sister.
KING LEAR:
[Rising]  Never, Regan
KING LEAR:
She hath abated me of half my train,
KING LEAR:
Look'd black upon me, struck me with her tongue,
KING LEAR:
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart
KING LEAR:
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
KING LEAR:
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
KING LEAR:
You taking airs, with lameness!
CORNWALL:
Fie, sir, fie!
KING LEAR:
You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
KING LEAR:
Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
KING LEAR:
You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
KING LEAR:
To fall and blast her pride!
REGAN:
O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
REGAN:
When the rash mood is on.
KING LEAR:
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse
KING LEAR:
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
KING LEAR:
Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce, but thine
KING LEAR:
Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
KING LEAR:
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
KING LEAR:
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
KING LEAR:
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
KING LEAR:
Against my coming in: thou better know'st
KING LEAR:
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
KING LEAR:
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude,
KING LEAR:
Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
KING LEAR:
Wherein I thee endow'd.
REGAN:
Good sir, to the purpose.
KING LEAR:
Who put my man i' the stocks?
KING LEAR:
Tucket within
CORNWALL:
What trumpet's that?
REGAN:
I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
REGAN:
That she would soon be here.
REGAN:
Enter OSWALD
REGAN:
Is your lady come?
KING LEAR:
This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
KING LEAR:
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
KING LEAR:
Out, varlet, from my sight!
CORNWALL:
What means your grace?
KING LEAR:
Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
KING LEAR:
Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,
KING LEAR:
Enter GONERIL
KING LEAR:
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
KING LEAR:
Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
KING LEAR:
Make it your cause, send down, and take my part!
KING LEAR:
To GONERIL
KING LEAR:
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
KING LEAR:
O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
GONERIL:
Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
GONERIL:
All's not offence that indiscretion finds
GONERIL:
And dotage terms so.
KING LEAR:
O sides, you are too tough,
KING LEAR:
Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?
CORNWALL:
I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
CORNWALL:
Deserved much less advancement.
KING LEAR:
You! did you?
REGAN:
I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
REGAN:
If, till the expiration of your month,
REGAN:
You will return and sojourn with my sister,
REGAN:
Dismissing half your train, come then to me
REGAN:
I am now from home, and out of that provision
REGAN:
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
KING LEAR:
Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
KING LEAR:
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
KING LEAR:
To wage against the enmity o' the air,
KING LEAR:
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
KING LEAR:
Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
KING LEAR:
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
KING LEAR:
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
KING LEAR:
To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
KING LEAR:
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
KING LEAR:
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
KING LEAR:
To this detested groom.
KING LEAR:
Pointing at OSWALD
GONERIL:
At your choice, sir.
KING LEAR:
I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad
KING LEAR:
I will not trouble thee, my child, farewell
KING LEAR:
We'll no more meet, no more see one another
KING LEAR:
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter,
KING LEAR:
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
KING LEAR:
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
KING LEAR:
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
KING LEAR:
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee,
KING LEAR:
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it
KING LEAR:
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
KING LEAR:
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove
KING LEAR:
Mend when thou canst, be better at thy leisure
KING LEAR:
I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,
KING LEAR:
I and my hundred knights.
REGAN:
Not altogether so
REGAN:
I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
REGAN:
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister,
REGAN:
For those that mingle reason with your passion
REGAN:
Must be content to think you old, and so--
REGAN:
But she knows what she does.
KING LEAR:
Is this well spoken?
REGAN:
I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
REGAN:
Is it not well? What should you need of more?
REGAN:
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
REGAN:
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
REGAN:
Should many people, under two commands,
REGAN:
Hold amity? 'Tis hard, almost impossible.
GONERIL:
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
GONERIL:
From those that she calls servants or from mine?
REGAN:
Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
REGAN:
We could control them. If you will come to me,--
REGAN:
For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
REGAN:
To bring but five and twenty: to no more
REGAN:
Will I give place or notice.
KING LEAR:
I gave you all--
REGAN:
And in good time you gave it.
KING LEAR:
Made you my guardians, my depositaries,
KING LEAR:
But kept a reservation to be follow'd
KING LEAR:
With such a number. What, must I come to you
KING LEAR:
With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?
REGAN:
And speak't again, my lord, no more with me.
KING LEAR:
Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
KING LEAR:
When others are more wicked: not being the worst
KING LEAR:
Stands in some rank of praise.
KING LEAR:
To GONERIL
KING LEAR:
I'll go with thee
KING LEAR:
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
KING LEAR:
And thou art twice her love.
GONERIL:
Hear me, my lord,
GONERIL:
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
GONERIL:
To follow in a house where twice so many
GONERIL:
Have a command to tend you?
REGAN:
What need one?
KING LEAR:
O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
KING LEAR:
Are in the poorest thing superfluous
KING LEAR:
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
KING LEAR:
Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady,
KING LEAR:
If only to go warm were gorgeous,
KING LEAR:
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
KING LEAR:
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
KING LEAR:
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
KING LEAR:
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
KING LEAR:
As full of grief as age, wretched in both!
KING LEAR:
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
KING LEAR:
Against their father, fool me not so much
KING LEAR:
To bear it tamely, touch me with noble anger,
KING LEAR:
And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
KING LEAR:
Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
KING LEAR:
I will have such revenges on you both,
KING LEAR:
That all the world shall--I will do such things,--
KING LEAR:
What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
KING LEAR:
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
KING LEAR:
No, I'll not weep
KING LEAR:
I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
KING LEAR:
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
KING LEAR:
Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
KING LEAR:
Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool
KING LEAR:
Storm and tempest
CORNWALL:
Let us withdraw, 'twill be a storm.
REGAN:
This house is little: the old man and his people
REGAN:
Cannot be well bestow'd.
GONERIL:
'Tis his own blame, hath put himself from rest,
GONERIL:
And must needs taste his folly.
REGAN:
For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
REGAN:
But not one follower.
GONERIL:
So am I purposed.
GONERIL:
Where is my lord of Gloucester?
CORNWALL:
Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.
CORNWALL:
Re-enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
The king is in high rage.
CORNWALL:
Whither is he going?
GLOUCESTER:
He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.
CORNWALL:
'Tis best to give him way, he leads himself.
GONERIL:
My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
GLOUCESTER:
Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
GLOUCESTER:
Do sorely ruffle, for many miles a bout
GLOUCESTER:
There's scarce a bush.
REGAN:
O, sir, to wilful men,
REGAN:
The injuries that they themselves procure
REGAN:
Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors
REGAN:
He is attended with a desperate train,
REGAN:
And what they may incense him to, being apt
REGAN:
To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.
CORNWALL:
Shut up your doors, my lord, 'tis a wild night
CORNWALL:
My Regan counsels well, come out o' the storm.
CORNWALL:
Exeunt
CORNWALL:
ACT III
CORNWALL:
SCENE I. A heath.
CORNWALL:
Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting
KENT:
Who's there, besides foul weather?
Gentleman:
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
KENT:
I know you. Where's the king?
Gentleman:
Contending with the fretful element
Gentleman:
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
Gentleman:
Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
Gentleman:
That things might change or cease, tears his white hair,
Gentleman:
Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
Gentleman:
Catch in their fury, and make nothing of,
Gentleman:
Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
Gentleman:
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
Gentleman:
This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
Gentleman:
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
Gentleman:
Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
Gentleman:
And bids what will take all.
KENT:
But who is with him?
Gentleman:
None but the fool, who labours to out-jest
Gentleman:
His heart-struck injuries.
KENT:
Sir, I do know you,
KENT:
And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
KENT:
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
KENT:
Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
KENT:
With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall,
KENT:
Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
KENT:
Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
KENT:
Which are to France the spies and speculations
KENT:
Intelligent of our state, what hath been seen,
KENT:
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
KENT:
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
KENT:
Against the old kind king, or something deeper,
KENT:
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings,
KENT:
But, true it is, from France there comes a power
KENT:
Into this scatter'd kingdom, who already,
KENT:
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
KENT:
In some of our best ports, and are at point
KENT:
To show their open banner. Now to you
KENT:
If on my credit you dare build so far
KENT:
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
KENT:
Some that will thank you, making just report
KENT:
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
KENT:
The king hath cause to plain.
KENT:
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,
KENT:
And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
KENT:
This office to you.
Gentleman:
I will talk further with you.
KENT:
No, do not.
KENT:
For confirmation that I am much more
KENT:
Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
KENT:
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
KENT:
As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring,
KENT:
And she will tell you who your fellow is
KENT:
That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
KENT:
I will go seek the king.
Gentleman:
Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
KENT:
Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet,
KENT:
That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain
KENT:
That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
KENT:
Holla the other.
KENT:
Exeunt severally
KENT:
SCENE II. Another part of the heath. Storm still.
KENT:
Enter KING LEAR and Fool
KING LEAR:
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
KING LEAR:
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
KING LEAR:
Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
KING LEAR:
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
KING LEAR:
Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
KING LEAR:
Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
KING LEAR:
Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
KING LEAR:
Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,
KING LEAR:
That make ingrateful man!
Fool:
O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry
Fool:
house is better than this rain-water out o' door.
Fool:
Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing
Fool:
here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.
KING LEAR:
Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
KING LEAR:
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters
KING LEAR:
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness,
KING LEAR:
I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
KING LEAR:
You owe me no subscription: then let fall
KING LEAR:
Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,
KING LEAR:
A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man
KING LEAR:
But yet I call you servile ministers,
KING LEAR:
That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
KING LEAR:
Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
KING LEAR:
So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!
Fool:
He that has a house to put's head in has a good
Fool:
head-piece.
Fool:
The cod-piece that will house
Fool:
Before the head has any,
Fool:
The head and he shall louse,
Fool:
So beggars marry many.
Fool:
The man that makes his toe
Fool:
What he his heart should make
Fool:
Shall of a corn cry woe,
Fool:
And turn his sleep to wake.
Fool:
For there was never yet fair woman but she made
Fool:
mouths in a glass.
KING LEAR:
No, I will be the pattern of all patience,
KING LEAR:
I will say nothing.
KING LEAR:
Enter KENT
KENT:
Who's there?
Fool:
Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece, that's a wise
Fool:
man and a fool.
KENT:
Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night
KENT:
Love not such nights as these, the wrathful skies
KENT:
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
KENT:
And make them keep their caves: since I was man,
KENT:
Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
KENT:
Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
KENT:
Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
KENT:
The affliction nor the fear.
KING LEAR:
Let the great gods,
KING LEAR:
That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
KING LEAR:
Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
KING LEAR:
That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
KING LEAR:
Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand,
KING LEAR:
Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue
KING LEAR:
That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
KING LEAR:
That under covert and convenient seeming
KING LEAR:
Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
KING LEAR:
Rive your concealing continents, and cry
KING LEAR:
These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
KING LEAR:
More sinn'd against than sinning.
KENT:
Alack, bare-headed!
KENT:
Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel,
KENT:
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest
KENT:
Repose you there, while I to this hard house--
KENT:
More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised,
KENT:
Which even but now, demanding after you,
KENT:
Denied me to come in--return, and force
KENT:
Their scanted courtesy.
KING LEAR:
My wits begin to turn.
KING LEAR:
Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
KING LEAR:
I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
KING LEAR:
The art of our necessities is strange,
KING LEAR:
That can make vile things precious. Come,
KING LEAR:
your hovel.
KING LEAR:
Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
KING LEAR:
That's sorry yet for thee.
Fool:
[Singing]
Fool:
He that has and a little tiny wit--
Fool:
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--
Fool:
Must make content with his fortunes fit,
Fool:
For the rain it raineth every day.
KING LEAR:
True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.
KING LEAR:
Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT
Fool:
This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
Fool:
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go
Fool:
When priests are more in word than matter,
Fool:
When brewers mar their malt with water,
Fool:
When nobles are their tailors' tutors,
Fool:
No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors,
Fool:
When every case in law is right,
Fool:
No squire in debt, nor no poor knight,
Fool:
When slanders do not live in tongues,
Fool:
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs,
Fool:
When usurers tell their gold i' the field,
Fool:
And bawds and whores do churches build,
Fool:
Then shall the realm of Albion
Fool:
Come to great confusion
Fool:
Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
Fool:
That going shall be used with feet.
Fool:
This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.
Fool:
Exit
Fool:
SCENE III. Gloucester's castle.
Fool:
Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
GLOUCESTER:
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural
GLOUCESTER:
dealing. When I desire their leave that I might
GLOUCESTER:
pity him, they took from me the use of mine own
GLOUCESTER:
house, charged me, on pain of their perpetual
GLOUCESTER:
displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for
GLOUCESTER:
him, nor any way sustain him.
EDMUND:
Most savage and unnatural!
GLOUCESTER:
Go to, say you nothing. There's a division betwixt
GLOUCESTER:
the dukes, and a worse matter than that: I have
GLOUCESTER:
received a letter this night, 'tis dangerous to be
GLOUCESTER:
spoken, I have locked the letter in my closet
GLOUCESTER:
these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
GLOUCESTER:
home, there's part of a power already footed: we
GLOUCESTER:
must incline to the king. I will seek him, and
GLOUCESTER:
privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with
GLOUCESTER:
the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived
GLOUCESTER:
if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.
GLOUCESTER:
Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,
GLOUCESTER:
the king my old master must be relieved. There is
GLOUCESTER:
some strange thing toward, Edmund, pray you, be careful.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
EDMUND:
This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
EDMUND:
Instantly know, and of that letter too
EDMUND:
This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
EDMUND:
That which my father loses, no less than all
EDMUND:
The younger rises when the old doth fall.
EDMUND:
Exit
EDMUND:
SCENE IV. The heath. Before a hovel.
EDMUND:
Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool
KENT:
Here is the place, my lord, good my lord, enter
KENT:
The tyranny of the open night's too rough
KENT:
For nature to endure.
KENT:
Storm still
KING LEAR:
Let me alone.
KENT:
Good my lord, enter here.
KING LEAR:
Wilt break my heart?
KENT:
I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.
KING LEAR:
Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
KING LEAR:
Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee,
KING LEAR:
But where the greater malady is fix'd,
KING LEAR:
The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear,
KING LEAR:
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
KING LEAR:
Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the
KING LEAR:
mind's free,
KING LEAR:
The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
KING LEAR:
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
KING LEAR:
Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
KING LEAR:
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
KING LEAR:
For lifting food to't? But I will punish home
KING LEAR:
No, I will weep no more. In such a night
KING LEAR:
To shut me out! Pour on, I will endure.
KING LEAR:
In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
KING LEAR:
Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--
KING LEAR:
O, that way madness lies, let me shun that,
KING LEAR:
No more of that.
KENT:
Good my lord, enter here.
KING LEAR:
Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease
KING LEAR:
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
KING LEAR:
On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
KING LEAR:
To the Fool
KING LEAR:
In, boy, go first. You houseless poverty,--
KING LEAR:
Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
KING LEAR:
Fool goes in
KING LEAR:
Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,
KING LEAR:
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
KING LEAR:
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
KING LEAR:
Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
KING LEAR:
From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
KING LEAR:
Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp,
KING LEAR:
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
KING LEAR:
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
KING LEAR:
And show the heavens more just.
EDGAR:
[Within]  Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
EDGAR:
The Fool runs out from the hovel
Fool:
Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit
Fool:
Help me, help me!
KENT:
Give me thy hand. Who's there?
Fool:
A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.
KENT:
What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
KENT:
Come forth.
KENT:
Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man
EDGAR:
Away! the foul fiend follows me!
EDGAR:
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
EDGAR:
Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
KING LEAR:
Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
KING LEAR:
And art thou come to this?
EDGAR:
Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
EDGAR:
fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and
EDGAR:
through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire,
EDGAR:
that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
EDGAR:
in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made film
EDGAR:
proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
EDGAR:
four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a
EDGAR:
traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do
EDGAR:
de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,
EDGAR:
star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
EDGAR:
charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I
EDGAR:
have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.
EDGAR:
Storm still
KING LEAR:
What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
KING LEAR:
Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?
Fool:
Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
KING LEAR:
Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
KING LEAR:
Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
KENT:
He hath no daughters, sir.
KING LEAR:
Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
KING LEAR:
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
KING LEAR:
Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
KING LEAR:
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
KING LEAR:
Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
KING LEAR:
Those pelican daughters.
EDGAR:
Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill
EDGAR:
Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!
Fool:
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
EDGAR:
Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents,
EDGAR:
keep thy word justly, swear not, commit not with
EDGAR:
man's sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on proud
EDGAR:
array. Tom's a-cold.
KING LEAR:
What hast thou been?
EDGAR:
A serving-man, proud in heart and mind, that curled
EDGAR:
my hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the lust of
EDGAR:
my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with
EDGAR:
her, swore as many oaths as I spake words, and
EDGAR:
broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
EDGAR:
slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it
EDGAR:
wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman
EDGAR:
out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of
EDGAR:
ear, bloody of hand, hog in sloth, fox in stealth,
EDGAR:
wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
EDGAR:
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
EDGAR:
silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
EDGAR:
out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen
EDGAR:
from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
EDGAR:
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind
EDGAR:
Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
EDGAR:
Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.
EDGAR:
Storm still
KING LEAR:
Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer
KING LEAR:
with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
KING LEAR:
Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou
KING LEAR:
owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep
KING LEAR:
no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on
KING LEAR:
's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself
KING LEAR:
unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,
KING LEAR:
forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!
KING LEAR:
come unbutton here.
KING LEAR:
Tearing off his clothes
Fool:
Prithee, nuncle, be contented, 'tis a naughty night
Fool:
to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were
Fool:
like an old lecher's heart, a small spark, all the
Fool:
rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.
Fool:
Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch
EDGAR:
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
EDGAR:
at curfew, and walks till the first cock, he gives
EDGAR:
the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
EDGAR:
hare-lip, mildews the white wheat, and hurts the
EDGAR:
poor creature of earth.
EDGAR:
S. Withold footed thrice the old,
EDGAR:
He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold,
EDGAR:
Bid her alight,
EDGAR:
And her troth plight,
EDGAR:
And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
KENT:
How fares your grace?
KING LEAR:
What's he?
KENT:
Who's there? What is't you seek?
GLOUCESTER:
What are you there? Your names?
EDGAR:
Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
EDGAR:
the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water, that in
EDGAR:
the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
EDGAR:
eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows the old rat and
EDGAR:
the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the
EDGAR:
standing pool, who is whipped from tithing to
EDGAR:
tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned, who
EDGAR:
hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his
EDGAR:
body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear,
EDGAR:
But mice and rats, and such small deer,
EDGAR:
Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
EDGAR:
Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin, peace, thou fiend!
GLOUCESTER:
What, hath your grace no better company?
EDGAR:
The prince of darkness is a gentleman
EDGAR:
Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
GLOUCESTER:
Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
GLOUCESTER:
That it doth hate what gets it.
EDGAR:
Poor Tom's a-cold.
GLOUCESTER:
Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
GLOUCESTER:
To obey in all your daughters' hard commands
GLOUCESTER:
Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
GLOUCESTER:
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
GLOUCESTER:
Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,
GLOUCESTER:
And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
KING LEAR:
First let me talk with this philosopher.
KING LEAR:
What is the cause of thunder?
KENT:
Good my lord, take his offer, go into the house.
KING LEAR:
I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
KING LEAR:
What is your study?
EDGAR:
How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.
KING LEAR:
Let me ask you one word in private.
KENT:
Importune him once more to go, my lord,
KENT:
His wits begin to unsettle.
GLOUCESTER:
Canst thou blame him?
GLOUCESTER:
Storm still
GLOUCESTER:
His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!
GLOUCESTER:
He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
GLOUCESTER:
Thou say'st the king grows mad, I'll tell thee, friend,
GLOUCESTER:
I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
GLOUCESTER:
Now outlaw'd from my blood, he sought my life,
GLOUCESTER:
But lately, very late: I loved him, friend,
GLOUCESTER:
No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,
GLOUCESTER:
The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!
GLOUCESTER:
I do beseech your grace,--
KING LEAR:
O, cry your mercy, sir.
KING LEAR:
Noble philosopher, your company.
EDGAR:
Tom's a-cold.
GLOUCESTER:
In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.
KING LEAR:
Come let's in all.
KENT:
This way, my lord.
KING LEAR:
With him,
KING LEAR:
I will keep still with my philosopher.
KENT:
Good my lord, soothe him, let him take the fellow.
GLOUCESTER:
Take him you on.
KENT:
Sirrah, come on, go along with us.
KING LEAR:
Come, good Athenian.
GLOUCESTER:
No words, no words: hush.
EDGAR:
Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
EDGAR:
His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
EDGAR:
I smell the blood of a British man.
EDGAR:
Exeunt
EDGAR:
SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.
EDGAR:
Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND
CORNWALL:
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
EDMUND:
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
EDMUND:
gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
EDMUND:
of.
CORNWALL:
I now perceive, it was not altogether your
CORNWALL:
brother's evil disposition made him seek his death,
CORNWALL:
but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
CORNWALL:
badness in himself.
EDMUND:
How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
EDMUND:
be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
EDMUND:
approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
EDMUND:
of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
EDMUND:
or not I the detector!
CORNWALL:
o with me to the duchess.
EDMUND:
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
EDMUND:
mighty business in hand.
CORNWALL:
True or false, it hath made thee earl of
CORNWALL:
Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
CORNWALL:
may be ready for our apprehension.
EDMUND:
[Aside]  If I find him comforting the king, it will
EDMUND:
stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
EDMUND:
my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
EDMUND:
between that and my blood.
CORNWALL:
I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a
CORNWALL:
dearer father in my love.
CORNWALL:
Exeunt
CORNWALL:
SCENE VI. A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle.
CORNWALL:
Enter GLOUCESTER, KING LEAR, KENT, Fool, and EDGAR
GLOUCESTER:
Here is better than the open air, take it
GLOUCESTER:
thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what
GLOUCESTER:
addition I can: I will not be long from you.
KENT:
All the power of his wits have given way to his
KENT:
impatience: the gods reward your kindness!
KENT:
Exit GLOUCESTER
EDGAR:
Frateretto calls me, and tells me
EDGAR:
Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
EDGAR:
Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.
Fool:
Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a
Fool:
gentleman or a yeoman?
KING LEAR:
A king, a king!
Fool:
No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son,
Fool:
for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman
Fool:
before him.
KING LEAR:
To have a thousand with red burning spits
KING LEAR:
Come hissing in upon 'em,--
EDGAR:
The foul fiend bites my back.
Fool:
He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
Fool:
horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.
KING LEAR:
It shall be done, I will arraign them straight.
KING LEAR:
To EDGAR
KING LEAR:
Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer,
KING LEAR:
To the Fool
KING LEAR:
Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!
EDGAR:
Look, where he stands and glares!
EDGAR:
Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
EDGAR:
Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--
Fool:
Her boat hath a leak,
Fool:
And she must not speak
Fool:
Why she dares not come over to thee.
EDGAR:
The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
EDGAR:
nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
EDGAR:
white herring. Croak not, black angel, I have no
EDGAR:
food for thee.
KENT:
How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed
KENT:
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
KING LEAR:
I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
KING LEAR:
To EDGAR
KING LEAR:
Thou robed man of justice, take thy place,
KING LEAR:
To the Fool
KING LEAR:
And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
KING LEAR:
Bench by his side
KING LEAR:
To KENT
KING LEAR:
you are o' the commission,
KING LEAR:
Sit you too.
EDGAR:
Let us deal justly.
EDGAR:
Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
EDGAR:
Thy sheep be in the corn,
EDGAR:
And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
EDGAR:
Thy sheep shall take no harm.
EDGAR:
Pur! the cat is gray.
KING LEAR:
Arraign her first, 'tis Goneril. I here take my
KING LEAR:
oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the
KING LEAR:
poor king her father.
Fool:
Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?
KING LEAR:
She cannot deny it.
Fool:
Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.
KING LEAR:
And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
KING LEAR:
What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
KING LEAR:
Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
KING LEAR:
False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?
EDGAR:
Bless thy five wits!
KENT:
O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
KENT:
That thou so oft have boasted to retain?
EDGAR:
[Aside]  My tears begin to take his part so much,
EDGAR:
They'll mar my counterfeiting.
KING LEAR:
The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and
KING LEAR:
Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.
EDGAR:
Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
EDGAR:
Be thy mouth or black or white,
EDGAR:
Tooth that poisons if it bite,
EDGAR:
Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,
EDGAR:
Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
EDGAR:
Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
EDGAR:
Tom will make them weep and wail
EDGAR:
For, with throwing thus my head,
EDGAR:
Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
EDGAR:
Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and
EDGAR:
fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
KING LEAR:
Then let them anatomize Regan, see what breeds
KING LEAR:
about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that
KING LEAR:
makes these hard hearts?
KING LEAR:
To EDGAR
KING LEAR:
You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred, only I
KING LEAR:
do not like the fashion of your garments: you will
KING LEAR:
say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.
KENT:
Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
KING LEAR:
Make no noise, make no noise, draw the curtains
KING LEAR:
so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.
Fool:
And I'll go to bed at noon.
Fool:
Re-enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?
KENT:
Here, sir, but trouble him not, his wits are gone.
GLOUCESTER:
Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms,
GLOUCESTER:
I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him
GLOUCESTER:
There is a litter ready, lay him in 't,
GLOUCESTER:
And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
GLOUCESTER:
Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master
GLOUCESTER:
If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
GLOUCESTER:
With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
GLOUCESTER:
Stand in assured loss: take up, take up,
GLOUCESTER:
And follow me, that will to some provision
GLOUCESTER:
Give thee quick conduct.
KENT:
Oppressed nature sleeps
KENT:
This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
KENT:
Which, if convenience will not allow,
KENT:
Stand in hard cure.
KENT:
To the Fool
KENT:
Come, help to bear thy master,
KENT:
Thou must not stay behind.
GLOUCESTER:
Come, come, away.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt all but EDGAR
EDGAR:
When we our betters see bearing our woes,
EDGAR:
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
EDGAR:
Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
EDGAR:
Leaving free things and happy shows behind
EDGAR:
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,
EDGAR:
When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
EDGAR:
How light and portable my pain seems now,
EDGAR:
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
EDGAR:
He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
EDGAR:
Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray,
EDGAR:
When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
EDGAR:
In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
EDGAR:
What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
EDGAR:
Lurk, lurk.
EDGAR:
Exit
EDGAR:
SCENE VII. Gloucester's castle.
EDGAR:
Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants
CORNWALL:
Post speedily to my lord your husband, show him
CORNWALL:
this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek
CORNWALL:
out the villain Gloucester.
CORNWALL:
Exeunt some of the Servants
REGAN:
Hang him instantly.
GONERIL:
Pluck out his eyes.
CORNWALL:
Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
CORNWALL:
sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
CORNWALL:
upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
CORNWALL:
beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
CORNWALL:
a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
CORNWALL:
like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
CORNWALL:
betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my
CORNWALL:
lord of Gloucester.
CORNWALL:
Enter OSWALD
CORNWALL:
How now! where's the king?
OSWALD:
My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence
OSWALD:
Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
OSWALD:
Hot questrists after him, met him at gate,
OSWALD:
Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
OSWALD:
Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast
OSWALD:
To have well-armed friends.
CORNWALL:
Get horses for your mistress.
GONERIL:
Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
CORNWALL:
Edmund, farewell.
CORNWALL:
Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD
CORNWALL:
Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
CORNWALL:
Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
CORNWALL:
Exeunt other Servants
CORNWALL:
Though well we may not pass upon his life
CORNWALL:
Without the form of justice, yet our power
CORNWALL:
Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
CORNWALL:
May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?
CORNWALL:
Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three
REGAN:
Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.
CORNWALL:
Bind fast his corky arms.
GLOUCESTER:
What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider
GLOUCESTER:
You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.
CORNWALL:
Bind him, I say.
CORNWALL:
Servants bind him
REGAN:
Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
GLOUCESTER:
Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.
CORNWALL:
To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--
CORNWALL:
REGAN plucks his beard
GLOUCESTER:
By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
GLOUCESTER:
To pluck me by the beard.
REGAN:
So white, and such a traitor!
GLOUCESTER:
Naughty lady,
GLOUCESTER:
These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
GLOUCESTER:
Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host
GLOUCESTER:
With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
GLOUCESTER:
You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
CORNWALL:
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
REGAN:
Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.
CORNWALL:
And what confederacy have you with the traitors
CORNWALL:
Late footed in the kingdom?
REGAN:
To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.
GLOUCESTER:
I have a letter guessingly set down,
GLOUCESTER:
Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
GLOUCESTER:
And not from one opposed.
CORNWALL:
Cunning.
REGAN:
And false.
CORNWALL:
Where hast thou sent the king?
GLOUCESTER:
To Dover.
REGAN:
Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--
CORNWALL:
Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
GLOUCESTER:
I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.
REGAN:
Wherefore to Dover, sir?
GLOUCESTER:
Because I would not see thy cruel nails
GLOUCESTER:
Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister
GLOUCESTER:
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
GLOUCESTER:
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
GLOUCESTER:
In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
GLOUCESTER:
And quench'd the stelled fires
GLOUCESTER:
Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
GLOUCESTER:
If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
GLOUCESTER:
Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
GLOUCESTER:
All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
GLOUCESTER:
The winged vengeance overtake such children.
CORNWALL:
See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
CORNWALL:
Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
GLOUCESTER:
He that will think to live till he be old,
GLOUCESTER:
Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!
REGAN:
One side will mock another, the other too.
CORNWALL:
If you see vengeance,--
First Servant:
Hold your hand, my lord
First Servant:
I have served you ever since I was a child,
First Servant:
But better service have I never done you
First Servant:
Than now to bid you hold.
REGAN:
How now, you dog!
First Servant:
If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
First Servant:
I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?
CORNWALL:
My villain!
CORNWALL:
They draw and fight
First Servant:
Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
REGAN:
Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
REGAN:
Takes a sword, and runs at him behind
First Servant:
O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
First Servant:
To see some mischief on him. O!
First Servant:
Dies
CORNWALL:
Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
CORNWALL:
Where is thy lustre now?
GLOUCESTER:
All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
GLOUCESTER:
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
GLOUCESTER:
To quit this horrid act.
REGAN:
Out, treacherous villain!
REGAN:
Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
REGAN:
That made the overture of thy treasons to us,
REGAN:
Who is too good to pity thee.
GLOUCESTER:
O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
GLOUCESTER:
Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
REGAN:
Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
REGAN:
His way to Dover.
REGAN:
Exit one with GLOUCESTER
REGAN:
How is't, my lord? how look you?
CORNWALL:
I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
CORNWALL:
Turn out that eyeless villain, throw this slave
CORNWALL:
Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace
CORNWALL:
Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.
CORNWALL:
Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN
Second Servant:
I'll never care what wickedness I do,
Second Servant:
If this man come to good.
Third Servant:
If she live long,
Third Servant:
And in the end meet the old course of death,
Third Servant:
Women will all turn monsters.
Second Servant:
Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
Second Servant:
To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
Second Servant:
Allows itself to any thing.
Third Servant:
Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
Third Servant:
To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!
Third Servant:
Exeunt severally
Third Servant:
ACT IV
Third Servant:
SCENE I. The heath.
Third Servant:
Enter EDGAR
EDGAR:
Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
EDGAR:
Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
EDGAR:
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
EDGAR:
Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear
EDGAR:
The lamentable change is from the best,
EDGAR:
The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
EDGAR:
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
EDGAR:
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
EDGAR:
Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
EDGAR:
Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man
EDGAR:
My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
EDGAR:
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
EDGAR:
Lie would not yield to age.
Old Man:
O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and
Old Man:
your father's tenant, these fourscore years.
GLOUCESTER:
Away, get thee away, good friend, be gone
GLOUCESTER:
Thy comforts can do me no good at all,
GLOUCESTER:
Thee they may hurt.
Old Man:
Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.
GLOUCESTER:
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes,
GLOUCESTER:
I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,
GLOUCESTER:
Our means secure us, and our mere defects
GLOUCESTER:
Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
GLOUCESTER:
The food of thy abused father's wrath!
GLOUCESTER:
Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
GLOUCESTER:
I'ld say I had eyes again!
Old Man:
How now! Who's there?
EDGAR:
[Aside]  O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
EDGAR:
the worst'?
EDGAR:
I am worse than e'er I was.
Old Man:
'Tis poor mad Tom.
EDGAR:
[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
EDGAR:
So long as we can say  'This is the worst.'
Old Man:
Fellow, where goest?
GLOUCESTER:
Is it a beggar-man?
Old Man:
Madman and beggar too.
GLOUCESTER:
He has some reason, else he could not beg.
GLOUCESTER:
I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw,
GLOUCESTER:
Which made me think a man a worm: my son
GLOUCESTER:
Came then into my mind, and yet my mind
GLOUCESTER:
Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
GLOUCESTER:
more since.
GLOUCESTER:
As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
GLOUCESTER:
They kill us for their sport.
EDGAR:
[Aside]	How should this be?
EDGAR:
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
EDGAR:
Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!
GLOUCESTER:
Is that the naked fellow?
Old Man:
Ay, my lord.
GLOUCESTER:
Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,
GLOUCESTER:
Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
GLOUCESTER:
I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love,
GLOUCESTER:
And bring some covering for this naked soul,
GLOUCESTER:
Who I'll entreat to lead me.
Old Man:
Alack, sir, he is mad.
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
GLOUCESTER:
Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure,
GLOUCESTER:
Above the rest, be gone.
Old Man:
I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
Old Man:
Come on't what will.
Old Man:
Exit
GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, naked fellow,--
EDGAR:
Poor Tom's a-cold.
EDGAR:
Aside
EDGAR:
I cannot daub it further.
GLOUCESTER:
Come hither, fellow.
EDGAR:
[Aside]  And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
GLOUCESTER:
Know'st thou the way to Dover?
EDGAR:
Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor
EDGAR:
Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
EDGAR:
thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
EDGAR:
fiends have been in poor Tom at once, of lust, as
EDGAR:
Obidicut, Hobbididence, prince of dumbness, Mahu, of
EDGAR:
stealing, Modo, of murder, Flibbertigibbet, of
EDGAR:
mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
EDGAR:
and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!
GLOUCESTER:
Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
GLOUCESTER:
Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
GLOUCESTER:
Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
GLOUCESTER:
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
GLOUCESTER:
That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
GLOUCESTER:
Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly,
GLOUCESTER:
So distribution should undo excess,
GLOUCESTER:
And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
EDGAR:
Ay, master.
GLOUCESTER:
There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
GLOUCESTER:
Looks fearfully in the confined deep
GLOUCESTER:
Bring me but to the very brim of it,
GLOUCESTER:
And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
GLOUCESTER:
With something rich about me: from that place
GLOUCESTER:
I shall no leading need.
EDGAR:
Give me thy arm
EDGAR:
Poor Tom shall lead thee.
EDGAR:
Exeunt
EDGAR:
SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace.
EDGAR:
Enter GONERIL and EDMUND
GONERIL:
Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
GONERIL:
Not met us on the way.
GONERIL:
Enter OSWALD
GONERIL:
Now, where's your master'?
OSWALD:
Madam, within, but never man so changed.
OSWALD:
I told him of the army that was landed,
OSWALD:
He smiled at it: I told him you were coming
OSWALD:
His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
OSWALD:
And of the loyal service of his son,
OSWALD:
When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
OSWALD:
And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out
OSWALD:
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him,
OSWALD:
What like, offensive.
GONERIL:
[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.
GONERIL:
It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
GONERIL:
That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
GONERIL:
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
GONERIL:
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother,
GONERIL:
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers
GONERIL:
I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
GONERIL:
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
GONERIL:
Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
GONERIL:
If you dare venture in your own behalf,
GONERIL:
A mistress's command. Wear this, spare speech,
GONERIL:
Giving a favour
GONERIL:
Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
GONERIL:
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air
GONERIL:
Conceive, and fare thee well.
EDMUND:
Yours in the ranks of death.
GONERIL:
My most dear Gloucester!
GONERIL:
Exit EDMUND
GONERIL:
O, the difference of man and man!
GONERIL:
To thee a woman's services are due
GONERIL:
My fool usurps my body.
OSWALD:
Madam, here comes my lord.
OSWALD:
Exit
OSWALD:
Enter ALBANY
GONERIL:
I have been worth the whistle.
ALBANY:
O Goneril!
ALBANY:
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
ALBANY:
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition
ALBANY:
That nature, which contemns its origin,
ALBANY:
Cannot be border'd certain in itself,
ALBANY:
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
ALBANY:
From her material sap, perforce must wither
ALBANY:
And come to deadly use.
GONERIL:
No more, the text is foolish.
ALBANY:
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile
ALBANY:
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
ALBANY:
Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
ALBANY:
A father, and a gracious aged man,
ALBANY:
Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
ALBANY:
Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
ALBANY:
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
ALBANY:
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
ALBANY:
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
ALBANY:
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
ALBANY:
It will come,
ALBANY:
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
ALBANY:
Like monsters of the deep.
GONERIL:
Milk-liver'd man!
GONERIL:
That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs,
GONERIL:
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
GONERIL:
Thine honour from thy suffering, that not know'st
GONERIL:
Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
GONERIL:
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
GONERIL:
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
GONERIL:
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats,
GONERIL:
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
GONERIL:
'Alack, why does he so?'
ALBANY:
See thyself, devil!
ALBANY:
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
ALBANY:
So horrid as in woman.
GONERIL:
O vain fool!
ALBANY:
Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
ALBANY:
Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
ALBANY:
To let these hands obey my blood,
ALBANY:
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
ALBANY:
Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
ALBANY:
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
GONERIL:
Marry, your manhood now--
GONERIL:
Enter a Messenger
ALBANY:
What news?
Messenger:
O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead
Messenger:
Slain by his servant, going to put out
Messenger:
The other eye of Gloucester.
ALBANY:
Gloucester's eye!
Messenger:
A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
Messenger:
Opposed against the act, bending his sword
Messenger:
To his great master, who, thereat enraged,
Messenger:
Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead,
Messenger:
But not without that harmful stroke, which since
Messenger:
Hath pluck'd him after.
ALBANY:
This shows you are above,
ALBANY:
You justicers, that these our nether crimes
ALBANY:
So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
ALBANY:
Lost he his other eye?
Messenger:
Both, both, my lord.
Messenger:
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer,
Messenger:
'Tis from your sister.
GONERIL:
[Aside]              One way I like this well,
GONERIL:
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
GONERIL:
May all the building in my fancy pluck
GONERIL:
Upon my hateful life: another way,
GONERIL:
The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.
GONERIL:
Exit
ALBANY:
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
Messenger:
Come with my lady hither.
ALBANY:
He is not here.
Messenger:
No, my good lord, I met him back again.
ALBANY:
Knows he the wickedness?
Messenger:
Ay, my good lord, 'twas he inform'd against him,
Messenger:
And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
Messenger:
Might have the freer course.
ALBANY:
Gloucester, I live
ALBANY:
To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
ALBANY:
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend
ALBANY:
Tell me what more thou know'st.
ALBANY:
Exeunt
ALBANY:
SCENE III. The French camp near Dover.
ALBANY:
Enter KENT and a Gentleman
KENT:
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
KENT:
know you the reason?
Gentleman:
Something he left imperfect in the
Gentleman:
state, which since his coming forth is thought
Gentleman:
of, which imports to the kingdom so much
Gentleman:
fear and danger, that his personal return was
Gentleman:
most required and necessary.
KENT:
Who hath he left behind him general?
Gentleman:
The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
KENT:
Did your letters pierce the queen to any
KENT:
demonstration of grief?
Gentleman:
Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my presence,
Gentleman:
And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
Gentleman:
Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
Gentleman:
Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,
Gentleman:
Sought to be king o'er her.
KENT:
O, then it moved her.
Gentleman:
Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
Gentleman:
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
Gentleman:
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
Gentleman:
Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
Gentleman:
That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
Gentleman:
What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence,
Gentleman:
As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
Gentleman:
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
Gentleman:
If all could so become it.
KENT:
Made she no verbal question?
Gentleman:
'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
Gentleman:
Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart
Gentleman:
Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
Gentleman:
Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
Gentleman:
Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
Gentleman:
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
Gentleman:
And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
Gentleman:
To deal with grief alone.
KENT:
It is the stars,
KENT:
The stars above us, govern our conditions,
KENT:
Else one self mate and mate could not beget
KENT:
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
Gentleman:
No.
KENT:
Was this before the king return'd?
Gentleman:
No, since.
KENT:
Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town,
KENT:
Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
KENT:
What we are come about, and by no means
KENT:
Will yield to see his daughter.
Gentleman:
Why, good sir?
KENT:
A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
KENT:
That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
KENT:
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
KENT:
To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
KENT:
His mind so venomously, that burning shame
KENT:
Detains him from Cordelia.
Gentleman:
Alack, poor gentleman!
KENT:
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
Gentleman:
'Tis so, they are afoot.
KENT:
Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
KENT:
And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
KENT:
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile,
KENT:
When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
KENT:
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
KENT:
Along with me.
KENT:
Exeunt
KENT:
SCENE IV. The same. A tent.
KENT:
Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers
CORDELIA:
Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
CORDELIA:
As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud,
CORDELIA:
Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
CORDELIA:
With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
CORDELIA:
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
CORDELIA:
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth,
CORDELIA:
Search every acre in the high-grown field,
CORDELIA:
And bring him to our eye.
CORDELIA:
Exit an Officer
CORDELIA:
What can man's wisdom
CORDELIA:
In the restoring his bereaved sense?
CORDELIA:
He that helps him take all my outward worth.
Doctor:
There is means, madam
Doctor:
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
Doctor:
The which he lacks, that to provoke in him,
Doctor:
Are many simples operative, whose power
Doctor:
Will close the eye of anguish.
CORDELIA:
All blest secrets,
CORDELIA:
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
CORDELIA:
Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
CORDELIA:
In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him,
CORDELIA:
Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
CORDELIA:
That wants the means to lead it.
CORDELIA:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
News, madam,
Messenger:
The British powers are marching hitherward.
CORDELIA:
'Tis known before, our preparation stands
CORDELIA:
In expectation of them. O dear father,
CORDELIA:
It is thy business that I go about,
CORDELIA:
Therefore great France
CORDELIA:
My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
CORDELIA:
No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
CORDELIA:
But love, dear love, and our aged father's right
CORDELIA:
Soon may I hear and see him!
CORDELIA:
Exeunt
CORDELIA:
SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.
CORDELIA:
Enter REGAN and OSWALD
REGAN:
But are my brother's powers set forth?
OSWALD:
Ay, madam.
REGAN:
Himself in person there?
OSWALD:
Madam, with much ado
OSWALD:
Your sister is the better soldier.
REGAN:
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
OSWALD:
No, madam.
REGAN:
What might import my sister's letter to him?
OSWALD:
I know not, lady.
REGAN:
'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
REGAN:
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
REGAN:
To let him live: where he arrives he moves
REGAN:
All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
REGAN:
In pity of his misery, to dispatch
REGAN:
His nighted life: moreover, to descry
REGAN:
The strength o' the enemy.
OSWALD:
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
REGAN:
Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us,
REGAN:
The ways are dangerous.
OSWALD:
I may not, madam
OSWALD:
My lady charged my duty in this business.
REGAN:
Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
REGAN:
Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
REGAN:
Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
REGAN:
Let me unseal the letter.
OSWALD:
Madam, I had rather--
REGAN:
I know your lady does not love her husband,
REGAN:
I am sure of that: and at her late being here
REGAN:
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
REGAN:
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
OSWALD:
I, madam?
REGAN:
I speak in understanding, you are, I know't
REGAN:
Therefore I do advise you, take this note
REGAN:
My lord is dead, Edmund and I have talk'd,
REGAN:
And more convenient is he for my hand
REGAN:
Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
REGAN:
If you do find him, pray you, give him this,
REGAN:
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
REGAN:
I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
REGAN:
So, fare you well.
REGAN:
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
REGAN:
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
OSWALD:
Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
OSWALD:
What party I do follow.
REGAN:
Fare thee well.
REGAN:
Exeunt
REGAN:
SCENE VI. Fields near Dover.
REGAN:
Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant
GLOUCESTER:
When shall we come to the top of that same hill?
EDGAR:
You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.
GLOUCESTER:
Methinks the ground is even.
EDGAR:
Horrible steep.
EDGAR:
Hark, do you hear the sea?
GLOUCESTER:
No, truly.
EDGAR:
Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
EDGAR:
By your eyes' anguish.
GLOUCESTER:
So may it be, indeed
GLOUCESTER:
Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st
GLOUCESTER:
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
EDGAR:
You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
EDGAR:
But in my garments.
GLOUCESTER:
Methinks you're better spoken.
EDGAR:
Come on, sir, here's the place: stand still. How fearful
EDGAR:
And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
EDGAR:
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
EDGAR:
Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
EDGAR:
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
EDGAR:
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head
EDGAR:
The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
EDGAR:
Appear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark,
EDGAR:
Diminish'd to her cock, her cock, a buoy
EDGAR:
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
EDGAR:
That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
EDGAR:
Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,
EDGAR:
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
EDGAR:
Topple down headlong.
GLOUCESTER:
Set me where you stand.
EDGAR:
Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
EDGAR:
Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
EDGAR:
Would I not leap upright.
GLOUCESTER:
Let go my hand.
GLOUCESTER:
Here, friend, 's another purse, in it a jewel
GLOUCESTER:
Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
GLOUCESTER:
Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off,
GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
EDGAR:
Now fare you well, good sir.
GLOUCESTER:
With all my heart.
EDGAR:
Why I do trifle thus with his despair
EDGAR:
Is done to cure it.
GLOUCESTER:
[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!
GLOUCESTER:
This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
GLOUCESTER:
Shake patiently my great affliction off
GLOUCESTER:
If I could bear it longer, and not fall
GLOUCESTER:
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
GLOUCESTER:
My snuff and loathed part of nature should
GLOUCESTER:
Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
GLOUCESTER:
Now, fellow, fare thee well.
GLOUCESTER:
He falls forward
EDGAR:
Gone, sir: farewell.
EDGAR:
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
EDGAR:
The treasury of life, when life itself
EDGAR:
Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
EDGAR:
By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
EDGAR:
Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
EDGAR:
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
EDGAR:
What are you, sir?
GLOUCESTER:
Away, and let me die.
EDGAR:
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
EDGAR:
So many fathom down precipitating,
EDGAR:
Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe,
EDGAR:
Hast heavy substance, bleed'st not, speak'st, art sound.
EDGAR:
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
EDGAR:
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell
EDGAR:
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
GLOUCESTER:
But have I fall'n, or no?
EDGAR:
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
EDGAR:
Look up a-height, the shrill-gorged lark so far
EDGAR:
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
GLOUCESTER:
Alack, I have no eyes.
GLOUCESTER:
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
GLOUCESTER:
To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
GLOUCESTER:
When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
GLOUCESTER:
And frustrate his proud will.
EDGAR:
Give me your arm
EDGAR:
Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
GLOUCESTER:
Too well, too well.
EDGAR:
This is above all strangeness.
EDGAR:
Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
EDGAR:
Which parted from you?
GLOUCESTER:
A poor unfortunate beggar.
EDGAR:
As I stood here below, methought his eyes
EDGAR:
Were two full moons, he had a thousand noses,
EDGAR:
Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea
EDGAR:
It was some fiend, therefore, thou happy father,
EDGAR:
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
EDGAR:
Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.
GLOUCESTER:
I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
GLOUCESTER:
Affliction till it do cry out itself
GLOUCESTER:
'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
GLOUCESTER:
I took it for a man, often 'twould say
GLOUCESTER:
'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.
EDGAR:
Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
EDGAR:
Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers
EDGAR:
The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
EDGAR:
His master thus.
KING LEAR:
No, they cannot touch me for coining, I am the
KING LEAR:
king himself.
EDGAR:
O thou side-piercing sight!
KING LEAR:
Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
KING LEAR:
press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
KING LEAR:
crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
KING LEAR:
look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted
KING LEAR:
cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet, I'll prove
KING LEAR:
it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
KING LEAR:
flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
KING LEAR:
Give the word.
EDGAR:
Sweet marjoram.
KING LEAR:
Pass.
GLOUCESTER:
I know that voice.
KING LEAR:
Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
KING LEAR:
me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my
KING LEAR:
beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
KING LEAR:
and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
KING LEAR:
too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
KING LEAR:
wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter, when
KING LEAR:
the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I
KING LEAR:
found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are
KING LEAR:
not men o' their words: they told me I was every
KING LEAR:
thing, 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
GLOUCESTER:
The trick of that voice I do well remember
GLOUCESTER:
Is 't not the king?
KING LEAR:
Ay, every inch a king
KING LEAR:
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
KING LEAR:
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
KING LEAR:
Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No
KING LEAR:
The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
KING LEAR:
Does lecher in my sight.
KING LEAR:
Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester's bastard son
KING LEAR:
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
KING LEAR:
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
KING LEAR:
To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
KING LEAR:
Behold yond simpering dame,
KING LEAR:
Whose face between her forks presages snow,
KING LEAR:
That minces virtue, and does shake the head
KING LEAR:
To hear of pleasure's name,
KING LEAR:
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
KING LEAR:
With a more riotous appetite.
KING LEAR:
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
KING LEAR:
Though women all above
KING LEAR:
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
KING LEAR:
Beneath is all the fiends',
KING LEAR:
There's hell, there's darkness, there's the
KING LEAR:
sulphurous pit,
KING LEAR:
Burning, scalding, stench, consumption, fie,
KING LEAR:
fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
KING LEAR:
good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination
KING LEAR:
there's money for thee.
GLOUCESTER:
O, let me kiss that hand!
KING LEAR:
Let me wipe it first, it smells of mortality.
GLOUCESTER:
O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
GLOUCESTER:
Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
KING LEAR:
I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
KING LEAR:
at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not
KING LEAR:
love. Read thou this challenge, mark but the
KING LEAR:
penning of it.
GLOUCESTER:
Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
EDGAR:
I would not take this from report, it is,
EDGAR:
And my heart breaks at it.
KING LEAR:
Read.
GLOUCESTER:
What, with the case of eyes?
KING LEAR:
O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
KING LEAR:
head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
KING LEAR:
a heavy case, your purse in a light, yet you see how
KING LEAR:
this world goes.
GLOUCESTER:
I see it feelingly.
KING LEAR:
What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes
KING LEAR:
with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
KING LEAR:
justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
KING LEAR:
thine ear: change places, and, handy-dandy, which
KING LEAR:
is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
KING LEAR:
a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, sir.
KING LEAR:
And the creature run from the cur? There thou
KING LEAR:
mightst behold the great image of authority: a
KING LEAR:
dog's obeyed in office.
KING LEAR:
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
KING LEAR:
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back,
KING LEAR:
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
KING LEAR:
For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
KING LEAR:
Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear,
KING LEAR:
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
KING LEAR:
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks
KING LEAR:
Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
KING LEAR:
None does offend, none, I say, none, I'll able 'em
KING LEAR:
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
KING LEAR:
To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes,
KING LEAR:
And like a scurvy politician, seem
KING LEAR:
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now
KING LEAR:
Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.
EDGAR:
O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!
KING LEAR:
If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
KING LEAR:
I know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester
KING LEAR:
Thou must be patient, we came crying hither
KING LEAR:
Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
KING LEAR:
We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.
GLOUCESTER:
Alack, alack the day!
KING LEAR:
When we are born, we cry that we are come
KING LEAR:
To this great stage of fools: this a good block,
KING LEAR:
It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
KING LEAR:
A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof,
KING LEAR:
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
KING LEAR:
Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
KING LEAR:
Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants
Gentleman:
O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,
Gentleman:
Your most dear daughter--
KING LEAR:
No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
KING LEAR:
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well,
KING LEAR:
You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons,
KING LEAR:
I am cut to the brains.
Gentleman:
You shall have any thing.
KING LEAR:
No seconds? all myself?
KING LEAR:
Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
KING LEAR:
To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
KING LEAR:
Ay, and laying autumn's dust.
Gentleman:
Good sir,--
KING LEAR:
I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!
KING LEAR:
I will be jovial: come, come, I am a king,
KING LEAR:
My masters, know you that.
Gentleman:
You are a royal one, and we obey you.
KING LEAR:
Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you
KING LEAR:
shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.
KING LEAR:
Exit running, Attendants follow
Gentleman:
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
Gentleman:
Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
Gentleman:
Who redeems nature from the general curse
Gentleman:
Which twain have brought her to.
EDGAR:
Hail, gentle sir.
Gentleman:
Sir, speed you: what's your will?
EDGAR:
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
Gentleman:
Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,
Gentleman:
Which can distinguish sound.
EDGAR:
But, by your favour,
EDGAR:
How near's the other army?
Gentleman:
Near and on speedy foot, the main descry
Gentleman:
Stands on the hourly thought.
EDGAR:
I thank you, sir: that's all.
Gentleman:
Though that the queen on special cause is here,
Gentleman:
Her army is moved on.
EDGAR:
I thank you, sir.
EDGAR:
Exit Gentleman
GLOUCESTER:
You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me
GLOUCESTER:
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
GLOUCESTER:
To die before you please!
EDGAR:
Well pray you, father.
GLOUCESTER:
Now, good sir, what are you?
EDGAR:
A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,
EDGAR:
Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
EDGAR:
Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
EDGAR:
I'll lead you to some biding.
GLOUCESTER:
Hearty thanks
GLOUCESTER:
The bounty and the benison of heaven
GLOUCESTER:
To boot, and boot!
GLOUCESTER:
Enter OSWALD
OSWALD:
A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
OSWALD:
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh
OSWALD:
To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
OSWALD:
Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out
OSWALD:
That must destroy thee.
GLOUCESTER:
Now let thy friendly hand
GLOUCESTER:
Put strength enough to't.
GLOUCESTER:
EDGAR interposes
OSWALD:
Wherefore, bold peasant,
OSWALD:
Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence,
OSWALD:
Lest that the infection of his fortune take
OSWALD:
Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
EDGAR:
Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.
OSWALD:
Let go, slave, or thou diest!
EDGAR:
Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk
EDGAR:
pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,
EDGAR:
'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.
EDGAR:
Nay, come not near th' old man, keep out, che vor
EDGAR:
ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
EDGAR:
the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.
OSWALD:
Out, dunghill!
EDGAR:
Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come, no matter vor
EDGAR:
your foins.
EDGAR:
They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down
OSWALD:
Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse
OSWALD:
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,
OSWALD:
And give the letters which thou find'st about me
OSWALD:
To Edmund earl of Gloucester, seek him out
OSWALD:
Upon the British party: O, untimely death!
OSWALD:
Dies
EDGAR:
I know thee well: a serviceable villain,
EDGAR:
As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
EDGAR:
As badness would desire.
GLOUCESTER:
What, is he dead?
EDGAR:
Sit you down, father, rest you
EDGAR:
Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
EDGAR:
May be my friends. He's dead, I am only sorry
EDGAR:
He had no other death's-man. Let us see
EDGAR:
Leave, gentle wax, and, manners, blame us not
EDGAR:
To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts,
EDGAR:
Their papers, is more lawful.
EDGAR:
Reads
EDGAR:
'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have
EDGAR:
many opportunities to cut him off: if your will
EDGAR:
want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
EDGAR:
There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror
EDGAR:
then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal, from
EDGAR:
the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
EDGAR:
the place for your labour.
EDGAR:
'Your--wife, so I would say--
EDGAR:
'Affectionate servant,
EDGAR:
'GONERIL.'
EDGAR:
O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!
EDGAR:
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
EDGAR:
And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
EDGAR:
Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
EDGAR:
Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
EDGAR:
With this ungracious paper strike the sight
EDGAR:
Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well
EDGAR:
That of thy death and business I can tell.
GLOUCESTER:
The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
GLOUCESTER:
That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
GLOUCESTER:
Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract
GLOUCESTER:
So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
GLOUCESTER:
And woes by wrong imaginations lose
GLOUCESTER:
The knowledge of themselves.
EDGAR:
Give me your hand
EDGAR:
Drum afar off
EDGAR:
Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum
EDGAR:
Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.
EDGAR:
Exeunt
EDGAR:
SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,
EDGAR:
soft music playing, Gentleman, and others attending.
EDGAR:
Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor
CORDELIA:
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
CORDELIA:
To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
CORDELIA:
And every measure fail me.
KENT:
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
KENT:
All my reports go with the modest truth,
KENT:
Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.
CORDELIA:
Be better suited
CORDELIA:
These weeds are memories of those worser hours
CORDELIA:
I prithee, put them off.
KENT:
Pardon me, dear madam,
KENT:
Yet to be known shortens my made intent
KENT:
My boon I make it, that you know me not
KENT:
Till time and I think meet.
CORDELIA:
Then be't so, my good lord.
CORDELIA:
To the Doctor
CORDELIA:
How does the king?
Doctor:
Madam, sleeps still.
CORDELIA:
O you kind gods,
CORDELIA:
Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
CORDELIA:
The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
CORDELIA:
Of this child-changed father!
Doctor:
So please your majesty
Doctor:
That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.
CORDELIA:
Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
CORDELIA:
I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?
Gentleman:
Ay, madam, in the heaviness of his sleep
Gentleman:
We put fresh garments on him.
Doctor:
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him,
Doctor:
I doubt not of his temperance.
CORDELIA:
Very well.
Doctor:
Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!
CORDELIA:
O my dear father! Restoration hang
CORDELIA:
Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss
CORDELIA:
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
CORDELIA:
Have in thy reverence made!
KENT:
Kind and dear princess!
CORDELIA:
Had you not been their father, these white flakes
CORDELIA:
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
CORDELIA:
To be opposed against the warring winds?
CORDELIA:
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
CORDELIA:
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
CORDELIA:
Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
CORDELIA:
With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
CORDELIA:
Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
CORDELIA:
Against my fire, and wast thou fain, poor father,
CORDELIA:
To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
CORDELIA:
In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
CORDELIA:
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
CORDELIA:
Had not concluded all. He wakes, speak to him.
Doctor:
Madam, do you, 'tis fittest.
CORDELIA:
How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?
KING LEAR:
You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave
KING LEAR:
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound
KING LEAR:
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
KING LEAR:
Do scald like moulten lead.
CORDELIA:
Sir, do you know me?
KING LEAR:
You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?
CORDELIA:
Still, still, far wide!
Doctor:
He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.
KING LEAR:
Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
KING LEAR:
I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
KING LEAR:
To see another thus. I know not what to say.
KING LEAR:
I will not swear these are my hands: let's see,
KING LEAR:
I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
KING LEAR:
Of my condition!
CORDELIA:
O, look upon me, sir,
CORDELIA:
And hold your hands in benediction o'er me
CORDELIA:
No, sir, you must not kneel.
KING LEAR:
Pray, do not mock me
KING LEAR:
I am a very foolish fond old man,
KING LEAR:
Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less,
KING LEAR:
And, to deal plainly,
KING LEAR:
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
KING LEAR:
Methinks I should know you, and know this man,
KING LEAR:
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
KING LEAR:
What place this is, and all the skill I have
KING LEAR:
Remembers not these garments, nor I know not
KING LEAR:
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me,
KING LEAR:
For, as I am a man, I think this lady
KING LEAR:
To be my child Cordelia.
CORDELIA:
And so I am, I am.
KING LEAR:
Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not
KING LEAR:
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
KING LEAR:
I know you do not love me, for your sisters
KING LEAR:
Have, as I do remember, done me wrong
KING LEAR:
You have some cause, they have not.
CORDELIA:
No cause, no cause.
KING LEAR:
Am I in France?
KENT:
In your own kingdom, sir.
KING LEAR:
Do not abuse me.
Doctor:
Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
Doctor:
You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
Doctor:
To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
Doctor:
Desire him to go in, trouble him no more
Doctor:
Till further settling.
CORDELIA:
Will't please your highness walk?
KING LEAR:
You must bear with me
KING LEAR:
Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
KING LEAR:
Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman
Gentleman:
Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
KENT:
Most certain, sir.
Gentleman:
Who is conductor of his people?
KENT:
As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
Gentleman:
They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
Gentleman:
of Kent in Germany.
KENT:
Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about, the
KENT:
powers of the kingdom approach apace.
Gentleman:
The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
Gentleman:
well, sir.
Gentleman:
Exit
KENT:
My point and period will be throughly wrought,
KENT:
Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.
KENT:
Exit
KENT:
ACT V
KENT:
SCENE I. The British camp, near Dover.
KENT:
Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.
EDMUND:
Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
EDMUND:
Or whether since he is advised by aught
EDMUND:
To change the course: he's full of alteration
EDMUND:
And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.
EDMUND:
To a Gentleman, who goes out
REGAN:
Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
EDMUND:
'Tis to be doubted, madam.
REGAN:
Now, sweet lord,
REGAN:
You know the goodness I intend upon you
REGAN:
Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
REGAN:
Do you not love my sister?
EDMUND:
In honour'd love.
REGAN:
But have you never found my brother's way
REGAN:
To the forfended place?
EDMUND:
That thought abuses you.
REGAN:
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
REGAN:
And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
EDMUND:
No, by mine honour, madam.
REGAN:
I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
REGAN:
Be not familiar with her.
EDMUND:
Fear me not
EDMUND:
She and the duke her husband!
EDMUND:
Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers
GONERIL:
[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sister
GONERIL:
Should loosen him and me.
ALBANY:
Our very loving sister, well be-met.
ALBANY:
Sir, this I hear, the king is come to his daughter,
ALBANY:
With others whom the rigor of our state
ALBANY:
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
ALBANY:
I never yet was valiant: for this business,
ALBANY:
It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
ALBANY:
Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
ALBANY:
Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
EDMUND:
Sir, you speak nobly.
REGAN:
Why is this reason'd?
GONERIL:
Combine together 'gainst the enemy,
GONERIL:
For these domestic and particular broils
GONERIL:
Are not the question here.
ALBANY:
Let's then determine
ALBANY:
With the ancient of war on our proceedings.
EDMUND:
I shall attend you presently at your tent.
REGAN:
Sister, you'll go with us?
GONERIL:
No.
REGAN:
'Tis most convenient, pray you, go with us.
GONERIL:
[Aside]  O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.
GONERIL:
As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised
EDGAR:
If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
EDGAR:
Hear me one word.
ALBANY:
I'll overtake you. Speak.
ALBANY:
Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR
EDGAR:
Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
EDGAR:
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
EDGAR:
For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
EDGAR:
I can produce a champion that will prove
EDGAR:
What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
EDGAR:
Your business of the world hath so an end,
EDGAR:
And machination ceases. Fortune love you.
ALBANY:
Stay till I have read the letter.
EDGAR:
I was forbid it.
EDGAR:
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
EDGAR:
And I'll appear again.
ALBANY:
Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.
ALBANY:
Exit EDGAR
ALBANY:
Re-enter EDMUND
EDMUND:
The enemy's in view, draw up your powers.
EDMUND:
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
EDMUND:
By diligent discovery, but your haste
EDMUND:
Is now urged on you.
ALBANY:
We will greet the time.
ALBANY:
Exit
EDMUND:
To both these sisters have I sworn my love,
EDMUND:
Each jealous of the other, as the stung
EDMUND:
Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
EDMUND:
Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
EDMUND:
If both remain alive: to take the widow
EDMUND:
Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril,
EDMUND:
And hardly shall I carry out my side,
EDMUND:
Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
EDMUND:
His countenance for the battle, which being done,
EDMUND:
Let her who would be rid of him devise
EDMUND:
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
EDMUND:
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
EDMUND:
The battle done, and they within our power,
EDMUND:
Shall never see his pardon, for my state
EDMUND:
Stands on me to defend, not to debate.
EDMUND:
Exit
EDMUND:
SCENE II. A field between the two camps.
EDMUND:
Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours,  KING LEAR, CORDELIA, and Soldiers, over the stage, and exeunt
EDMUND:
Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER
EDGAR:
Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
EDGAR:
For your good host, pray that the right may thrive
EDGAR:
If ever I return to you again,
EDGAR:
I'll bring you comfort.
GLOUCESTER:
Grace go with you, sir!
GLOUCESTER:
Exit EDGAR
GLOUCESTER:
Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR
EDGAR:
Away, old man, give me thy hand, away!
EDGAR:
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en
EDGAR:
Give me thy hand, come on.
GLOUCESTER:
No farther, sir, a man may rot even here.
EDGAR:
What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
EDGAR:
Their going hence, even as their coming hither,
EDGAR:
Ripeness is all: come on.
GLOUCESTER:
And that's true too.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE III. The British camp near Dover.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND,  KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners, Captain, Soldiers,  and c
EDMUND:
Some officers take them away: good guard,
EDMUND:
Until their greater pleasures first be known
EDMUND:
That are to censure them.
CORDELIA:
We are not the first
CORDELIA:
Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
CORDELIA:
For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down,
CORDELIA:
Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
CORDELIA:
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
KING LEAR:
No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison
KING LEAR:
We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage
KING LEAR:
When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
KING LEAR:
And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
KING LEAR:
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
KING LEAR:
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
KING LEAR:
Talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too,
KING LEAR:
Who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out,
KING LEAR:
And take upon's the mystery of things,
KING LEAR:
As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
KING LEAR:
In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
KING LEAR:
That ebb and flow by the moon.
EDMUND:
Take them away.
KING LEAR:
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
KING LEAR:
The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
KING LEAR:
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
KING LEAR:
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes,
KING LEAR:
The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
KING LEAR:
Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve
KING LEAR:
first. Come.
KING LEAR:
Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded
EDMUND:
Come hither, captain, hark.
EDMUND:
Take thou this note,
EDMUND:
Giving a paper
EDMUND:
go follow them to prison
EDMUND:
One step I have advanced thee, if thou dost
EDMUND:
As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
EDMUND:
To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
EDMUND:
Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
EDMUND:
Does not become a sword: thy great employment
EDMUND:
Will not bear question, either say thou'lt do 't,
EDMUND:
Or thrive by other means.
Captain:
I'll do 't, my lord.
EDMUND:
About it, and write happy when thou hast done.
EDMUND:
Mark, I say, instantly, and carry it so
EDMUND:
As I have set it down.
Captain:
I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats,
Captain:
If it be man's work, I'll do 't.
Captain:
Exit
Captain:
Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers
ALBANY:
Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
ALBANY:
And fortune led you well: you have the captives
ALBANY:
That were the opposites of this day's strife
ALBANY:
We do require them of you, so to use them
ALBANY:
As we shall find their merits and our safety
ALBANY:
May equally determine.
EDMUND:
Sir, I thought it fit
EDMUND:
To send the old and miserable king
EDMUND:
To some retention and appointed guard,
EDMUND:
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
EDMUND:
To pluck the common bosom on his side,
EDMUND:
An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
EDMUND:
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen,
EDMUND:
My reason all the same, and they are ready
EDMUND:
To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
EDMUND:
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
EDMUND:
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend,
EDMUND:
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
EDMUND:
By those that feel their sharpness
EDMUND:
The question of Cordelia and her father
EDMUND:
Requires a fitter place.
ALBANY:
Sir, by your patience,
ALBANY:
I hold you but a subject of this war,
ALBANY:
Not as a brother.
REGAN:
That's as we list to grace him.
REGAN:
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
REGAN:
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,
REGAN:
Bore the commission of my place and person,
REGAN:
The which immediacy may well stand up,
REGAN:
And call itself your brother.
GONERIL:
Not so hot
GONERIL:
In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
GONERIL:
More than in your addition.
REGAN:
In my rights,
REGAN:
By me invested, he compeers the best.
GONERIL:
That were the most, if he should husband you.
REGAN:
Jesters do oft prove prophets.
GONERIL:
Holla, holla!
GONERIL:
That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.
REGAN:
Lady, I am not well, else I should answer
REGAN:
From a full-flowing stomach. General,
REGAN:
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony,
REGAN:
Dispose of them, of me, the walls are thine
REGAN:
Witness the world, that I create thee here
REGAN:
My lord and master.
GONERIL:
Mean you to enjoy him?
ALBANY:
The let-alone lies not in your good will.
EDMUND:
Nor in thine, lord.
ALBANY:
Half-blooded fellow, yes.
REGAN:
[To EDMUND]  Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
ALBANY:
Stay yet, hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
ALBANY:
On capital treason, and, in thine attaint,
ALBANY:
This gilded serpent
ALBANY:
Pointing to Goneril
ALBANY:
For your claim, fair sister,
ALBANY:
I bar it in the interest of my wife
ALBANY:
'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
ALBANY:
And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
ALBANY:
If you will marry, make your loves to me,
ALBANY:
My lady is bespoke.
GONERIL:
An interlude!
ALBANY:
Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound
ALBANY:
If none appear to prove upon thy head
ALBANY:
Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
ALBANY:
There is my pledge,
ALBANY:
Throwing down a glove
ALBANY:
I'll prove it on thy heart,
ALBANY:
Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
ALBANY:
Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
REGAN:
Sick, O, sick!
GONERIL:
[Aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
EDMUND:
There's my exchange
EDMUND:
Throwing down a glove
EDMUND:
what in the world he is
EDMUND:
That names me traitor, villain-like he lies
EDMUND:
Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
EDMUND:
On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
EDMUND:
My truth and honour firmly.
ALBANY:
A herald, ho!
EDMUND:
A herald, ho, a herald!
ALBANY:
Trust to thy single virtue, for thy soldiers,
ALBANY:
All levied in my name, have in my name
ALBANY:
Took their discharge.
REGAN:
My sickness grows upon me.
ALBANY:
She is not well, convey her to  my tent.
ALBANY:
Exit Regan, led
ALBANY:
Enter a Herald
ALBANY:
Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,
ALBANY:
And read out this.
Captain:
Sound, trumpet!
Captain:
A trumpet sounds
Herald:
[Reads]  'If any man of quality or degree within
Herald:
the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,
Herald:
supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold
Herald:
traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the
Herald:
trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'
EDMUND:
Sound!
EDMUND:
First trumpet
Herald:
Again!
Herald:
Second trumpet
Herald:
Again!
Herald:
Third trumpet
Herald:
Trumpet answers within
Herald:
Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet before him
ALBANY:
Ask him his purposes, why he appears
ALBANY:
Upon this call o' the trumpet.
Herald:
What are you?
Herald:
Your name, your quality? and why you answer
Herald:
This present summons?
EDGAR:
Know, my name is lost,
EDGAR:
By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit
EDGAR:
Yet am I noble as the adversary
EDGAR:
I come to cope.
ALBANY:
Which is that adversary?
EDGAR:
What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
EDMUND:
Himself: what say'st thou to him?
EDGAR:
Draw thy sword,
EDGAR:
That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
EDGAR:
Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
EDGAR:
Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
EDGAR:
My oath, and my profession: I protest,
EDGAR:
Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
EDGAR:
Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
EDGAR:
Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor,
EDGAR:
False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father,
EDGAR:
Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince,
EDGAR:
And, from the extremest upward of thy head
EDGAR:
To the descent and dust below thy foot,
EDGAR:
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
EDGAR:
This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
EDGAR:
To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
EDGAR:
Thou liest.
EDMUND:
In wisdom I should ask thy name,
EDMUND:
But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
EDMUND:
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
EDMUND:
What safe and nicely I might well delay
EDMUND:
By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn
EDMUND:
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head,
EDMUND:
With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart,
EDMUND:
Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
EDMUND:
This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
EDMUND:
Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
EDMUND:
Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls
ALBANY:
Save him, save him!
GONERIL:
This is practise, Gloucester
GONERIL:
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
GONERIL:
An unknown opposite, thou art not vanquish'd,
GONERIL:
But cozen'd and beguiled.
ALBANY:
Shut your mouth, dame,
ALBANY:
Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir
ALBANY:
Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil
ALBANY:
No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.
ALBANY:
Gives the letter to EDMUND
GONERIL:
Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine
GONERIL:
Who can arraign me for't.
ALBANY:
Most monstrous! oh!
ALBANY:
Know'st thou this paper?
GONERIL:
Ask me not what I know.
GONERIL:
Exit
ALBANY:
Go after her: she's desperate, govern her.
EDMUND:
What you have charged me with, that have I done,
EDMUND:
And more, much more, the time will bring it out
EDMUND:
'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
EDMUND:
That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
EDMUND:
I do forgive thee.
EDGAR:
Let's exchange charity.
EDGAR:
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund,
EDGAR:
If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
EDGAR:
My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
EDGAR:
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
EDGAR:
Make instruments to plague us
EDGAR:
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
EDGAR:
Cost him his eyes.
EDMUND:
Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true,
EDMUND:
The wheel is come full circle: I am here.
ALBANY:
Methought thy very gait did prophesy
ALBANY:
A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee
ALBANY:
Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
ALBANY:
Did hate thee or thy father!
EDGAR:
Worthy prince, I know't.
ALBANY:
Where have you hid yourself?
ALBANY:
How have you known the miseries of your father?
EDGAR:
By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale,
EDGAR:
And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
EDGAR:
The bloody proclamation to escape,
EDGAR:
That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
EDGAR:
That we the pain of death would hourly die
EDGAR:
Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
EDGAR:
Into a madman's rags, to assume a semblance
EDGAR:
That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
EDGAR:
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
EDGAR:
Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
EDGAR:
Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair,
EDGAR:
Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
EDGAR:
Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd
EDGAR:
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
EDGAR:
I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
EDGAR:
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
EDGAR:
Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
EDGAR:
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
EDGAR:
Burst smilingly.
EDMUND:
This speech of yours hath moved me,
EDMUND:
And shall perchance do good: but speak you on,
EDMUND:
You look as you had something more to say.
ALBANY:
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in,
ALBANY:
For I am almost ready to dissolve,
ALBANY:
Hearing of this.
EDGAR:
This would have seem'd a period
EDGAR:
To such as love not sorrow, but another,
EDGAR:
To amplify too much, would make much more,
EDGAR:
And top extremity.
EDGAR:
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
EDGAR:
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
EDGAR:
Shunn'd my abhorr'd society, but then, finding
EDGAR:
Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
EDGAR:
He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
EDGAR:
As he'ld burst heaven, threw him on my father,
EDGAR:
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
EDGAR:
That ever ear received: which in recounting
EDGAR:
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
EDGAR:
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
EDGAR:
And there I left him tranced.
ALBANY:
But who was this?
EDGAR:
Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent, who in disguise
EDGAR:
Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
EDGAR:
Improper for a slave.
EDGAR:
Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife
Gentleman:
Help, help, O, help!
EDGAR:
What kind of help?
ALBANY:
Speak, man.
EDGAR:
What means that bloody knife?
Gentleman:
'Tis hot, it smokes,
Gentleman:
It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!
ALBANY:
Who dead? speak, man.
Gentleman:
Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
Gentleman:
By her is poisoned, she hath confess'd it.
EDMUND:
I was contracted to them both: all three
EDMUND:
Now marry in an instant.
EDGAR:
Here comes Kent.
ALBANY:
Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead
ALBANY:
This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
ALBANY:
Touches us not with pity.
ALBANY:
Exit Gentleman
ALBANY:
Enter KENT
ALBANY:
O, is this he?
ALBANY:
The time will not allow the compliment
ALBANY:
Which very manners urges.
KENT:
I am come
KENT:
To bid my king and master aye good night
KENT:
Is he not here?
ALBANY:
Great thing of us forgot!
ALBANY:
Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
ALBANY:
See'st thou this object, Kent?
ALBANY:
The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in
KENT:
Alack, why thus?
EDMUND:
Yet Edmund was beloved
EDMUND:
The one the other poison'd for my sake,
EDMUND:
And after slew herself.
ALBANY:
Even so. Cover their faces.
EDMUND:
I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
EDMUND:
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
EDMUND:
Be brief in it, to the castle, for my writ
EDMUND:
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia
EDMUND:
Nay, send in time.
ALBANY:
Run, run, O, run!
EDGAR:
To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
EDGAR:
Thy token of reprieve.
EDMUND:
Well thought on: take my sword,
EDMUND:
Give it the captain.
ALBANY:
Haste thee, for thy life.
ALBANY:
Exit EDGAR
EDMUND:
He hath commission from thy wife and me
EDMUND:
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
EDMUND:
To lay the blame upon her own despair,
EDMUND:
That she fordid herself.
ALBANY:
The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
ALBANY:
EDMUND is borne off
ALBANY:
Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms, EDGAR, Captain, and others following
KING LEAR:
Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones
KING LEAR:
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
KING LEAR:
That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
KING LEAR:
I know when one is dead, and when one lives,
KING LEAR:
She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass,
KING LEAR:
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
KING LEAR:
Why, then she lives.
KENT:
Is this the promised end
EDGAR:
Or image of that horror?
ALBANY:
Fall, and cease!
KING LEAR:
This feather stirs, she lives! if it be so,
KING LEAR:
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
KING LEAR:
That ever I have felt.
KENT:
[Kneeling]  O my good master!
KING LEAR:
Prithee, away.
EDGAR:
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
KING LEAR:
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
KING LEAR:
I might have saved her, now she's gone for ever!
KING LEAR:
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
KING LEAR:
What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
KING LEAR:
Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
KING LEAR:
I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
Captain:
'Tis true, my lords, he did.
KING LEAR:
Did I not, fellow?
KING LEAR:
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
KING LEAR:
I would have made them skip: I am old now,
KING LEAR:
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
KING LEAR:
Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
KENT:
If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
KENT:
One of them we behold.
KING LEAR:
This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
KENT:
The same,
KENT:
Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?
KING LEAR:
He's a good fellow, I can tell you that,
KING LEAR:
He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.
KENT:
No, my good lord, I am the very man,--
KING LEAR:
I'll see that straight.
KENT:
That, from your first of difference and decay,
KENT:
Have follow'd your sad steps.
KING LEAR:
You are welcome hither.
KENT:
Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
KENT:
Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
KENT:
And desperately are dead.
KING LEAR:
Ay, so I think.
ALBANY:
He knows not what he says: and vain it is
ALBANY:
That we present us to him.
EDGAR:
Very bootless.
EDGAR:
Enter a Captain
Captain:
Edmund is dead, my lord.
ALBANY:
That's but a trifle here.
ALBANY:
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
ALBANY:
What comfort to this great decay may come
ALBANY:
Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
ALBANY:
During the life of this old majesty,
ALBANY:
To him our absolute power
ALBANY:
To EDGAR and KENT
ALBANY:
you, to your rights
ALBANY:
With boot, and such addition as your honours
ALBANY:
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
ALBANY:
The wages of their virtue, and all foes
ALBANY:
The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!
KING LEAR:
And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
KING LEAR:
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
KING LEAR:
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
KING LEAR:
Never, never, never, never, never!
KING LEAR:
Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
KING LEAR:
Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
KING LEAR:
Look there, look there!
KING LEAR:
Dies
EDGAR:
He faints! My lord, my lord!
KENT:
Break, heart, I prithee, break!
EDGAR:
Look up, my lord.
KENT:
Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
KENT:
That would upon the rack of this tough world
KENT:
Stretch him out longer.
EDGAR:
He is gone, indeed.
KENT:
The wonder is, he hath endured so long
KENT:
He but usurp'd his life.
ALBANY:
Bear them from hence. Our present business
ALBANY:
Is general woe.
ALBANY:
To KENT and EDGAR
ALBANY:
Friends of my soul, you twain
ALBANY:
Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
KENT:
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go,
KENT:
My master calls me, I must not say no.
ALBANY:
The weight of this sad time we must obey,
ALBANY:
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
ALBANY:
The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
ALBANY:
Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
ALBANY:
Exeunt, with a dead march
