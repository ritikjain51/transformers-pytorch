ACT I
Clown:
SCENE I. Verona. An open place.
Clown:
Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
VALENTINE:
Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus
VALENTINE:
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
VALENTINE:
Were't not affection chains thy tender days
VALENTINE:
To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
VALENTINE:
I rather would entreat thy company
VALENTINE:
To see the wonders of the world abroad,
VALENTINE:
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
VALENTINE:
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
VALENTINE:
But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
VALENTINE:
Even as I would when I to love begin.
PROTEUS:
Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
PROTEUS:
Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
PROTEUS:
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel
PROTEUS:
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
PROTEUS:
When thou dost meet good hap, and in thy danger,
PROTEUS:
If ever danger do environ thee,
PROTEUS:
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
PROTEUS:
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
And on a love-book pray for my success?
PROTEUS:
Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
VALENTINE:
That's on some shallow story of deep love
VALENTINE:
How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
PROTEUS:
That's a deep story of a deeper love
PROTEUS:
For he was more than over shoes in love.
VALENTINE:
'Tis true, for you are over boots in love,
VALENTINE:
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
PROTEUS:
Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
VALENTINE:
No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
PROTEUS:
What?
VALENTINE:
To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,
VALENTINE:
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment's mirth
VALENTINE:
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights
VALENTINE:
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain,
VALENTINE:
If lost, why then a grievous labour won,
VALENTINE:
However, but a folly bought with wit,
VALENTINE:
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
PROTEUS:
So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
VALENTINE:
So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
PROTEUS:
'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
VALENTINE:
Love is your master, for he masters you
VALENTINE:
And he that is so yoked by a fool,
VALENTINE:
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
PROTEUS:
Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
PROTEUS:
The eating canker dwells, so eating love
PROTEUS:
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
VALENTINE:
And writers say, as the most forward bud
VALENTINE:
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
VALENTINE:
Even so by love the young and tender wit
VALENTINE:
Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
VALENTINE:
Losing his verdure even in the prime
VALENTINE:
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
VALENTINE:
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
VALENTINE:
That art a votary to fond desire?
VALENTINE:
Once more adieu! my father at the road
VALENTINE:
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
PROTEUS:
And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
Sweet Proteus, no, now let us take our leave.
VALENTINE:
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
VALENTINE:
Of thy success in love, and what news else
VALENTINE:
Betideth here in absence of thy friend,
VALENTINE:
And likewise will visit thee with mine.
PROTEUS:
All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
VALENTINE:
As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
VALENTINE:
Exit
PROTEUS:
He after honour hunts, I after love
PROTEUS:
He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
PROTEUS:
I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
PROTEUS:
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
PROTEUS:
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
PROTEUS:
War with good counsel, set the world at nought,
PROTEUS:
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
PROTEUS:
Enter SPEED
SPEED:
Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
PROTEUS:
But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.
SPEED:
Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
SPEED:
And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
PROTEUS:
Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
PROTEUS:
An if the shepherd be a while away.
SPEED:
You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
SPEED:
and I a sheep?
PROTEUS:
I do.
SPEED:
Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
PROTEUS:
A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
SPEED:
This proves me still a sheep.
PROTEUS:
True, and thy master a shepherd.
SPEED:
Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
PROTEUS:
It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
SPEED:
The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
SPEED:
shepherd, but I seek my master, and my master seeks
SPEED:
not me: therefore I am no sheep.
PROTEUS:
The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the
PROTEUS:
shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
PROTEUS:
wages followest thy master, thy master for wages
PROTEUS:
follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
SPEED:
Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
PROTEUS:
But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?
SPEED:
Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
SPEED:
a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
SPEED:
lost mutton, nothing for my labour.
PROTEUS:
Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
SPEED:
If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
PROTEUS:
Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.
SPEED:
Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
SPEED:
carrying your letter.
PROTEUS:
You mistake, I mean the pound,--a pinfold.
SPEED:
From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
SPEED:
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
SPEED:
your lover.
PROTEUS:
But what said she?
SPEED:
[First nodding]  Ay.
PROTEUS:
Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.
SPEED:
You mistook, sir, I say, she did nod: and you ask
SPEED:
me if she did nod, and I say, 'Ay.'
PROTEUS:
And that set together is noddy.
SPEED:
Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
SPEED:
take it for your pains.
PROTEUS:
No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.
SPEED:
Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
PROTEUS:
Why sir, how do you bear with me?
SPEED:
Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing
SPEED:
but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
PROTEUS:
Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
SPEED:
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
PROTEUS:
Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
SPEED:
Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
SPEED:
be both at once delivered.
PROTEUS:
Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
SPEED:
Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
PROTEUS:
Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
SPEED:
Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her, no,
SPEED:
not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter
SPEED:
and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
SPEED:
fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
SPEED:
mind. Give her no token but stones, for she's as
SPEED:
hard as steel.
PROTEUS:
What said she? nothing?
SPEED:
No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
SPEED:
testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
SPEED:
me, in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
SPEED:
letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.
PROTEUS:
Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
PROTEUS:
Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
PROTEUS:
Being destined to a drier death on shore.
PROTEUS:
Exit SPEED
PROTEUS:
I must go send some better messenger
PROTEUS:
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
PROTEUS:
Receiving them from such a worthless post.
PROTEUS:
Exit
PROTEUS:
SCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house.
PROTEUS:
Enter JULlA and LUCETTA
JULIA:
But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
JULIA:
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
LUCETTA:
Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
JULIA:
Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
JULIA:
That every day with parle encounter me,
JULIA:
In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
LUCETTA:
Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
LUCETTA:
According to my shallow simple skill.
JULIA:
What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
LUCETTA:
As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine,
LUCETTA:
But, were I you, he never should be mine.
JULIA:
What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
LUCETTA:
Well of his wealth, but of himself, so so.
JULIA:
What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
LUCETTA:
Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
JULIA:
How now! what means this passion at his name?
LUCETTA:
Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
LUCETTA:
That I, unworthy body as I am,
LUCETTA:
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
JULIA:
Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
LUCETTA:
Then thus: of many good I think him best.
JULIA:
Your reason?
LUCETTA:
I have no other, but a woman's reason,
LUCETTA:
I think him so because I think him so.
JULIA:
And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
LUCETTA:
Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
JULIA:
Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.
LUCETTA:
Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
JULIA:
His little speaking shows his love but small.
LUCETTA:
Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
JULIA:
They do not love that do not show their love.
LUCETTA:
O, they love least that let men know their love.
JULIA:
I would I knew his mind.
LUCETTA:
Peruse this paper, madam.
JULIA:
'To Julia.' Say, from whom?
LUCETTA:
That the contents will show.
JULIA:
Say, say, who gave it thee?
LUCETTA:
Valentine's page, and sent, I think, from Proteus.
LUCETTA:
He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,
LUCETTA:
Did in your name receive it: pardon the
LUCETTA:
fault I pray.
JULIA:
Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
JULIA:
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
JULIA:
To whisper and conspire against my youth?
JULIA:
Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
JULIA:
And you an officer fit for the place.
JULIA:
Or else return no more into my sight.
LUCETTA:
To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
JULIA:
Will ye be gone?
LUCETTA:
That you may ruminate.
LUCETTA:
Exit
JULIA:
And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter
JULIA:
It were a shame to call her back again
JULIA:
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
JULIA:
What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
JULIA:
And would not force the letter to my view!
JULIA:
Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
JULIA:
Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
JULIA:
Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
JULIA:
That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
JULIA:
And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
JULIA:
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
JULIA:
When willingly I would have had her here!
JULIA:
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
JULIA:
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
JULIA:
My penance is to call Lucetta back
JULIA:
And ask remission for my folly past.
JULIA:
What ho! Lucetta!
JULIA:
Re-enter LUCETTA
LUCETTA:
What would your ladyship?
JULIA:
Is't near dinner-time?
LUCETTA:
I would it were,
LUCETTA:
That you might kill your stomach on your meat
LUCETTA:
And not upon your maid.
JULIA:
What is't that you took up so gingerly?
LUCETTA:
Nothing.
JULIA:
Why didst thou stoop, then?
LUCETTA:
To take a paper up that I let fall.
JULIA:
And is that paper nothing?
LUCETTA:
Nothing concerning me.
JULIA:
Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
LUCETTA:
Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
LUCETTA:
Unless it have a false interpeter.
JULIA:
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
LUCETTA:
That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
LUCETTA:
Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
JULIA:
As little by such toys as may be possible.
JULIA:
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
LUCETTA:
It is too heavy for so light a tune.
JULIA:
Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
LUCETTA:
Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
JULIA:
And why not you?
LUCETTA:
I cannot reach so high.
JULIA:
Let's see your song. How now, minion!
LUCETTA:
Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out
LUCETTA:
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
JULIA:
You do not?
LUCETTA:
No, madam, it is too sharp.
JULIA:
You, minion, are too saucy.
LUCETTA:
Nay, now you are too flat
LUCETTA:
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant
LUCETTA:
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
JULIA:
The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
LUCETTA:
Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
JULIA:
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
JULIA:
Here is a coil with protestation!
JULIA:
Tears the letter
JULIA:
Go get you gone, and let the papers lie
JULIA:
You would be fingering them, to anger me.
LUCETTA:
She makes it strange, but she would be best pleased
LUCETTA:
To be so anger'd with another letter.
LUCETTA:
Exit
JULIA:
Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
JULIA:
O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
JULIA:
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
JULIA:
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
JULIA:
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
JULIA:
Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
JULIA:
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
JULIA:
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
JULIA:
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
JULIA:
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
JULIA:
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
JULIA:
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd,
JULIA:
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
JULIA:
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
JULIA:
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
JULIA:
Till I have found each letter in the letter,
JULIA:
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
JULIA:
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
JULIA:
And throw it thence into the raging sea!
JULIA:
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
JULIA:
'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
JULIA:
To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
JULIA:
And yet I will not, sith so prettily
JULIA:
He couples it to his complaining names.
JULIA:
Thus will I fold them one on another
JULIA:
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
JULIA:
Re-enter LUCETTA
LUCETTA:
Madam,
LUCETTA:
Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
JULIA:
Well, let us go.
LUCETTA:
What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
JULIA:
If you respect them, best to take them up.
LUCETTA:
Nay, I was taken up for laying them down
LUCETTA:
Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
JULIA:
I see you have a month's mind to them.
LUCETTA:
Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see,
LUCETTA:
I see things too, although you judge I wink.
JULIA:
Come, come, will't please you go?
JULIA:
Exeunt
JULIA:
SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.
JULIA:
Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO
ANTONIO:
Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
ANTONIO:
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
PANTHINO:
'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
ANTONIO:
Why, what of him?
PANTHINO:
He wonder'd that your lordship
PANTHINO:
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
PANTHINO:
While other men, of slender reputation,
PANTHINO:
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out
PANTHINO:
Some to the wars, to try their fortune there,
PANTHINO:
Some to discover islands far away,
PANTHINO:
Some to the studious universities.
PANTHINO:
For any or for all these exercises,
PANTHINO:
He said that Proteus your son was meet,
PANTHINO:
And did request me to importune you
PANTHINO:
To let him spend his time no more at home,
PANTHINO:
Which would be great impeachment to his age,
PANTHINO:
In having known no travel in his youth.
ANTONIO:
Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
ANTONIO:
Whereon this month I have been hammering.
ANTONIO:
I have consider'd well his loss of time
ANTONIO:
And how he cannot be a perfect man,
ANTONIO:
Not being tried and tutor'd in the world
ANTONIO:
Experience is by industry achieved
ANTONIO:
And perfected by the swift course of time.
ANTONIO:
Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?
PANTHINO:
I think your lordship is not ignorant
PANTHINO:
How his companion, youthful Valentine,
PANTHINO:
Attends the emperor in his royal court.
ANTONIO:
I know it well.
PANTHINO:
'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither
PANTHINO:
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
PANTHINO:
Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.
PANTHINO:
And be in eye of every exercise
PANTHINO:
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
ANTONIO:
I like thy counsel, well hast thou advised
ANTONIO:
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
ANTONIO:
The execution of it shall make known.
ANTONIO:
Even with the speediest expedition
ANTONIO:
I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
PANTHINO:
To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
PANTHINO:
With other gentlemen of good esteem,
PANTHINO:
Are journeying to salute the emperor
PANTHINO:
And to commend their service to his will.
ANTONIO:
Good company, with them shall Proteus go
ANTONIO:
And, in good time! now will we break with him.
ANTONIO:
Enter PROTEUS
PROTEUS:
Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
PROTEUS:
Here is her hand, the agent of her heart,
PROTEUS:
Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
PROTEUS:
O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
PROTEUS:
To seal our happiness with their consents!
PROTEUS:
O heavenly Julia!
ANTONIO:
How now! what letter are you reading there?
PROTEUS:
May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
PROTEUS:
Of commendations sent from Valentine,
PROTEUS:
Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
ANTONIO:
Lend me the letter, let me see what news.
PROTEUS:
There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
PROTEUS:
How happily he lives, how well beloved
PROTEUS:
And daily graced by the emperor,
PROTEUS:
Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
ANTONIO:
And how stand you affected to his wish?
PROTEUS:
As one relying on your lordship's will
PROTEUS:
And not depending on his friendly wish.
ANTONIO:
My will is something sorted with his wish.
ANTONIO:
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed,
ANTONIO:
For what I will, I will, and there an end.
ANTONIO:
I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
ANTONIO:
With Valentinus in the emperor's court
ANTONIO:
What maintenance he from his friends receives,
ANTONIO:
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
ANTONIO:
To-morrow be in readiness to go
ANTONIO:
Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
PROTEUS:
My lord, I cannot be so soon provided
PROTEUS:
Please you, deliberate a day or two.
ANTONIO:
Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee
ANTONIO:
No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
ANTONIO:
Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
ANTONIO:
To hasten on his expedition.
ANTONIO:
Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO
PROTEUS:
Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
PROTEUS:
And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
PROTEUS:
I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
PROTEUS:
Lest he should take exceptions to my love,
PROTEUS:
And with the vantage of mine own excuse
PROTEUS:
Hath he excepted most against my love.
PROTEUS:
O, how this spring of love resembleth
PROTEUS:
The uncertain glory of an April day,
PROTEUS:
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
PROTEUS:
And by and by a cloud takes all away!
PROTEUS:
Re-enter PANTHINO
PANTHINO:
Sir Proteus, your father calls for you
PANTHINO:
He is in haste, therefore, I pray you to go.
PROTEUS:
Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
PROTEUS:
And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'
PROTEUS:
Exeunt
PROTEUS:
ACT II
PROTEUS:
SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.
PROTEUS:
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
SPEED:
Sir, your glove.
VALENTINE:
Not mine, my gloves are on.
SPEED:
Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
VALENTINE:
Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine
VALENTINE:
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
VALENTINE:
Ah, Silvia, Silvia!
SPEED:
Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
VALENTINE:
How now, sirrah?
SPEED:
She is not within hearing, sir.
VALENTINE:
Why, sir, who bade you call her?
SPEED:
Your worship, sir, or else I mistook.
VALENTINE:
Well, you'll still be too forward.
SPEED:
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
VALENTINE:
Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
SPEED:
She that your worship loves?
VALENTINE:
Why, how know you that I am in love?
SPEED:
Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
SPEED:
learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
SPEED:
like a malecontent, to relish a love-song, like a
SPEED:
robin-redbreast, to walk alone, like one that had
SPEED:
the pestilence, to sigh, like a school-boy that had
SPEED:
lost his A B C, to weep, like a young wench that had
SPEED:
buried her grandam, to fast, like one that takes
SPEED:
diet, to watch like one that fears robbing, to
SPEED:
speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
SPEED:
wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock, when you
SPEED:
walked, to walk like one of the lions, when you
SPEED:
fasted, it was presently after dinner, when you
SPEED:
looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
SPEED:
are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
SPEED:
on you, I can hardly think you my master.
VALENTINE:
Are all these things perceived in me?
SPEED:
They are all perceived without ye.
VALENTINE:
Without me? they cannot.
SPEED:
Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
SPEED:
were so simple, none else would: but you are so
SPEED:
without these follies, that these follies are within
SPEED:
you and shine through you like the water in an
SPEED:
urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
SPEED:
physician to comment on your malady.
VALENTINE:
But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
SPEED:
She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
VALENTINE:
Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
SPEED:
Why, sir, I know her not.
VALENTINE:
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
VALENTINE:
knowest her not?
SPEED:
Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
VALENTINE:
Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
SPEED:
Sir, I know that well enough.
VALENTINE:
What dost thou know?
SPEED:
That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.
VALENTINE:
I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
SPEED:
That's because the one is painted and the other out
SPEED:
of all count.
VALENTINE:
How painted? and how out of count?
SPEED:
Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
SPEED:
man counts of her beauty.
VALENTINE:
How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
SPEED:
You never saw her since she was deformed.
VALENTINE:
How long hath she been deformed?
SPEED:
Ever since you loved her.
VALENTINE:
I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I
VALENTINE:
see her beautiful.
SPEED:
If you love her, you cannot see her.
VALENTINE:
Why?
SPEED:
Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes,
SPEED:
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
SPEED:
have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
SPEED:
ungartered!
VALENTINE:
What should I see then?
SPEED:
Your own present folly and her passing deformity
SPEED:
for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
SPEED:
hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
VALENTINE:
Belike, boy, then, you are in love, for last
VALENTINE:
morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
SPEED:
True, sir, I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
SPEED:
you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
SPEED:
bolder to chide you for yours.
VALENTINE:
In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
SPEED:
I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
VALENTINE:
Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
VALENTINE:
one she loves.
SPEED:
And have you?
VALENTINE:
I have.
SPEED:
Are they not lamely writ?
VALENTINE:
No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
VALENTINE:
here she comes.
SPEED:
[Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
SPEED:
Now will he interpret to her.
SPEED:
Enter SILVIA
VALENTINE:
Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.
SPEED:
[Aside]  O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.
SILVIA:
Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
SPEED:
[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.
VALENTINE:
As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
VALENTINE:
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours,
VALENTINE:
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
VALENTINE:
But for my duty to your ladyship.
SILVIA:
I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
VALENTINE:
Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off,
VALENTINE:
For being ignorant to whom it goes
VALENTINE:
I writ at random, very doubtfully.
SILVIA:
Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
VALENTINE:
No, madam, so it stead you, I will write
VALENTINE:
Please you command, a thousand times as much, And yet--
SILVIA:
A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel,
SILVIA:
And yet I will not name it, and yet I care not,
SILVIA:
And yet take this again, and yet I thank you,
SILVIA:
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
SPEED:
[Aside]  And yet you will, and yet another 'yet.'
VALENTINE:
What means your ladyship? do you not like it?
SILVIA:
Yes, yes, the lines are very quaintly writ,
SILVIA:
But since unwillingly, take them again.
SILVIA:
Nay, take them.
VALENTINE:
Madam, they are for you.
SILVIA:
Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request,
SILVIA:
But I will none of them, they are for you,
SILVIA:
I would have had them writ more movingly.
VALENTINE:
Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
SILVIA:
And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
SILVIA:
And if it please you, so, if not, why, so.
VALENTINE:
If it please me, madam, what then?
SILVIA:
Why, if it please you, take it for your labour
SILVIA:
And so, good morrow, servant.
SILVIA:
Exit
SPEED:
O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
SPEED:
As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!
SPEED:
My master sues to her, and she hath
SPEED:
taught her suitor,
SPEED:
He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
SPEED:
O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
SPEED:
That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
SPEED:
the letter?
VALENTINE:
How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?
SPEED:
Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
VALENTINE:
To do what?
SPEED:
To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
VALENTINE:
To whom?
SPEED:
To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.
VALENTINE:
What figure?
SPEED:
By a letter, I should say.
VALENTINE:
Why, she hath not writ to me?
SPEED:
What need she, when she hath made you write to
SPEED:
yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
VALENTINE:
No, believe me.
SPEED:
No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
SPEED:
her earnest?
VALENTINE:
She gave me none, except an angry word.
SPEED:
Why, she hath given you a letter.
VALENTINE:
That's the letter I writ to her friend.
SPEED:
And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.
VALENTINE:
I would it were no worse.
SPEED:
I'll warrant you, 'tis as well
SPEED:
For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
SPEED:
Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply,
SPEED:
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
SPEED:
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
SPEED:
All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
SPEED:
Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.
VALENTINE:
I have dined.
SPEED:
Ay, but hearken, sir, though the chameleon Love can
SPEED:
feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my
SPEED:
victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like
SPEED:
your mistress, be moved, be moved.
SPEED:
Exeunt
SPEED:
SCENE II. Verona. JULIA'S house.
SPEED:
Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
PROTEUS:
Have patience, gentle Julia.
JULIA:
I must, where is no remedy.
PROTEUS:
When possibly I can, I will return.
JULIA:
If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
JULIA:
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
JULIA:
Giving a ring
PROTEUS:
Why then, we'll make exchange, here, take you this.
JULIA:
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
PROTEUS:
Here is my hand for my true constancy,
PROTEUS:
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
PROTEUS:
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
PROTEUS:
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
PROTEUS:
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
PROTEUS:
My father stays my coming, answer not,
PROTEUS:
The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears,
PROTEUS:
That tide will stay me longer than I should.
PROTEUS:
Julia, farewell!
PROTEUS:
Exit JULIA
PROTEUS:
What, gone without a word?
PROTEUS:
Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak,
PROTEUS:
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
PROTEUS:
Enter PANTHINO
PANTHINO:
Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.
PROTEUS:
Go, I come, I come.
PROTEUS:
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
PROTEUS:
Exeunt
PROTEUS:
SCENE III. The same. A street.
PROTEUS:
Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog
LAUNCE:
Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping,
LAUNCE:
all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
LAUNCE:
have received my proportion, like the prodigious
LAUNCE:
son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's
LAUNCE:
court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured
LAUNCE:
dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
LAUNCE:
wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
LAUNCE:
wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
LAUNCE:
perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
LAUNCE:
one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
LAUNCE:
has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
LAUNCE:
wept to have seen our parting, why, my grandam,
LAUNCE:
having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my
LAUNCE:
parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This
LAUNCE:
shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father
LAUNCE:
no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
LAUNCE:
cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
LAUNCE:
hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
LAUNCE:
it, is my mother, and this my father, a vengeance
LAUNCE:
on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my
LAUNCE:
sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
LAUNCE:
as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
LAUNCE:
am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
LAUNCE:
dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself, ay, so,
LAUNCE:
so. Now come I to my father, Father, your blessing
LAUNCE:
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping
LAUNCE:
now should I kiss my father, well, he weeps on. Now
LAUNCE:
come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
LAUNCE:
like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her, why, there
LAUNCE:
'tis, here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
LAUNCE:
come I to my sister, mark the moan she makes. Now
LAUNCE:
the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
LAUNCE:
word, but see how I lay the dust with my tears.
LAUNCE:
Enter PANTHINO
PANTHINO:
Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped
PANTHINO:
and thou art to post after with oars. What's the
PANTHINO:
matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll
PANTHINO:
lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.
LAUNCE:
It is no matter if the tied were lost, for it is the
LAUNCE:
unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
PANTHINO:
What's the unkindest tide?
LAUNCE:
Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.
PANTHINO:
Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in
PANTHINO:
losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
PANTHINO:
thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
PANTHINO:
master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
PANTHINO:
service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?
LAUNCE:
For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
PANTHINO:
Where should I lose my tongue?
LAUNCE:
In thy tale.
PANTHINO:
In thy tail!
LAUNCE:
Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and
LAUNCE:
the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river
LAUNCE:
were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears, if the
LAUNCE:
wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.
PANTHINO:
Come, come away, man, I was sent to call thee.
LAUNCE:
Sir, call me what thou darest.
PANTHINO:
Wilt thou go?
LAUNCE:
Well, I will go.
LAUNCE:
Exeunt
LAUNCE:
SCENE IV. Milan. The DUKE's palace.
LAUNCE:
Enter SILVIA, VALENTINE, THURIO, and SPEED
SILVIA:
Servant!
VALENTINE:
Mistress?
SPEED:
Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.
VALENTINE:
Ay, boy, it's for love.
SPEED:
Not of you.
VALENTINE:
Of my mistress, then.
SPEED:
'Twere good you knocked him.
SPEED:
Exit
SILVIA:
Servant, you are sad.
VALENTINE:
Indeed, madam, I seem so.
THURIO:
Seem you that you are not?
VALENTINE:
Haply I do.
THURIO:
So do counterfeits.
VALENTINE:
So do you.
THURIO:
What seem I that I am not?
VALENTINE:
Wise.
THURIO:
What instance of the contrary?
VALENTINE:
Your folly.
THURIO:
And how quote you my folly?
VALENTINE:
I quote it in your jerkin.
THURIO:
My jerkin is a doublet.
VALENTINE:
Well, then, I'll double your folly.
THURIO:
How?
SILVIA:
What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?
VALENTINE:
Give him leave, madam, he is a kind of chameleon.
THURIO:
That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
THURIO:
in your air.
VALENTINE:
You have said, sir.
THURIO:
Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
VALENTINE:
I know it well, sir, you always end ere you begin.
SILVIA:
A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
VALENTINE:
'Tis indeed, madam, we thank the giver.
SILVIA:
Who is that, servant?
VALENTINE:
Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire. Sir
VALENTINE:
Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,
VALENTINE:
and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
THURIO:
Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall
THURIO:
make your wit bankrupt.
VALENTINE:
I know it well, sir, you have an exchequer of words,
VALENTINE:
and, I think, no other treasure to give your
VALENTINE:
followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,
VALENTINE:
that they live by your bare words.
SILVIA:
No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.
SILVIA:
Enter DUKE
DUKE:
Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
DUKE:
Sir Valentine, your father's in good health
DUKE:
What say you to a letter from your friends
DUKE:
Of much good news?
VALENTINE:
My lord, I will be thankful.
VALENTINE:
To any happy messenger from thence.
DUKE:
Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
VALENTINE:
Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
VALENTINE:
To be of worth and worthy estimation
VALENTINE:
And not without desert so well reputed.
DUKE:
Hath he not a son?
VALENTINE:
Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves
VALENTINE:
The honour and regard of such a father.
DUKE:
You know him well?
VALENTINE:
I know him as myself, for from our infancy
VALENTINE:
We have conversed and spent our hours together
VALENTINE:
And though myself have been an idle truant,
VALENTINE:
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
VALENTINE:
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
VALENTINE:
Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
VALENTINE:
Made use and fair advantage of his days,
VALENTINE:
His years but young, but his experience old,
VALENTINE:
His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe,
VALENTINE:
And, in a word, for far behind his worth
VALENTINE:
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
VALENTINE:
He is complete in feature and in mind
VALENTINE:
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
DUKE:
Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
DUKE:
He is as worthy for an empress' love
DUKE:
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
DUKE:
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
DUKE:
With commendation from great potentates,
DUKE:
And here he means to spend his time awhile
DUKE:
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
VALENTINE:
Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
DUKE:
Welcome him then according to his worth.
DUKE:
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio,
DUKE:
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it
DUKE:
I will send him hither to you presently.
DUKE:
Exit
VALENTINE:
This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
VALENTINE:
Had come along with me, but that his mistress
VALENTINE:
Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
SILVIA:
Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
SILVIA:
Upon some other pawn for fealty.
VALENTINE:
Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
SILVIA:
Nay, then he should be blind, and, being blind
SILVIA:
How could he see his way to seek out you?
VALENTINE:
Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
THURIO:
They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
VALENTINE:
To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself
VALENTINE:
Upon a homely object Love can wink.
SILVIA:
Have done, have done, here comes the gentleman.
SILVIA:
Exit THURIO
SILVIA:
Enter PROTEUS
VALENTINE:
Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,
VALENTINE:
Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
SILVIA:
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
SILVIA:
If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
VALENTINE:
Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
VALENTINE:
To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
SILVIA:
Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
PROTEUS:
Not so, sweet  lady: but too mean a servant
PROTEUS:
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
VALENTINE:
Leave off discourse of disability
VALENTINE:
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
PROTEUS:
My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
SILVIA:
And duty never yet did want his meed
SILVIA:
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
PROTEUS:
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
SILVIA:
That you are welcome?
PROTEUS:
That you are worthless.
PROTEUS:
Re-enter THURIO
THURIO:
Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
SILVIA:
I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
SILVIA:
Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome
SILVIA:
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs,
SILVIA:
When you have done, we look to hear from you.
PROTEUS:
We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
PROTEUS:
Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO
VALENTINE:
Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
PROTEUS:
Your friends are well and have them much commended.
VALENTINE:
And how do yours?
PROTEUS:
I left them all in health.
VALENTINE:
How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
PROTEUS:
My tales of love were wont to weary you,
PROTEUS:
I know you joy not in a love discourse.
VALENTINE:
Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now
VALENTINE:
I have done penance for contemning Love,
VALENTINE:
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
VALENTINE:
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
VALENTINE:
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs,
VALENTINE:
For in revenge of my contempt of love,
VALENTINE:
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
VALENTINE:
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
VALENTINE:
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
VALENTINE:
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
VALENTINE:
There is no woe to his correction,
VALENTINE:
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
VALENTINE:
Now no discourse, except it be of love,
VALENTINE:
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
VALENTINE:
Upon the very naked name of love.
PROTEUS:
Enough, I read your fortune in your eye.
PROTEUS:
Was this the idol that you worship so?
VALENTINE:
Even she, and is she not a heavenly saint?
PROTEUS:
No, but she is an earthly paragon.
VALENTINE:
Call her divine.
PROTEUS:
I will not flatter her.
VALENTINE:
O, flatter me, for love delights in praises.
PROTEUS:
When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
PROTEUS:
And I must minister the like to you.
VALENTINE:
Then speak the truth by her, if not divine,
VALENTINE:
Yet let her be a principality,
VALENTINE:
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
PROTEUS:
Except my mistress.
VALENTINE:
Sweet, except not any,
VALENTINE:
Except thou wilt except against my love.
PROTEUS:
Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
VALENTINE:
And I will help thee to prefer her too
VALENTINE:
She shall be dignified with this high honour--
VALENTINE:
To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
VALENTINE:
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
VALENTINE:
And, of so great a favour growing proud,
VALENTINE:
Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
VALENTINE:
And make rough winter everlastingly.
PROTEUS:
Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
VALENTINE:
Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
VALENTINE:
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing,
VALENTINE:
She is alone.
PROTEUS:
Then let her alone.
VALENTINE:
Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
VALENTINE:
And I as rich in having such a jewel
VALENTINE:
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
VALENTINE:
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
VALENTINE:
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
VALENTINE:
Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
VALENTINE:
My foolish rival, that her father likes
VALENTINE:
Only for his possessions are so huge,
VALENTINE:
Is gone with her along, and I must after,
VALENTINE:
For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
PROTEUS:
But she loves you?
VALENTINE:
Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
VALENTINE:
marriage-hour,
VALENTINE:
With all the cunning manner of our flight,
VALENTINE:
Determined of, how I must climb her window,
VALENTINE:
The ladder made of cords, and all the means
VALENTINE:
Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
VALENTINE:
Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
VALENTINE:
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
PROTEUS:
Go on before, I shall inquire you forth
PROTEUS:
I must unto the road, to disembark
PROTEUS:
Some necessaries that I needs must use,
PROTEUS:
And then I'll presently attend you.
VALENTINE:
Will you make haste?
PROTEUS:
I will.
PROTEUS:
Exit VALENTINE
PROTEUS:
Even as one heat another heat expels,
PROTEUS:
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
PROTEUS:
So the remembrance of my former love
PROTEUS:
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
PROTEUS:
Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
PROTEUS:
Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
PROTEUS:
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
PROTEUS:
She is fair, and so is Julia that I love--
PROTEUS:
That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd,
PROTEUS:
Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
PROTEUS:
Bears no impression of the thing it was.
PROTEUS:
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
PROTEUS:
And that I love him not as I was wont.
PROTEUS:
O, but I love his lady too too much,
PROTEUS:
And that's the reason I love him so little.
PROTEUS:
How shall I dote on her with more advice,
PROTEUS:
That thus without advice begin to love her!
PROTEUS:
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
PROTEUS:
And that hath dazzled my reason's light,
PROTEUS:
But when I look on her perfections,
PROTEUS:
There is no reason but I shall be blind.
PROTEUS:
If I can cheque my erring love, I will,
PROTEUS:
If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.
PROTEUS:
Exit
PROTEUS:
SCENE V. The same. A street.
PROTEUS:
Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally
SPEED:
Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!
LAUNCE:
Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not
LAUNCE:
welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never
LAUNCE:
undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a
LAUNCE:
place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
LAUNCE:
say 'Welcome!'
SPEED:
Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you
SPEED:
presently, where, for one shot of five pence, thou
SPEED:
shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how
SPEED:
did thy master part with Madam Julia?
LAUNCE:
Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very
LAUNCE:
fairly in jest.
SPEED:
But shall she marry him?
LAUNCE:
No.
SPEED:
How then? shall he marry her?
LAUNCE:
No, neither.
SPEED:
What, are they broken?
LAUNCE:
No, they are both as whole as a fish.
SPEED:
Why, then, how stands the matter with them?
LAUNCE:
Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it
LAUNCE:
stands well with her.
SPEED:
What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
LAUNCE:
What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My
LAUNCE:
staff understands me.
SPEED:
What thou sayest?
LAUNCE:
Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,
LAUNCE:
and my staff understands me.
SPEED:
It stands under thee, indeed.
LAUNCE:
Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
SPEED:
But tell me true, will't be a match?
LAUNCE:
Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,
LAUNCE:
it will, if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.
SPEED:
The conclusion is then that it will.
LAUNCE:
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
SPEED:
'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest
SPEED:
thou, that my master is become a notable lover?
LAUNCE:
I never knew him otherwise.
SPEED:
Than how?
LAUNCE:
A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
SPEED:
Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.
LAUNCE:
Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master.
SPEED:
I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
LAUNCE:
Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself
LAUNCE:
in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse,
LAUNCE:
if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the
LAUNCE:
name of a Christian.
SPEED:
Why?
LAUNCE:
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
LAUNCE:
go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
SPEED:
At thy service.
SPEED:
Exeunt
SPEED:
SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.
SPEED:
Enter PROTEUS
PROTEUS:
To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn,
PROTEUS:
To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn,
PROTEUS:
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn,
PROTEUS:
And even that power which gave me first my oath
PROTEUS:
Provokes me to this threefold perjury,
PROTEUS:
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
PROTEUS:
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
PROTEUS:
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
PROTEUS:
At first I did adore a twinkling star,
PROTEUS:
But now I worship a celestial sun.
PROTEUS:
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
PROTEUS:
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
PROTEUS:
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
PROTEUS:
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
PROTEUS:
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
PROTEUS:
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
PROTEUS:
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do,
PROTEUS:
But there I leave to love where I should love.
PROTEUS:
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose
PROTEUS:
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself,
PROTEUS:
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
PROTEUS:
For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
PROTEUS:
I to myself am dearer than a friend,
PROTEUS:
For love is still most precious in itself,
PROTEUS:
And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
PROTEUS:
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
PROTEUS:
I will forget that Julia is alive,
PROTEUS:
Remembering that my love to her is dead,
PROTEUS:
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
PROTEUS:
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
PROTEUS:
I cannot now prove constant to myself,
PROTEUS:
Without some treachery used to Valentine.
PROTEUS:
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
PROTEUS:
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
PROTEUS:
Myself in counsel, his competitor.
PROTEUS:
Now presently I'll give her father notice
PROTEUS:
Of their disguising and pretended flight,
PROTEUS:
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine,
PROTEUS:
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter,
PROTEUS:
But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
PROTEUS:
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
PROTEUS:
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
PROTEUS:
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!

PROTEUS:
SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.
PROTEUS:
Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
JULIA:
Counsel, Lucetta, gentle girl, assist me,
JULIA:
And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
JULIA:
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
JULIA:
Are visibly character'd and engraved,
JULIA:
To lesson me and tell me some good mean
JULIA:
How, with my honour, I may undertake
JULIA:
A journey to my loving Proteus.
LUCETTA:
Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
JULIA:
A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
JULIA:
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps,
JULIA:
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
JULIA:
And when the flight is made to one so dear,
JULIA:
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
LUCETTA:
Better forbear till Proteus make return.
JULIA:
O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
JULIA:
Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
JULIA:
By longing for that food so long a time.
JULIA:
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
JULIA:
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
JULIA:
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
LUCETTA:
I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
LUCETTA:
But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
LUCETTA:
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
JULIA:
The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
JULIA:
The current that with gentle murmur glides,
JULIA:
Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage,
JULIA:
But when his fair course is not hindered,
JULIA:
He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,
JULIA:
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
JULIA:
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
JULIA:
And so by many winding nooks he strays
JULIA:
With willing sport to the wild ocean.
JULIA:
Then let me go and hinder not my course
JULIA:
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
JULIA:
And make a pastime of each weary step,
JULIA:
Till the last step have brought me to my love,
JULIA:
And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
JULIA:
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
LUCETTA:
But in what habit will you go along?
JULIA:
Not like a woman, for I would prevent
JULIA:
The loose encounters of lascivious men
JULIA:
Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
JULIA:
As may beseem some well-reputed page.
LUCETTA:
Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
JULIA:
No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
JULIA:
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
JULIA:
To be fantastic may become a youth
JULIA:
Of greater time than I shall show to be.
LUCETTA:
What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?
JULIA:
That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
JULIA:
What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
JULIA:
Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.
LUCETTA:
You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
JULIA:
Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.
LUCETTA:
A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
LUCETTA:
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
JULIA:
Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
JULIA:
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
JULIA:
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
JULIA:
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
JULIA:
I fear me, it will make me scandalized.
LUCETTA:
If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
JULIA:
Nay, that I will not.
LUCETTA:
Then never dream on infamy, but go.
LUCETTA:
If Proteus like your journey when you come,
LUCETTA:
No matter who's displeased when you are gone
LUCETTA:
I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.
JULIA:
That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear
JULIA:
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
JULIA:
And instances of infinite of love
JULIA:
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
LUCETTA:
All these are servants to deceitful men.
JULIA:
Base men, that use them to so base effect!
JULIA:
But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
JULIA:
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
JULIA:
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
JULIA:
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
JULIA:
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
LUCETTA:
Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!
JULIA:
Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
JULIA:
To bear a hard opinion of his truth
JULIA:
Only deserve my love by loving him,
JULIA:
And presently go with me to my chamber,
JULIA:
To take a note of what I stand in need of,
JULIA:
To furnish me upon my longing journey.
JULIA:
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
JULIA:
My goods, my lands, my reputation,
JULIA:
Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
JULIA:
Come, answer not, but to it presently!
JULIA:
I am impatient of my tarriance.
JULIA:
Exeunt
JULIA:
ACT III
JULIA:
SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.
JULIA:
Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS
DUKE:
Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile,
DUKE:
We have some secrets to confer about.
DUKE:
Exit THURIO
DUKE:
Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
PROTEUS:
My gracious lord, that which I would discover
PROTEUS:
The law of friendship bids me to conceal,
PROTEUS:
But when I call to mind your gracious favours
PROTEUS:
Done to me, undeserving as I am,
PROTEUS:
My duty pricks me on to utter that
PROTEUS:
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
PROTEUS:
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
PROTEUS:
This night intends to steal away your daughter
PROTEUS:
Myself am one made privy to the plot.
PROTEUS:
I know you have determined to bestow her
PROTEUS:
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,
PROTEUS:
And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
PROTEUS:
It would be much vexation to your age.
PROTEUS:
Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
PROTEUS:
To cross my friend in his intended drift
PROTEUS:
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
PROTEUS:
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
PROTEUS:
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
DUKE:
Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,
DUKE:
Which to requite, command me while I live.
DUKE:
This love of theirs myself have often seen,
DUKE:
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
DUKE:
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
DUKE:
Sir Valentine her company and my court
DUKE:
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
DUKE:
And so unworthily disgrace the man,
DUKE:
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
DUKE:
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
DUKE:
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
DUKE:
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
DUKE:
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
DUKE:
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
DUKE:
The key whereof myself have ever kept,
DUKE:
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
PROTEUS:
Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
PROTEUS:
How he her chamber-window will ascend
PROTEUS:
And with a corded ladder fetch her down,
PROTEUS:
For which the youthful lover now is gone
PROTEUS:
And this way comes he with it presently,
PROTEUS:
Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
PROTEUS:
But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly
PROTEUS:
That my discovery be not aimed at,
PROTEUS:
For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
PROTEUS:
Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
DUKE:
Upon mine honour, he shall never know
DUKE:
That I had any light from thee of this.
PROTEUS:
Adieu, my Lord, Sir Valentine is coming.
PROTEUS:
Exit
PROTEUS:
Enter VALENTINE
DUKE:
Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
VALENTINE:
Please it your grace, there is a messenger
VALENTINE:
That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
VALENTINE:
And I am going to deliver them.
DUKE:
Be they of much import?
VALENTINE:
The tenor of them doth but signify
VALENTINE:
My health and happy being at your court.
DUKE:
Nay then, no matter, stay with me awhile,
DUKE:
I am to break with thee of some affairs
DUKE:
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
DUKE:
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
DUKE:
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
VALENTINE:
I know it well, my Lord, and, sure, the match
VALENTINE:
Were rich and honourable, besides, the gentleman
VALENTINE:
Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
VALENTINE:
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
VALENTINE:
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
DUKE:
No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,
DUKE:
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
DUKE:
Neither regarding that she is my child
DUKE:
Nor fearing me as if I were her father,
DUKE:
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
DUKE:
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her,
DUKE:
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
DUKE:
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
DUKE:
I now am full resolved to take a wife
DUKE:
And turn her out to who will take her in
DUKE:
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower,
DUKE:
For me and my possessions she esteems not.
VALENTINE:
What would your Grace have me to do in this?
DUKE:
There is a lady in Verona here
DUKE:
Whom I affect, but she is nice and coy
DUKE:
And nought esteems my aged eloquence
DUKE:
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
DUKE:
For long agone I have forgot to court,
DUKE:
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
DUKE:
How and which way I may bestow myself
DUKE:
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
VALENTINE:
Win her with gifts, if she respect not words
VALENTINE:
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
VALENTINE:
More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
DUKE:
But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
VALENTINE:
A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
VALENTINE:
Send her another, never give her o'er,
VALENTINE:
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
VALENTINE:
If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
VALENTINE:
But rather to beget more love in you
VALENTINE:
If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone,
VALENTINE:
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
VALENTINE:
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say,
VALENTINE:
For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
VALENTINE:
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces,
VALENTINE:
Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
VALENTINE:
That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
VALENTINE:
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
DUKE:
But she I mean is promised by her friends
DUKE:
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
DUKE:
And kept severely from resort of men,
DUKE:
That no man hath access by day to her.
VALENTINE:
Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
DUKE:
Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
DUKE:
That no man hath recourse to her by night.
VALENTINE:
What lets but one may enter at her window?
DUKE:
Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
DUKE:
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
DUKE:
Without apparent hazard of his life.
VALENTINE:
Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
VALENTINE:
To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
VALENTINE:
Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
VALENTINE:
So bold Leander would adventure it.
DUKE:
Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
DUKE:
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
VALENTINE:
When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
DUKE:
This very night, for Love is like a child,
DUKE:
That longs for every thing that he can come by.
VALENTINE:
By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
DUKE:
But, hark thee, I will go to her alone
DUKE:
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
VALENTINE:
It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
VALENTINE:
Under a cloak that is of any length.
DUKE:
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
VALENTINE:
Ay, my good lord.
DUKE:
Then let me see thy cloak
DUKE:
I'll get me one of such another length.
VALENTINE:
Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
DUKE:
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
DUKE:
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
DUKE:
What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
DUKE:
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
DUKE:
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
DUKE:
Reads
DUKE:
'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
DUKE:
And slaves they are to me that send them flying
DUKE:
O, could their master come and go as lightly,
DUKE:
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
DUKE:
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
DUKE:
While I, their king, that hither them importune,
DUKE:
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
DUKE:
Because myself do want my servants' fortune
DUKE:
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
DUKE:
That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
DUKE:
What's here?
DUKE:
'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
DUKE:
'Tis so, and here's the ladder for the purpose.
DUKE:
Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--
DUKE:
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
DUKE:
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
DUKE:
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
DUKE:
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
DUKE:
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
DUKE:
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
DUKE:
Is privilege for thy departure hence
DUKE:
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
DUKE:
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
DUKE:
But if thou linger in my territories
DUKE:
Longer than swiftest expedition
DUKE:
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
DUKE:
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
DUKE:
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
DUKE:
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse,
DUKE:
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
DUKE:
Exit
VALENTINE:
And why not death rather than living torment?
VALENTINE:
To die is to be banish'd from myself,
VALENTINE:
And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
VALENTINE:
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
VALENTINE:
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
VALENTINE:
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
VALENTINE:
Unless it be to think that she is by
VALENTINE:
And feed upon the shadow of perfection
VALENTINE:
Except I be by Silvia in the night,
VALENTINE:
There is no music in the nightingale,
VALENTINE:
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
VALENTINE:
There is no day for me to look upon,
VALENTINE:
She is my essence, and I leave to be,
VALENTINE:
If I be not by her fair influence
VALENTINE:
Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
VALENTINE:
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom
VALENTINE:
Tarry I here, I but attend on death
VALENTINE:
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.
VALENTINE:
Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE
PROTEUS:
Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.
LAUNCE:
Soho, soho!
PROTEUS:
What seest thou?
LAUNCE:
Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head
LAUNCE:
but 'tis a Valentine.
PROTEUS:
Valentine?
VALENTINE:
No.
PROTEUS:
Who then? his spirit?
VALENTINE:
Neither.
PROTEUS:
What then?
VALENTINE:
Nothing.
LAUNCE:
Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?
PROTEUS:
Who wouldst thou strike?
LAUNCE:
Nothing.
PROTEUS:
Villain, forbear.
LAUNCE:
Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--
PROTEUS:
Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
VALENTINE:
My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,
VALENTINE:
So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
PROTEUS:
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
PROTEUS:
For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
VALENTINE:
Is Silvia dead?
PROTEUS:
No, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
VALENTINE:
Hath she forsworn me?
PROTEUS:
No, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
VALENTINE:
What is your news?
LAUNCE:
Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
PROTEUS:
That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--
PROTEUS:
From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.
VALENTINE:
O, I have fed upon this woe already,
VALENTINE:
And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
VALENTINE:
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
PROTEUS:
Ay, ay, and she hath offer'd to the doom--
PROTEUS:
Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--
PROTEUS:
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears
PROTEUS:
Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd,
PROTEUS:
With them, upon her knees, her humble self,
PROTEUS:
Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
PROTEUS:
As if but now they waxed pale for woe
PROTEUS:
But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
PROTEUS:
Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
PROTEUS:
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire,
PROTEUS:
But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
PROTEUS:
Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
PROTEUS:
When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
PROTEUS:
That to close prison he commanded her,
PROTEUS:
With many bitter threats of biding there.
VALENTINE:
No more, unless the next word that thou speak'st
VALENTINE:
Have some malignant power upon my life
VALENTINE:
If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,
VALENTINE:
As ending anthem of my endless dolour.
PROTEUS:
Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
PROTEUS:
And study help for that which thou lament'st.
PROTEUS:
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
PROTEUS:
Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love,
PROTEUS:
Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
PROTEUS:
Hope is a lover's staff, walk hence with that
PROTEUS:
And manage it against despairing thoughts.
PROTEUS:
Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,
PROTEUS:
Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
PROTEUS:
Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
PROTEUS:
The time now serves not to expostulate
PROTEUS:
Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate,
PROTEUS:
And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
PROTEUS:
Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
PROTEUS:
As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,
PROTEUS:
Regard thy danger, and along with me!
VALENTINE:
I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
VALENTINE:
Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.
PROTEUS:
Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
VALENTINE:
Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS
LAUNCE:
I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to
LAUNCE:
think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's
LAUNCE:
all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now
LAUNCE:
that knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a
LAUNCE:
team of horse shall not pluck that from me, nor who
LAUNCE:
'tis I love, and yet 'tis a woman, but what woman, I
LAUNCE:
will not tell myself, and yet 'tis a milkmaid, yet
LAUNCE:
'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips, yet 'tis
LAUNCE:
a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for
LAUNCE:
wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel,
LAUNCE:
which is much in a bare Christian.
LAUNCE:
Pulling out a paper
LAUNCE:
Here is the cate-log of her condition.
LAUNCE:
'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse
LAUNCE:
can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only
LAUNCE:
carry, therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item
LAUNCE:
She can milk,' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid
LAUNCE:
with clean hands.
LAUNCE:
Enter SPEED
SPEED:
How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
SPEED:
mastership?
LAUNCE:
With my master's ship? why, it is at sea.
SPEED:
Well, your old vice still, mistake the word. What
SPEED:
news, then, in your paper?
LAUNCE:
The blackest news that ever thou heardest.
SPEED:
Why, man, how black?
LAUNCE:
Why, as black as ink.
SPEED:
Let me read them.
LAUNCE:
Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.
SPEED:
Thou liest, I can.
LAUNCE:
I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?
SPEED:
Marry, the son of my grandfather.
LAUNCE:
O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy
LAUNCE:
grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.
SPEED:
Come, fool, come, try me in thy paper.
LAUNCE:
There, and St. Nicholas be thy speed!
SPEED:
[Reads]  'Imprimis: She can milk.'
LAUNCE:
Ay, that she can.
SPEED:
'Item: She brews good ale.'
LAUNCE:
And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your
LAUNCE:
heart, you brew good ale.'
SPEED:
'Item: She can sew.'
LAUNCE:
That's as much as to say, Can she so?
SPEED:
'Item: She can knit.'
LAUNCE:
What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when
LAUNCE:
she can knit him a stock?
SPEED:
'Item: She can wash and scour.'
LAUNCE:
A special virtue: for then she need not be washed
LAUNCE:
and scoured.
SPEED:
'Item: She can spin.'
LAUNCE:
Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can
LAUNCE:
spin for her living.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'
LAUNCE:
That's as much as to say, bastard virtues, that,
LAUNCE:
indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names.
SPEED:
'Here follow her vices.'
LAUNCE:
Close at the heels of her virtues.
SPEED:
'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect
SPEED:
of her breath.'
LAUNCE:
Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'
LAUNCE:
That makes amends for her sour breath.
SPEED:
'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
LAUNCE:
It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.
SPEED:
'Item: She is slow in words.'
LAUNCE:
O villain, that set this down among her vices! To
LAUNCE:
be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray
LAUNCE:
thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue.
SPEED:
'Item: She is proud.'
LAUNCE:
Out with that too, it was Eve's legacy, and cannot
LAUNCE:
be ta'en from her.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath no teeth.'
LAUNCE:
I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
SPEED:
'Item: She is curst.'
LAUNCE:
Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
SPEED:
'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
LAUNCE:
If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I
LAUNCE:
will, for good things should be praised.
SPEED:
'Item: She is too liberal.'
LAUNCE:
Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she
LAUNCE:
is slow of, of her purse she shall not, for that
LAUNCE:
I'll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and
LAUNCE:
that cannot I help. Well, proceed.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults
SPEED:
than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'
LAUNCE:
Stop there, I'll have her: she was mine, and not
LAUNCE:
mine, twice or thrice in that last article.
LAUNCE:
Rehearse that once more.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--
LAUNCE:
More hair than wit? It may be, I'll prove it. The
LAUNCE:
cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it
LAUNCE:
is more than the salt, the hair that covers the wit
LAUNCE:
is more than the wit, for the greater hides the
LAUNCE:
less. What's next?
SPEED:
'And more faults than hairs,'--
LAUNCE:
That's monstrous: O, that that were out!
SPEED:
'And more wealth than faults.'
LAUNCE:
Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,
LAUNCE:
I'll have her, and if it be a match, as nothing is
LAUNCE:
impossible,--
SPEED:
What then?
LAUNCE:
Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays
LAUNCE:
for thee at the North-gate.
SPEED:
For me?
LAUNCE:
For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a
LAUNCE:
better man than thee.
SPEED:
And must I go to him?
LAUNCE:
Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long
LAUNCE:
that going will scarce serve the turn.
SPEED:
Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!
SPEED:
Exit
LAUNCE:
Now will he be swinged for reading my letter, an
LAUNCE:
unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
LAUNCE:
secrets! I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.
LAUNCE:
Exit
LAUNCE:
SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.
LAUNCE:
Enter DUKE and THURIO
DUKE:
Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
DUKE:
Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
THURIO:
Since his exile she hath despised me most,
THURIO:
Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
THURIO:
That I am desperate of obtaining her.
DUKE:
This weak impress of love is as a figure
DUKE:
Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
DUKE:
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
DUKE:
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
DUKE:
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
DUKE:
Enter PROTEUS
DUKE:
How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
DUKE:
According to our proclamation gone?
PROTEUS:
Gone, my good lord.
DUKE:
My daughter takes his going grievously.
PROTEUS:
A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
DUKE:
So I believe, but Thurio thinks not so.
DUKE:
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
DUKE:
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
DUKE:
Makes me the better to confer with thee.
PROTEUS:
Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
PROTEUS:
Let me not live to look upon your grace.
DUKE:
Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
DUKE:
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
PROTEUS:
I do, my lord.
DUKE:
And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
DUKE:
How she opposes her against my will
PROTEUS:
She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
DUKE:
Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
DUKE:
What might we do to make the girl forget
DUKE:
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
PROTEUS:
The best way is to slander Valentine
PROTEUS:
With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
PROTEUS:
Three things that women highly hold in hate.
DUKE:
Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
PROTEUS:
Ay, if his enemy deliver it
PROTEUS:
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
PROTEUS:
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
DUKE:
Then you must undertake to slander him.
PROTEUS:
And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do
PROTEUS:
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
PROTEUS:
Especially against his very friend.
DUKE:
Where your good word cannot advantage him,
DUKE:
Your slander never can endamage him,
DUKE:
Therefore the office is indifferent,
DUKE:
Being entreated to it by your friend.
PROTEUS:
You have prevail'd, my lord, if I can do it
PROTEUS:
By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,
PROTEUS:
She shall not long continue love to him.
PROTEUS:
But say this weed her love from Valentine,
PROTEUS:
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
THURIO:
Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
THURIO:
Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
THURIO:
You must provide to bottom it on me,
THURIO:
Which must be done by praising me as much
THURIO:
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
DUKE:
And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
DUKE:
Because we know, on Valentine's report,
DUKE:
You are already Love's firm votary
DUKE:
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
DUKE:
Upon this warrant shall you have access
DUKE:
Where you with Silvia may confer at large,
DUKE:
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
DUKE:
And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you,
DUKE:
Where you may temper her by your persuasion
DUKE:
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
PROTEUS:
As much as I can do, I will effect
PROTEUS:
But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough,
PROTEUS:
You must lay lime to tangle her desires
PROTEUS:
By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
PROTEUS:
Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
DUKE:
Ay,
DUKE:
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
PROTEUS:
Say that upon the altar of her beauty
PROTEUS:
You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart
PROTEUS:
Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
PROTEUS:
Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
PROTEUS:
That may discover such integrity
PROTEUS:
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
PROTEUS:
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
PROTEUS:
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
PROTEUS:
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
PROTEUS:
After your dire-lamenting elegies,
PROTEUS:
Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
PROTEUS:
With some sweet concert, to their instruments
PROTEUS:
Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
PROTEUS:
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
PROTEUS:
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
DUKE:
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
THURIO:
And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
THURIO:
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
THURIO:
Let us into the city presently
THURIO:
To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
THURIO:
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
THURIO:
To give the onset to thy good advice.
DUKE:
About it, gentlemen!
PROTEUS:
We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
PROTEUS:
And afterward determine our proceedings.
DUKE:
Even now about it! I will pardon you.
DUKE:
Exeunt
DUKE:
ACT IV
DUKE:
SCENE I. The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.
DUKE:
Enter certain Outlaws
First Outlaw:
Fellows, stand fast, I see a passenger.
Second Outlaw:
If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
Second Outlaw:
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
Third Outlaw:
Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye
Third Outlaw:
If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.
SPEED:
Sir, we are undone, these are the villains
SPEED:
That all the travellers do fear so much.
VALENTINE:
My friends,--
First Outlaw:
That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.
Second Outlaw:
Peace! we'll hear him.
Third Outlaw:
Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.
VALENTINE:
Then know that I have little wealth to lose
VALENTINE:
A man I am cross'd with adversity,
VALENTINE:
My riches are these poor habiliments,
VALENTINE:
Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
VALENTINE:
You take the sum and substance that I have.
Second Outlaw:
Whither travel you?
VALENTINE:
To Verona.
First Outlaw:
Whence came you?
VALENTINE:
From Milan.
Third Outlaw:
Have you long sojourned there?
VALENTINE:
Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
VALENTINE:
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
First Outlaw:
What, were you banish'd thence?
VALENTINE:
I was.
Second Outlaw:
For what offence?
VALENTINE:
For that which now torments me to rehearse
VALENTINE:
I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent,
VALENTINE:
Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,
VALENTINE:
Without false vantage or base treachery.
First Outlaw:
Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
First Outlaw:
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
VALENTINE:
I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
Second Outlaw:
Have you the tongues?
VALENTINE:
My youthful travel therein made me happy,
VALENTINE:
Or else I often had been miserable.
Third Outlaw:
By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
Third Outlaw:
This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
First Outlaw:
We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
SPEED:
Master, be one of them, it's an honourable kind of thievery.
VALENTINE:
Peace, villain!
Second Outlaw:
Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
VALENTINE:
Nothing but my fortune.
Third Outlaw:
Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
Third Outlaw:
Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
Third Outlaw:
Thrust from the company of awful men
Third Outlaw:
Myself was from Verona banished
Third Outlaw:
For practising to steal away a lady,
Third Outlaw:
An heir, and near allied unto the duke.
Second Outlaw:
And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
Second Outlaw:
Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
First Outlaw:
And I for such like petty crimes as these,
First Outlaw:
But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
First Outlaw:
That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives,
First Outlaw:
And partly, seeing you are beautified
First Outlaw:
With goodly shape and by your own report
First Outlaw:
A linguist and a man of such perfection
First Outlaw:
As we do in our quality much want--
Second Outlaw:
Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
Second Outlaw:
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you
Second Outlaw:
Are you content to be our general?
Second Outlaw:
To make a virtue of necessity
Second Outlaw:
And live, as we do, in this wilderness?
Third Outlaw:
What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
Third Outlaw:
Say ay, and be the captain of us all
Third Outlaw:
We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
Third Outlaw:
Love thee as our commander and our king.
First Outlaw:
But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
Second Outlaw:
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
VALENTINE:
I take your offer and will live with you,
VALENTINE:
Provided that you do no outrages
VALENTINE:
On silly women or poor passengers.
Third Outlaw:
No, we detest such vile base practises.
Third Outlaw:
Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
Third Outlaw:
And show thee all the treasure we have got,
Third Outlaw:
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.
Third Outlaw:
Exeunt
Third Outlaw:
SCENE II. Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber.
Third Outlaw:
Enter PROTEUS
PROTEUS:
Already have I been false to Valentine
PROTEUS:
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
PROTEUS:
Under the colour of commending him,
PROTEUS:
I have access my own love to prefer
PROTEUS:
But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
PROTEUS:
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
PROTEUS:
When I protest true loyalty to her,
PROTEUS:
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend,
PROTEUS:
When to her beauty I commend my vows,
PROTEUS:
She bids me think how I have been forsworn
PROTEUS:
In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved
PROTEUS:
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
PROTEUS:
The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
PROTEUS:
Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
PROTEUS:
The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
PROTEUS:
But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
PROTEUS:
And give some evening music to her ear.
PROTEUS:
Enter THURIO and Musicians
THURIO:
How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
PROTEUS:
Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love
PROTEUS:
Will creep in service where it cannot go.
THURIO:
Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
PROTEUS:
Sir, but I do, or else I would be hence.
THURIO:
Who? Silvia?
PROTEUS:
Ay, Silvia, for your sake.
THURIO:
I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
THURIO:
Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
THURIO:
Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes
Host:
Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I
Host:
pray you, why is it?
JULIA:
Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
Host:
Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where
Host:
you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
JULIA:
But shall I hear him speak?
Host:
Ay, that you shall.
JULIA:
That will be music.
JULIA:
Music plays
Host:
Hark, hark!
JULIA:
Is he among these?
Host:
Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.
Host:
SONG.
Host:
Who is Silvia? what is she,
Host:
That all our swains commend her?
Host:
Holy, fair and wise is she,
Host:
The heaven such grace did lend her,
Host:
That she might admired be.
Host:
Is she kind as she is fair?
Host:
For beauty lives with kindness.
Host:
Love doth to her eyes repair,
Host:
To help him of his blindness,
Host:
And, being help'd, inhabits there.
Host:
Then to Silvia let us sing,
Host:
That Silvia is excelling,
Host:
She excels each mortal thing
Host:
Upon the dull earth dwelling
Host:
To her let us garlands bring.
Host:
How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
Host:
do you, man? the music likes you not.
JULIA:
You mistake, the musician likes me not.
Host:
Why, my pretty youth?
JULIA:
He plays false, father.
Host:
How? out of tune on the strings?
JULIA:
Not so, but yet so false that he grieves my very
JULIA:
heart-strings.
Host:
You have a quick ear.
JULIA:
Ay, I would I were deaf, it makes me have a slow heart.
Host:
I perceive you delight not in music.
JULIA:
Not a whit, when it jars so.
Host:
Hark, what fine change is in the music!
JULIA:
Ay, that change is the spite.
Host:
You would have them always play but one thing?
JULIA:
I would always have one play but one thing.
JULIA:
But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
JULIA:
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
Host:
I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved
Host:
her out of all nick.
JULIA:
Where is Launce?
Host:
Gone to seek his dog, which tomorrow, by his
Host:
master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
JULIA:
Peace! stand aside: the company parts.
PROTEUS:
Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
PROTEUS:
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
THURIO:
Where meet we?
PROTEUS:
At Saint Gregory's well.
THURIO:
Farewell.
THURIO:
Exeunt THURIO and Musicians
THURIO:
Enter SILVIA above
PROTEUS:
Madam, good even to your ladyship.
SILVIA:
I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
SILVIA:
Who is that that spake?
PROTEUS:
One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
PROTEUS:
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
SILVIA:
Sir Proteus, as I take it.
PROTEUS:
Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
SILVIA:
What's your will?
PROTEUS:
That I may compass yours.
SILVIA:
You have your wish, my will is even this
SILVIA:
That presently you hie you home to bed.
SILVIA:
Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
SILVIA:
Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
SILVIA:
To be seduced by thy flattery,
SILVIA:
That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
SILVIA:
Return, return, and make thy love amends.
SILVIA:
For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
SILVIA:
I am so far from granting thy request
SILVIA:
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
SILVIA:
And by and by intend to chide myself
SILVIA:
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
PROTEUS:
I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady,
PROTEUS:
But she is dead.
JULIA:
[Aside]        'Twere false, if I should speak it,
JULIA:
For I am sure she is not buried.
SILVIA:
Say that she be, yet Valentine thy friend
SILVIA:
Survives, to whom, thyself art witness,
SILVIA:
I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
SILVIA:
To wrong him with thy importunacy?
PROTEUS:
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
SILVIA:
And so suppose am I, for in his grave
SILVIA:
Assure thyself my love is buried.
PROTEUS:
Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
SILVIA:
Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
SILVIA:
Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
JULIA:
[Aside]  He heard not that.
PROTEUS:
Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
PROTEUS:
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
PROTEUS:
The picture that is hanging in your chamber,
PROTEUS:
To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep
PROTEUS:
For since the substance of your perfect self
PROTEUS:
Is else devoted, I am but a shadow,
PROTEUS:
And to your shadow will I make true love.
JULIA:
[Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,
JULIA:
deceive it,
JULIA:
And make it but a shadow, as I am.
SILVIA:
I am very loath to be your idol, sir,
SILVIA:
But since your falsehood shall become you well
SILVIA:
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
SILVIA:
Send to me in the morning and I'll send it
SILVIA:
And so, good rest.
PROTEUS:
As wretches have o'ernight
PROTEUS:
That wait for execution in the morn.
PROTEUS:
Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally
JULIA:
Host, will you go?
Host:
By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
JULIA:
Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
Host:
Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost
Host:
day.
JULIA:
Not so, but it hath been the longest night
JULIA:
That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.
JULIA:
Exeunt
JULIA:
SCENE III. The same.
JULIA:
Enter EGLAMOUR
EGLAMOUR:
This is the hour that Madam Silvia
EGLAMOUR:
Entreated me to call and know her mind
EGLAMOUR:
There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
EGLAMOUR:
Madam, madam!
EGLAMOUR:
Enter SILVIA above
SILVIA:
Who calls?
EGLAMOUR:
Your servant and your friend,
EGLAMOUR:
One that attends your ladyship's command.
SILVIA:
Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.
EGLAMOUR:
As many, worthy lady, to yourself
EGLAMOUR:
According to your ladyship's impose,
EGLAMOUR:
I am thus early come to know what service
EGLAMOUR:
It is your pleasure to command me in.
SILVIA:
O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
SILVIA:
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
SILVIA:
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd
SILVIA:
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
SILVIA:
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,
SILVIA:
Nor how my father would enforce me marry
SILVIA:
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
SILVIA:
Thyself hast loved, and I have heard thee say
SILVIA:
No grief did ever come so near thy heart
SILVIA:
As when thy lady and thy true love died,
SILVIA:
Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
SILVIA:
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
SILVIA:
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode,
SILVIA:
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
SILVIA:
I do desire thy worthy company,
SILVIA:
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
SILVIA:
Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
SILVIA:
But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
SILVIA:
And on the justice of my flying hence,
SILVIA:
To keep me from a most unholy match,
SILVIA:
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
SILVIA:
I do desire thee, even from a heart
SILVIA:
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
SILVIA:
To bear me company and go with me
SILVIA:
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
SILVIA:
That I may venture to depart alone.
EGLAMOUR:
Madam, I pity much your grievances,
EGLAMOUR:
Which since I know they virtuously are placed,
EGLAMOUR:
I give consent to go along with you,
EGLAMOUR:
Recking as little what betideth me
EGLAMOUR:
As much I wish all good befortune you.
EGLAMOUR:
When will you go?
SILVIA:
This evening coming.
EGLAMOUR:
Where shall I meet you?
SILVIA:
At Friar Patrick's cell,
SILVIA:
Where I intend holy confession.
EGLAMOUR:
I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
SILVIA:
Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.
SILVIA:
Exeunt severally
SILVIA:
SCENE IV. The same.
SILVIA:
Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog
LAUNCE:
When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
LAUNCE:
look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
LAUNCE:
puppy, one that I saved from drowning, when three or
LAUNCE:
four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
LAUNCE:
I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
LAUNCE:
'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
LAUNCE:
him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master,
LAUNCE:
and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
LAUNCE:
steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg
LAUNCE:
O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
LAUNCE:
in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
LAUNCE:
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
LAUNCE:
as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
LAUNCE:
more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
LAUNCE:
I think verily he had been hanged for't, sure as I
LAUNCE:
live, he had suffered for't, you shall judge. He
LAUNCE:
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
LAUNCE:
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
LAUNCE:
not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
LAUNCE:
all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
LAUNCE:
one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
LAUNCE:
out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
LAUNCE:
I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
LAUNCE:
knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
LAUNCE:
whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
LAUNCE:
the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
LAUNCE:
the more wrong,' quoth I, ''twas I did the thing you
LAUNCE:
wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
LAUNCE:
of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
LAUNCE:
his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
LAUNCE:
stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
LAUNCE:
been executed, I have stood on the pillory for geese
LAUNCE:
he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
LAUNCE:
Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
LAUNCE:
trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
LAUNCE:
Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
LAUNCE:
do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
LAUNCE:
water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
LAUNCE:
thou ever see me do such a trick?
LAUNCE:
Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
PROTEUS:
Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
PROTEUS:
And will employ thee in some service presently.
JULIA:
In what you please: I'll do what I can.
PROTEUS:
I hope thou wilt.
PROTEUS:
To LAUNCE
PROTEUS:
How now, you whoreson peasant!
PROTEUS:
Where have you been these two days loitering?
LAUNCE:
Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
PROTEUS:
And what says she to my little jewel?
LAUNCE:
Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you
LAUNCE:
currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
PROTEUS:
But she received my dog?
LAUNCE:
No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
LAUNCE:
back again.
PROTEUS:
What, didst thou offer her this from me?
LAUNCE:
Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
LAUNCE:
the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
LAUNCE:
offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
LAUNCE:
yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
PROTEUS:
Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
PROTEUS:
Or ne'er return again into my sight.
PROTEUS:
Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?
PROTEUS:
Exit LAUNCE
PROTEUS:
A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
PROTEUS:
Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
PROTEUS:
Partly that I have need of such a youth
PROTEUS:
That can with some discretion do my business,
PROTEUS:
For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
PROTEUS:
But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
PROTEUS:
Which, if my augury deceive me not,
PROTEUS:
Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth
PROTEUS:
Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
PROTEUS:
Go presently and take this ring with thee,
PROTEUS:
Deliver it to Madam Silvia
PROTEUS:
She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
JULIA:
It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
JULIA:
She is dead, belike?
PROTEUS:
Not so, I think she lives.
JULIA:
Alas!
PROTEUS:
Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
JULIA:
I cannot choose
JULIA:
But pity her.
PROTEUS:
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
JULIA:
Because methinks that she loved you as well
JULIA:
As you do love your lady Silvia
JULIA:
She dreams of him that has forgot her love,
JULIA:
You dote on her that cares not for your love.
JULIA:
'Tis pity love should be so contrary,
JULIA:
And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
PROTEUS:
Well, give her that ring and therewithal
PROTEUS:
This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
PROTEUS:
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
PROTEUS:
Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
PROTEUS:
Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.
PROTEUS:
Exit
JULIA:
How many women would do such a message?
JULIA:
Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
JULIA:
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
JULIA:
Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
JULIA:
That with his very heart despiseth me?
JULIA:
Because he loves her, he despiseth me,
JULIA:
Because I love him I must pity him.
JULIA:
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
JULIA:
To bind him to remember my good will,
JULIA:
And now am I, unhappy messenger,
JULIA:
To plead for that which I would not obtain,
JULIA:
To carry that which I would have refused,
JULIA:
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
JULIA:
I am my master's true-confirmed love,
JULIA:
But cannot be true servant to my master,
JULIA:
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
JULIA:
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
JULIA:
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
JULIA:
Enter SILVIA, attended
JULIA:
Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
JULIA:
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
SILVIA:
What would you with her, if that I be she?
JULIA:
If you be she, I do entreat your patience
JULIA:
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
SILVIA:
From whom?
JULIA:
From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
SILVIA:
O, he sends you for a picture.
JULIA:
Ay, madam.
SILVIA:
Ursula, bring my picture here.
SILVIA:
Go give your master this: tell him from me,
SILVIA:
One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
SILVIA:
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
JULIA:
Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
JULIA:
Pardon me, madam, I have unadvised
JULIA:
Deliver'd you a paper that I should not
JULIA:
This is the letter to your ladyship.
SILVIA:
I pray thee, let me look on that again.
JULIA:
It may not be, good madam, pardon me.
SILVIA:
There, hold!
SILVIA:
I will not look upon your master's lines
SILVIA:
I know they are stuff'd with protestations
SILVIA:
And full of new-found oaths, which he will break
SILVIA:
As easily as I do tear his paper.
JULIA:
Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
SILVIA:
The more shame for him that he sends it me,
SILVIA:
For I have heard him say a thousand times
SILVIA:
His Julia gave it him at his departure.
SILVIA:
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
SILVIA:
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
JULIA:
She thanks you.
SILVIA:
What say'st thou?
JULIA:
I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
JULIA:
Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
SILVIA:
Dost thou know her?
JULIA:
Almost as well as I do know myself
JULIA:
To think upon her woes I do protest
JULIA:
That I have wept a hundred several times.
SILVIA:
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
JULIA:
I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
SILVIA:
Is she not passing fair?
JULIA:
She hath been fairer, madam, than she is
JULIA:
When she did think my master loved her well,
JULIA:
She, in my judgment, was as fair as you
JULIA:
But since she did neglect her looking-glass
JULIA:
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
JULIA:
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
JULIA:
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
JULIA:
That now she is become as black as I.
SILVIA:
How tall was she?
JULIA:
About my stature, for at Pentecost,
JULIA:
When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
JULIA:
Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
JULIA:
And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
JULIA:
Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
JULIA:
As if the garment had been made for me
JULIA:
Therefore I know she is about my height.
JULIA:
And at that time I made her weep agood,
JULIA:
For I did play a lamentable part
JULIA:
Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
JULIA:
For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight,
JULIA:
Which I so lively acted with my tears
JULIA:
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
JULIA:
Wept bitterly, and would I might be dead
JULIA:
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
SILVIA:
She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
SILVIA:
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
SILVIA:
I weep myself to think upon thy words.
SILVIA:
Here, youth, there is my purse, I give thee this
SILVIA:
For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
SILVIA:
Farewell.
SILVIA:
Exit SILVIA, with attendants
JULIA:
And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
JULIA:
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
JULIA:
I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
JULIA:
Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
JULIA:
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
JULIA:
Here is her picture: let me see, I think,
JULIA:
If I had such a tire, this face of mine
JULIA:
Were full as lovely as is this of hers
JULIA:
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
JULIA:
Unless I flatter with myself too much.
JULIA:
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow
JULIA:
If that be all the difference in his love,
JULIA:
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
JULIA:
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine
JULIA:
Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
JULIA:
What should it be that he respects in her
JULIA:
But I can make respective in myself,
JULIA:
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
JULIA:
Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
JULIA:
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
JULIA:
Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
JULIA:
And, were there sense in his idolatry,
JULIA:
My substance should be statue in thy stead.
JULIA:
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
JULIA:
That used me so, or else, by Jove I vow,
JULIA:
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
JULIA:
To make my master out of love with thee!
JULIA:
Exit
JULIA:
ACT V
JULIA:
SCENE I. Milan. An abbey.
JULIA:
Enter EGLAMOUR
EGLAMOUR:
The sun begins to gild the western sky,
EGLAMOUR:
And now it is about the very hour
EGLAMOUR:
That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
EGLAMOUR:
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
EGLAMOUR:
Unless it be to come before their time,
EGLAMOUR:
So much they spur their expedition.
EGLAMOUR:
See where she comes.
EGLAMOUR:
Enter SILVIA
EGLAMOUR:
Lady, a happy evening!
SILVIA:
Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
SILVIA:
Out at the postern by the abbey-wall
SILVIA:
I fear I am attended by some spies.
EGLAMOUR:
Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off,
EGLAMOUR:
If we recover that, we are sure enough.
EGLAMOUR:
Exeunt
EGLAMOUR:
SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.
EGLAMOUR:
Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA
THURIO:
Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
PROTEUS:
O, sir, I find her milder than she was,
PROTEUS:
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
THURIO:
What, that my leg is too long?
PROTEUS:
No, that it is too little.
THURIO:
I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.
JULIA:
[Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what
JULIA:
it loathes.
THURIO:
What says she to my face?
PROTEUS:
She says it is a fair one.
THURIO:
Nay then, the wanton lies, my face is black.
PROTEUS:
But pearls are fair, and the old saying is,
PROTEUS:
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
JULIA:
[Aside]  'Tis true, such pearls as put out
JULIA:
ladies' eyes,
JULIA:
For I had rather wink than look on them.
THURIO:
How likes she my discourse?
PROTEUS:
Ill, when you talk of war.
THURIO:
But well, when I discourse of love and peace?
JULIA:
[Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
THURIO:
What says she to my valour?
PROTEUS:
O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
JULIA:
[Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
THURIO:
What says she to my birth?
PROTEUS:
That you are well derived.
JULIA:
[Aside]  True, from a gentleman to a fool.
THURIO:
Considers she my possessions?
PROTEUS:
O, ay, and pities them.
THURIO:
Wherefore?
JULIA:
[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
PROTEUS:
That they are out by lease.
JULIA:
Here comes the duke.
JULIA:
Enter DUKE
DUKE:
How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
DUKE:
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
THURIO:
Not I.
PROTEUS:
Nor I.
DUKE:
Saw you my daughter?
PROTEUS:
Neither.
DUKE:
Why then,
DUKE:
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine,
DUKE:
And Eglamour is in her company.
DUKE:
'Tis true, for Friar Laurence met them both,
DUKE:
As he in penance wander'd through the forest,
DUKE:
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
DUKE:
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it,
DUKE:
Besides, she did intend confession
DUKE:
At Patrick's cell this even, and there she was not,
DUKE:
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
DUKE:
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
DUKE:
But mount you presently and meet with me
DUKE:
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
DUKE:
That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled
DUKE:
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
DUKE:
Exit
THURIO:
Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
THURIO:
That flies her fortune when it follows her.
THURIO:
I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
THURIO:
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
THURIO:
Exit
PROTEUS:
And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
PROTEUS:
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
PROTEUS:
Exit
JULIA:
And I will follow, more to cross that love
JULIA:
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
JULIA:
Exit
JULIA:
SCENE III. The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.
JULIA:
Enter Outlaws with SILVIA
First Outlaw:
Come, come,
First Outlaw:
Be patient, we must bring you to our captain.
SILVIA:
A thousand more mischances than this one
SILVIA:
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
Second Outlaw:
Come, bring her away.
First Outlaw:
Where is the gentleman that was with her?
Third Outlaw:
Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
Third Outlaw:
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
Third Outlaw:
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood,
Third Outlaw:
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled,
Third Outlaw:
The thicket is beset, he cannot 'scape.
First Outlaw:
Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave
First Outlaw:
Fear not, he bears an honourable mind,
First Outlaw:
And will not use a woman lawlessly.
SILVIA:
O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
SILVIA:
Exeunt
SILVIA:
SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.
SILVIA:
Enter VALENTINE
VALENTINE:
How use doth breed a habit in a man!
VALENTINE:
This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
VALENTINE:
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns
VALENTINE:
Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
VALENTINE:
And to the nightingale's complaining notes
VALENTINE:
Tune my distresses and record my woes.
VALENTINE:
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
VALENTINE:
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
VALENTINE:
Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
VALENTINE:
And leave no memory of what it was!
VALENTINE:
Repair me with thy presence, Silvia,
VALENTINE:
Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
VALENTINE:
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
VALENTINE:
These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
VALENTINE:
Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
VALENTINE:
They love me well, yet I have much to do
VALENTINE:
To keep them from uncivil outrages.
VALENTINE:
Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?
VALENTINE:
Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA
PROTEUS:
Madam, this service I have done for you,
PROTEUS:
Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
PROTEUS:
To hazard life and rescue you from him
PROTEUS:
That would have forced your honour and your love,
PROTEUS:
Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look,
PROTEUS:
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
PROTEUS:
And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
VALENTINE:
[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
VALENTINE:
Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
SILVIA:
O miserable, unhappy that I am!
PROTEUS:
Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came,
PROTEUS:
But by my coming I have made you happy.
SILVIA:
By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
JULIA:
[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
SILVIA:
Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
SILVIA:
I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
SILVIA:
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
SILVIA:
O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
SILVIA:
Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
SILVIA:
And full as much, for more there cannot be,
SILVIA:
I do detest false perjured Proteus.
SILVIA:
Therefore be gone, solicit me no more.
PROTEUS:
What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
PROTEUS:
Would I not undergo for one calm look!
PROTEUS:
O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
PROTEUS:
When women cannot love where they're beloved!
SILVIA:
When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
SILVIA:
Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
SILVIA:
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
SILVIA:
Into a thousand oaths, and all those oaths
SILVIA:
Descended into perjury, to love me.
SILVIA:
Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two,
SILVIA:
And that's far worse than none, better have none
SILVIA:
Than plural faith which is too much by one
SILVIA:
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
PROTEUS:
In love
PROTEUS:
Who respects friend?
SILVIA:
All men but Proteus.
PROTEUS:
Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
PROTEUS:
Can no way change you to a milder form,
PROTEUS:
I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
PROTEUS:
And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.
SILVIA:
O heaven!
PROTEUS:
I'll force thee yield to my desire.
VALENTINE:
Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
VALENTINE:
Thou friend of an ill fashion!
PROTEUS:
Valentine!
VALENTINE:
Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
VALENTINE:
For such is a friend now, treacherous man!
VALENTINE:
Thou hast beguiled my hopes, nought but mine eye
VALENTINE:
Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
VALENTINE:
I have one friend alive, thou wouldst disprove me.
VALENTINE:
Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
VALENTINE:
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
VALENTINE:
I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
VALENTINE:
But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
VALENTINE:
The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
VALENTINE:
'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
PROTEUS:
My shame and guilt confounds me.
PROTEUS:
Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
PROTEUS:
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
PROTEUS:
I tender 't here, I do as truly suffer
PROTEUS:
As e'er I did commit.
VALENTINE:
Then I am paid,
VALENTINE:
And once again I do receive thee honest.
VALENTINE:
Who by repentance is not satisfied
VALENTINE:
Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
VALENTINE:
By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased
VALENTINE:
And, that my love may appear plain and free,
VALENTINE:
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
JULIA:
O me unhappy!
JULIA:
Swoons
PROTEUS:
Look to the boy.
VALENTINE:
Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?
VALENTINE:
Look up, speak.
JULIA:
O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
JULIA:
to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
PROTEUS:
Where is that ring, boy?
JULIA:
Here 'tis, this is it.
PROTEUS:
How! let me see
PROTEUS:
Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
JULIA:
O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook
JULIA:
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
PROTEUS:
But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
PROTEUS:
I gave this unto Julia.
JULIA:
And Julia herself did give it me,
JULIA:
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
PROTEUS:
How! Julia!
JULIA:
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
JULIA:
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
JULIA:
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
JULIA:
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
JULIA:
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
JULIA:
Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
JULIA:
In a disguise of love
JULIA:
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
JULIA:
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
PROTEUS:
Than men their minds! 'tis true.
PROTEUS:
O heaven! were man
PROTEUS:
But constant, he were perfect. That one error
PROTEUS:
Fills him with faults, makes him run through all the sins
PROTEUS:
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
PROTEUS:
What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
PROTEUS:
More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
VALENTINE:
Come, come, a hand from either
VALENTINE:
Let me be blest to make this happy close,
VALENTINE:
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
PROTEUS:
Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.
JULIA:
And I mine.
JULIA:
Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO
Outlaws:
A prize, a prize, a prize!
VALENTINE:
Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.
VALENTINE:
Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
VALENTINE:
Banished Valentine.
DUKE:
Sir Valentine!
THURIO:
Yonder is Silvia, and Silvia's mine.
VALENTINE:
Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death,
VALENTINE:
Come not within the measure of my wrath,
VALENTINE:
Do not name Silvia thine, if once again,
VALENTINE:
Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands,
VALENTINE:
Take but possession of her with a touch
VALENTINE:
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
THURIO:
Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I,
THURIO:
I hold him but a fool that will endanger
THURIO:
His body for a girl that loves him not
THURIO:
I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
DUKE:
The more degenerate and base art thou,
DUKE:
To make such means for her as thou hast done
DUKE:
And leave her on such slight conditions.
DUKE:
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
DUKE:
I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
DUKE:
And think thee worthy of an empress' love
DUKE:
Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
DUKE:
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
DUKE:
Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
DUKE:
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
DUKE:
Thou art a gentleman and well derived,
DUKE:
Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.
VALENTINE:
I thank your grace, the gift hath made me happy.
VALENTINE:
I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
VALENTINE:
To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.
DUKE:
I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.
VALENTINE:
These banish'd men that I have kept withal
VALENTINE:
Are men endued with worthy qualities
VALENTINE:
Forgive them what they have committed here
VALENTINE:
And let them be recall'd from their exile
VALENTINE:
They are reformed, civil, full of good
VALENTINE:
And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
DUKE:
Thou hast prevail'd, I pardon them and thee
DUKE:
Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
DUKE:
Come, let us go: we will include all jars
DUKE:
With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.
VALENTINE:
And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
VALENTINE:
With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
VALENTINE:
What think you of this page, my lord?
DUKE:
I think the boy hath grace in him, he blushes.
VALENTINE:
I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
DUKE:
What mean you by that saying?
VALENTINE:
Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
VALENTINE:
That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
VALENTINE:
Come, Proteus, 'tis your penance but to hear
VALENTINE:
The story of your loves discovered
VALENTINE:
That done, our day of marriage shall be yours,
VALENTINE:
One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
VALENTINE:
Exeunt
