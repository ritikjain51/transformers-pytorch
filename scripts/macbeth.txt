ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
ACT I
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
SCENE I. A desert place.
ADRIANO DE ARMADO:
Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches
First Witch:
When shall we three meet again
First Witch:
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
Second Witch:
When the hurlyburly's done,
Second Witch:
When the battle's lost and won.
Third Witch:
That will be ere the set of sun.
First Witch:
Where the place?
Second Witch:
Upon the heath.
Third Witch:
There to meet with Macbeth.
First Witch:
I come, Graymalkin!
Second Witch:
Paddock calls.
Third Witch:
Anon.
ALL:
Fair is foul, and foul is fair
ALL:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
ALL:
Exeunt
ALL:
SCENE II. A camp near Forres.
ALL:
Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant
DUNCAN:
What bloody man is that? He can report,
DUNCAN:
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
DUNCAN:
The newest state.
MALCOLM:
This is the sergeant
MALCOLM:
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
MALCOLM:
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
MALCOLM:
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
MALCOLM:
As thou didst leave it.
Sergeant:
Doubtful it stood,
Sergeant:
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
Sergeant:
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
Sergeant:
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
Sergeant:
The multiplying villanies of nature
Sergeant:
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
Sergeant:
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied,
Sergeant:
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Sergeant:
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak
Sergeant:
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
Sergeant:
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Sergeant:
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Sergeant:
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Sergeant:
Till he faced the slave,
Sergeant:
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Sergeant:
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
Sergeant:
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
DUNCAN:
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
Sergeant:
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Sergeant:
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
Sergeant:
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
Sergeant:
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark
Sergeant:
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
Sergeant:
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
Sergeant:
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
Sergeant:
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
Sergeant:
Began a fresh assault.
DUNCAN:
Dismay'd not this
DUNCAN:
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
Sergeant:
Yes,
Sergeant:
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
Sergeant:
If I say sooth, I must report they were
Sergeant:
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
Sergeant:
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
Sergeant:
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
Sergeant:
Or memorise another Golgotha,
Sergeant:
I cannot tell.
Sergeant:
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
DUNCAN:
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds,
DUNCAN:
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
DUNCAN:
Exit Sergeant, attended
DUNCAN:
Who comes here?
DUNCAN:
Enter ROSS
MALCOLM:
The worthy thane of Ross.
LENNOX:
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
LENNOX:
That seems to speak things strange.
ROSS:
God save the king!
DUNCAN:
Whence camest thou, worthy thane?
ROSS:
From Fife, great king,
ROSS:
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
ROSS:
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
ROSS:
With terrible numbers,
ROSS:
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
ROSS:
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
ROSS:
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
ROSS:
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
ROSS:
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
ROSS:
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
ROSS:
The victory fell on us.
DUNCAN:
Great happiness!
ROSS:
That now
ROSS:
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition
ROSS:
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
ROSS:
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
ROSS:
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
DUNCAN:
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
DUNCAN:
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
DUNCAN:
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
ROSS:
I'll see it done.
DUNCAN:
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.
DUNCAN:
Exeunt
DUNCAN:
SCENE III. A heath near Forres.
DUNCAN:
Thunder. Enter the three Witches
First Witch:
Where hast thou been, sister?
Second Witch:
Killing swine.
Third Witch:
Sister, where thou?
First Witch:
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
First Witch:
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
First Witch:
'Give me,' quoth I
First Witch:
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
First Witch:
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger
First Witch:
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
First Witch:
And, like a rat without a tail,
First Witch:
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
Second Witch:
I'll give thee a wind.
First Witch:
Thou'rt kind.
Third Witch:
And I another.
First Witch:
I myself have all the other,
First Witch:
And the very ports they blow,
First Witch:
All the quarters that they know
First Witch:
I' the shipman's card.
First Witch:
I will drain him dry as hay
First Witch:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
First Witch:
Hang upon his pent-house lid,
First Witch:
He shall live a man forbid
First Witch:
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
First Witch:
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine
First Witch:
Though his bark cannot be lost,
First Witch:
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
First Witch:
Look what I have.
Second Witch:
Show me, show me.
First Witch:
Here I have a pilot's thumb,
First Witch:
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
First Witch:
Drum within
Third Witch:
A drum, a drum!
Third Witch:
Macbeth doth come.
ALL:
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
ALL:
Posters of the sea and land,
ALL:
Thus do go about, about
ALL:
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
ALL:
And thrice again, to make up nine.
ALL:
Peace! the charm's wound up.
ALL:
Enter MACBETH and BANQUO
MACBETH:
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
BANQUO:
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
BANQUO:
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
BANQUO:
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
BANQUO:
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
BANQUO:
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
BANQUO:
By each at once her chappy finger laying
BANQUO:
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
BANQUO:
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
BANQUO:
That you are so.
MACBETH:
Speak, if you can: what are you?
First Witch:
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
Second Witch:
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!
Third Witch:
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
BANQUO:
Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
BANQUO:
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
BANQUO:
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
BANQUO:
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
BANQUO:
You greet with present grace and great prediction
BANQUO:
Of noble having and of royal hope,
BANQUO:
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
BANQUO:
If you can look into the seeds of time,
BANQUO:
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
BANQUO:
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
BANQUO:
Your favours nor your hate.
First Witch:
Hail!
Second Witch:
Hail!
Third Witch:
Hail!
First Witch:
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
Second Witch:
Not so happy, yet much happier.
Third Witch:
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none
Third Witch:
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
First Witch:
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
MACBETH:
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more
MACBETH:
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis,
MACBETH:
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
MACBETH:
A prosperous gentleman, and to be king
MACBETH:
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
MACBETH:
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
MACBETH:
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
MACBETH:
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
MACBETH:
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
MACBETH:
Witches vanish
BANQUO:
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
BANQUO:
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
MACBETH:
Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted
MACBETH:
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
BANQUO:
Were such things here as we do speak about?
BANQUO:
Or have we eaten on the insane root
BANQUO:
That takes the reason prisoner?
MACBETH:
Your children shall be kings.
BANQUO:
You shall be king.
MACBETH:
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
BANQUO:
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
BANQUO:
Enter ROSS and ANGUS
ROSS:
The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
ROSS:
The news of thy success, and when he reads
ROSS:
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
ROSS:
His wonders and his praises do contend
ROSS:
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
ROSS:
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
ROSS:
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
ROSS:
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
ROSS:
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
ROSS:
Came post with post, and every one did bear
ROSS:
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
ROSS:
And pour'd them down before him.
ANGUS:
We are sent
ANGUS:
To give thee from our royal master thanks,
ANGUS:
Only to herald thee into his sight,
ANGUS:
Not pay thee.
ROSS:
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
ROSS:
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor
ROSS:
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
ROSS:
For it is thine.
BANQUO:
What, can the devil speak true?
MACBETH:
The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
MACBETH:
In borrow'd robes?
ANGUS:
Who was the thane lives yet,
ANGUS:
But under heavy judgment bears that life
ANGUS:
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
ANGUS:
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
ANGUS:
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
ANGUS:
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not,
ANGUS:
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
ANGUS:
Have overthrown him.
MACBETH:
[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
MACBETH:
The greatest is behind.
MACBETH:
To ROSS and ANGUS
MACBETH:
Thanks for your pains.
MACBETH:
To BANQUO
MACBETH:
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
MACBETH:
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
MACBETH:
Promised no less to them?
BANQUO:
That trusted home
BANQUO:
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
BANQUO:
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange
BANQUO:
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
BANQUO:
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
BANQUO:
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
BANQUO:
In deepest consequence.
BANQUO:
Cousins, a word, I pray you.
MACBETH:
[Aside]	Two truths are told,
MACBETH:
As happy prologues to the swelling act
MACBETH:
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
MACBETH:
Aside
MACBETH:
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
MACBETH:
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
MACBETH:
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor
MACBETH:
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
MACBETH:
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
MACBETH:
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
MACBETH:
Against the use of nature? Present fears
MACBETH:
Are less than horrible imaginings
MACBETH:
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
MACBETH:
Shakes so my single state of man that function
MACBETH:
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
MACBETH:
But what is not.
BANQUO:
Look, how our partner's rapt.
MACBETH:
[Aside]  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
MACBETH:
Without my stir.
BANQUO:
New horrors come upon him,
BANQUO:
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
BANQUO:
But with the aid of use.
MACBETH:
[Aside]                Come what come may,
MACBETH:
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
BANQUO:
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
MACBETH:
Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
MACBETH:
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
MACBETH:
Are register'd where every day I turn
MACBETH:
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
MACBETH:
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
MACBETH:
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
MACBETH:
Our free hearts each to other.
BANQUO:
Very gladly.
MACBETH:
Till then, enough. Come, friends.
MACBETH:
Exeunt
MACBETH:
SCENE IV. Forres. The palace.
MACBETH:
Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and Attendants
DUNCAN:
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
DUNCAN:
Those in commission yet return'd?
MALCOLM:
My liege,
MALCOLM:
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
MALCOLM:
With one that saw him die: who did report
MALCOLM:
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
MALCOLM:
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
MALCOLM:
A deep repentance: nothing in his life
MALCOLM:
Became him like the leaving it, he died
MALCOLM:
As one that had been studied in his death
MALCOLM:
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
MALCOLM:
As 'twere a careless trifle.
DUNCAN:
There's no art
DUNCAN:
To find the mind's construction in the face
DUNCAN:
He was a gentleman on whom I built
DUNCAN:
An absolute trust.
DUNCAN:
Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS
DUNCAN:
O worthiest cousin!
DUNCAN:
The sin of my ingratitude even now
DUNCAN:
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
DUNCAN:
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
DUNCAN:
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
DUNCAN:
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
DUNCAN:
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
DUNCAN:
More is thy due than more than all can pay.
MACBETH:
The service and the loyalty I owe,
MACBETH:
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
MACBETH:
Is to receive our duties, and our duties
MACBETH:
Are to your throne and state children and servants,
MACBETH:
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
MACBETH:
Safe toward your love and honour.
DUNCAN:
Welcome hither
DUNCAN:
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
DUNCAN:
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
DUNCAN:
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
DUNCAN:
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
DUNCAN:
And hold thee to my heart.
BANQUO:
There if I grow,
BANQUO:
The harvest is your own.
DUNCAN:
My plenteous joys,
DUNCAN:
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
DUNCAN:
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
DUNCAN:
And you whose places are the nearest, know
DUNCAN:
We will establish our estate upon
DUNCAN:
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
DUNCAN:
The Prince of Cumberland, which honour must
DUNCAN:
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
DUNCAN:
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
DUNCAN:
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
DUNCAN:
And bind us further to you.
MACBETH:
The rest is labour, which is not used for you
MACBETH:
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
MACBETH:
The hearing of my wife with your approach,
MACBETH:
So humbly take my leave.
DUNCAN:
My worthy Cawdor!
MACBETH:
[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
MACBETH:
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
MACBETH:
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires,
MACBETH:
Let not light see my black and deep desires
MACBETH:
The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be,
MACBETH:
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
MACBETH:
Exit
DUNCAN:
True, worthy Banquo, he is full so valiant,
DUNCAN:
And in his commendations I am fed,
DUNCAN:
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
DUNCAN:
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
DUNCAN:
It is a peerless kinsman.
DUNCAN:
Flourish. Exeunt
DUNCAN:
SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.
DUNCAN:
Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter
LADY MACBETH:
'They met me in the day of success: and I have
LADY MACBETH:
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
LADY MACBETH:
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
LADY MACBETH:
to question them further, they made themselves air,
LADY MACBETH:
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
LADY MACBETH:
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
LADY MACBETH:
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor,' by which title,
LADY MACBETH:
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
LADY MACBETH:
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
LADY MACBETH:
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
LADY MACBETH:
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
LADY MACBETH:
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
LADY MACBETH:
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
LADY MACBETH:
to thy heart, and farewell.'
LADY MACBETH:
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
LADY MACBETH:
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature,
LADY MACBETH:
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
LADY MACBETH:
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great,
LADY MACBETH:
Art not without ambition, but without
LADY MACBETH:
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
LADY MACBETH:
That wouldst thou holily, wouldst not play false,
LADY MACBETH:
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
LADY MACBETH:
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it,
LADY MACBETH:
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
LADY MACBETH:
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
LADY MACBETH:
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
LADY MACBETH:
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
LADY MACBETH:
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
LADY MACBETH:
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
LADY MACBETH:
To have thee crown'd withal.
LADY MACBETH:
Enter a Messenger
LADY MACBETH:
What is your tidings?
Messenger:
The king comes here to-night.
LADY MACBETH:
Thou'rt mad to say it
LADY MACBETH:
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
LADY MACBETH:
Would have inform'd for preparation.
Messenger:
So please you, it is true: our thane is coming
Messenger:
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Messenger:
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Messenger:
Than would make up his message.
LADY MACBETH:
Give him tending,
LADY MACBETH:
He brings great news.
LADY MACBETH:
Exit Messenger
LADY MACBETH:
The raven himself is hoarse
LADY MACBETH:
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
LADY MACBETH:
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
LADY MACBETH:
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
LADY MACBETH:
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
LADY MACBETH:
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood,
LADY MACBETH:
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
LADY MACBETH:
That no compunctious visitings of nature
LADY MACBETH:
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
LADY MACBETH:
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
LADY MACBETH:
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
LADY MACBETH:
Wherever in your sightless substances
LADY MACBETH:
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
LADY MACBETH:
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
LADY MACBETH:
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
LADY MACBETH:
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
LADY MACBETH:
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
LADY MACBETH:
Enter MACBETH
LADY MACBETH:
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
LADY MACBETH:
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
LADY MACBETH:
Thy letters have transported me beyond
LADY MACBETH:
This ignorant present, and I feel now
LADY MACBETH:
The future in the instant.
MACBETH:
My dearest love,
MACBETH:
Duncan comes here to-night.
LADY MACBETH:
And when goes hence?
MACBETH:
To-morrow, as he purposes.
LADY MACBETH:
O, never
LADY MACBETH:
Shall sun that morrow see!
LADY MACBETH:
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
LADY MACBETH:
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
LADY MACBETH:
Look like the time, bear welcome in your eye,
LADY MACBETH:
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
LADY MACBETH:
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
LADY MACBETH:
Must be provided for: and you shall put
LADY MACBETH:
This night's great business into my dispatch,
LADY MACBETH:
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
LADY MACBETH:
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
MACBETH:
We will speak further.
LADY MACBETH:
Only look up clear,
LADY MACBETH:
To alter favour ever is to fear
LADY MACBETH:
Leave all the rest to me.
LADY MACBETH:
Exeunt
LADY MACBETH:
SCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.
LADY MACBETH:
Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM,  DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and Attendants
DUNCAN:
This castle hath a pleasant seat, the air
DUNCAN:
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
DUNCAN:
Unto our gentle senses.
BANQUO:
This guest of summer,
BANQUO:
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
BANQUO:
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
BANQUO:
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
BANQUO:
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
BANQUO:
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle
BANQUO:
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
BANQUO:
The air is delicate.
BANQUO:
Enter LADY MACBETH
DUNCAN:
See, see, our honour'd hostess!
DUNCAN:
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
DUNCAN:
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
DUNCAN:
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
DUNCAN:
And thank us for your trouble.
LADY MACBETH:
All our service
LADY MACBETH:
In every point twice done and then done double
LADY MACBETH:
Were poor and single business to contend
LADY MACBETH:
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
LADY MACBETH:
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
LADY MACBETH:
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
LADY MACBETH:
We rest your hermits.
DUNCAN:
Where's the thane of Cawdor?
DUNCAN:
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
DUNCAN:
To be his purveyor: but he rides well,
DUNCAN:
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
DUNCAN:
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
DUNCAN:
We are your guest to-night.
LADY MACBETH:
Your servants ever
LADY MACBETH:
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
LADY MACBETH:
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
LADY MACBETH:
Still to return your own.
DUNCAN:
Give me your hand,
DUNCAN:
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
DUNCAN:
And shall continue our graces towards him.
DUNCAN:
By your leave, hostess.
DUNCAN:
Exeunt
DUNCAN:
SCENE VII. Macbeth's castle.
DUNCAN:
Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers  Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH
MACBETH:
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
MACBETH:
It were done quickly: if the assassination
MACBETH:
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
MACBETH:
With his surcease success, that but this blow
MACBETH:
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
MACBETH:
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
MACBETH:
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
MACBETH:
We still have judgment here, that we but teach
MACBETH:
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
MACBETH:
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
MACBETH:
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
MACBETH:
To our own lips. He's here in double trust,
MACBETH:
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
MACBETH:
Strong both against the deed, then, as his host,
MACBETH:
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
MACBETH:
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
MACBETH:
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
MACBETH:
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
MACBETH:
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
MACBETH:
The deep damnation of his taking-off,
MACBETH:
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
MACBETH:
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
MACBETH:
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
MACBETH:
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
MACBETH:
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
MACBETH:
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
MACBETH:
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
MACBETH:
And falls on the other.
MACBETH:
Enter LADY MACBETH
MACBETH:
How now! what news?
LADY MACBETH:
He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?
MACBETH:
Hath he ask'd for me?
LADY MACBETH:
Know you not he has?
MACBETH:
We will proceed no further in this business
MACBETH:
He hath honour'd me of late, and I have bought
MACBETH:
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
MACBETH:
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
MACBETH:
Not cast aside so soon.
LADY MACBETH:
Was the hope drunk
LADY MACBETH:
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
LADY MACBETH:
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
LADY MACBETH:
At what it did so freely? From this time
LADY MACBETH:
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
LADY MACBETH:
To be the same in thine own act and valour
LADY MACBETH:
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
LADY MACBETH:
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
LADY MACBETH:
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
LADY MACBETH:
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
LADY MACBETH:
Like the poor cat i' the adage?
MACBETH:
Prithee, peace
MACBETH:
I dare do all that may become a man,
MACBETH:
Who dares do more is none.
LADY MACBETH:
What beast was't, then,
LADY MACBETH:
That made you break this enterprise to me?
LADY MACBETH:
When you durst do it, then you were a man,
LADY MACBETH:
And, to be more than what you were, you would
LADY MACBETH:
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
LADY MACBETH:
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both
LADY MACBETH:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
LADY MACBETH:
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
LADY MACBETH:
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me
LADY MACBETH:
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
LADY MACBETH:
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
LADY MACBETH:
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
LADY MACBETH:
Have done to this.
MACBETH:
If we should fail?
LADY MACBETH:
We fail!
LADY MACBETH:
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
LADY MACBETH:
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
LADY MACBETH:
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
LADY MACBETH:
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
LADY MACBETH:
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
LADY MACBETH:
That memory, the warder of the brain,
LADY MACBETH:
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
LADY MACBETH:
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
LADY MACBETH:
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
LADY MACBETH:
What cannot you and I perform upon
LADY MACBETH:
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
LADY MACBETH:
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
LADY MACBETH:
Of our great quell?
MACBETH:
Bring forth men-children only,
MACBETH:
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
MACBETH:
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
MACBETH:
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
MACBETH:
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
MACBETH:
That they have done't?
LADY MACBETH:
Who dares receive it other,
LADY MACBETH:
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
LADY MACBETH:
Upon his death?
MACBETH:
I am settled, and bend up
MACBETH:
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
MACBETH:
Away, and mock the time with fairest show
MACBETH:
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
MACBETH:
Exeunt
MACBETH:
ACT II
MACBETH:
SCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.
MACBETH:
Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him
BANQUO:
How goes the night, boy?
FLEANCE:
The moon is down, I have not heard the clock.
BANQUO:
And she goes down at twelve.
FLEANCE:
I take't, 'tis later, sir.
BANQUO:
Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven,
BANQUO:
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
BANQUO:
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
BANQUO:
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
BANQUO:
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
BANQUO:
Gives way to in repose!
BANQUO:
Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch
BANQUO:
Give me my sword.
BANQUO:
Who's there?
MACBETH:
A friend.
BANQUO:
What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed
BANQUO:
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
BANQUO:
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
BANQUO:
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
BANQUO:
By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up
BANQUO:
In measureless content.
MACBETH:
Being unprepared,
MACBETH:
Our will became the servant to defect,
MACBETH:
Which else should free have wrought.
BANQUO:
All's well.
BANQUO:
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters
BANQUO:
To you they have show'd some truth.
MACBETH:
I think not of them
MACBETH:
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
MACBETH:
We would spend it in some words upon that business,
MACBETH:
If you would grant the time.
BANQUO:
At your kind'st leisure.
MACBETH:
If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
MACBETH:
It shall make honour for you.
BANQUO:
So I lose none
BANQUO:
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
BANQUO:
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
BANQUO:
I shall be counsell'd.
MACBETH:
Good repose the while!
BANQUO:
Thanks, sir: the like to you!
BANQUO:
Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE
MACBETH:
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
MACBETH:
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
MACBETH:
Exit Servant
MACBETH:
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
MACBETH:
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
MACBETH:
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
MACBETH:
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
MACBETH:
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
MACBETH:
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
MACBETH:
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
MACBETH:
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
MACBETH:
As this which now I draw.
MACBETH:
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going,
MACBETH:
And such an instrument I was to use.
MACBETH:
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
MACBETH:
Or else worth all the rest, I see thee still,
MACBETH:
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
MACBETH:
Which was not so before. There's no such thing
MACBETH:
It is the bloody business which informs
MACBETH:
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
MACBETH:
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
MACBETH:
The curtain'd sleep, witchcraft celebrates
MACBETH:
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
MACBETH:
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
MACBETH:
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
MACBETH:
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
MACBETH:
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
MACBETH:
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
MACBETH:
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
MACBETH:
And take the present horror from the time,
MACBETH:
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives
MACBETH:
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
MACBETH:
A bell rings
MACBETH:
I go, and it is done, the bell invites me.
MACBETH:
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell
MACBETH:
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
MACBETH:
Exit
MACBETH:
SCENE II. The same.
MACBETH:
Enter LADY MACBETH
LADY MACBETH:
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold,
LADY MACBETH:
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
LADY MACBETH:
Hark! Peace!
LADY MACBETH:
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
LADY MACBETH:
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it
LADY MACBETH:
The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
LADY MACBETH:
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
LADY MACBETH:
their possets,
LADY MACBETH:
That death and nature do contend about them,
LADY MACBETH:
Whether they live or die.
MACBETH:
[Within]  Who's there? what, ho!
LADY MACBETH:
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
LADY MACBETH:
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
LADY MACBETH:
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready,
LADY MACBETH:
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
LADY MACBETH:
My father as he slept, I had done't.
LADY MACBETH:
Enter MACBETH
LADY MACBETH:
My husband!
MACBETH:
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
LADY MACBETH:
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
LADY MACBETH:
Did not you speak?
MACBETH:
When?
LADY MACBETH:
Now.
MACBETH:
As I descended?
LADY MACBETH:
Ay.
MACBETH:
Hark!
MACBETH:
Who lies i' the second chamber?
LADY MACBETH:
Donalbain.
MACBETH:
This is a sorry sight.
MACBETH:
Looking on his hands
LADY MACBETH:
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
MACBETH:
There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
MACBETH:
'Murder!'
MACBETH:
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them
MACBETH:
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
MACBETH:
Again to sleep.
LADY MACBETH:
There are two lodged together.
MACBETH:
One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other,
MACBETH:
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
MACBETH:
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
MACBETH:
When they did say 'God bless us!'
LADY MACBETH:
Consider it not so deeply.
MACBETH:
But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
MACBETH:
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
MACBETH:
Stuck in my throat.
LADY MACBETH:
These deeds must not be thought
LADY MACBETH:
After these ways, so, it will make us mad.
MACBETH:
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
MACBETH:
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
MACBETH:
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
MACBETH:
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
MACBETH:
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
MACBETH:
Chief nourisher in life's feast,--
LADY MACBETH:
What do you mean?
MACBETH:
Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house
MACBETH:
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
MACBETH:
Shall sleep no more, Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
LADY MACBETH:
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
LADY MACBETH:
You do unbend your noble strength, to think
LADY MACBETH:
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
LADY MACBETH:
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
LADY MACBETH:
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
LADY MACBETH:
They must lie there: go carry them, and smear
LADY MACBETH:
The sleepy grooms with blood.
MACBETH:
I'll go no more
MACBETH:
I am afraid to think what I have done,
MACBETH:
Look on't again I dare not.
LADY MACBETH:
Infirm of purpose!
LADY MACBETH:
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
LADY MACBETH:
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
LADY MACBETH:
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
LADY MACBETH:
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
LADY MACBETH:
For it must seem their guilt.
LADY MACBETH:
Exit. Knocking within
MACBETH:
Whence is that knocking?
MACBETH:
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
MACBETH:
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
MACBETH:
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
MACBETH:
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
MACBETH:
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
MACBETH:
Making the green one red.
MACBETH:
Re-enter LADY MACBETH
LADY MACBETH:
My hands are of your colour, but I shame
LADY MACBETH:
To wear a heart so white.
LADY MACBETH:
Knocking within
LADY MACBETH:
I hear a knocking
LADY MACBETH:
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber,
LADY MACBETH:
A little water clears us of this deed
LADY MACBETH:
How easy is it, then! Your constancy
LADY MACBETH:
Hath left you unattended.
LADY MACBETH:
Knocking within
LADY MACBETH:
Hark! more knocking.
LADY MACBETH:
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
LADY MACBETH:
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
LADY MACBETH:
So poorly in your thoughts.
MACBETH:
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
MACBETH:
Knocking within
MACBETH:
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
MACBETH:
Exeunt
MACBETH:
SCENE III. The same.
MACBETH:
Knocking within. Enter a Porter
Porter:
Here's a knocking indeed! If a
Porter:
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
Porter:
old turning the key.
Porter:
Knocking within
Porter:
Knock,
Porter:
knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
Porter:
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
Porter:
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
Porter:
time, have napkins enow about you, here
Porter:
you'll sweat for't.
Porter:
Knocking within
Porter:
Knock,
Porter:
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
Porter:
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
Porter:
swear in both the scales against either scale,
Porter:
who committed treason enough for God's sake,
Porter:
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
Porter:
in, equivocator.
Porter:
Knocking within
Porter:
Knock,
Porter:
knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
Porter:
English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
Porter:
a French hose: come in, tailor, here you may
Porter:
roast your goose.
Porter:
Knocking within
Porter:
Knock,
Porter:
knock, never at quiet! What are you? But
Porter:
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
Porter:
it no further: I had thought to have let in
Porter:
some of all professions that go the primrose
Porter:
way to the everlasting bonfire.
Porter:
Knocking within
Porter:
Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.
Porter:
Opens the gate
Porter:
Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX
MACDUFF:
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
MACDUFF:
That you do lie so late?
Porter:
'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
Porter:
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
Porter:
provoker of three things.
MACDUFF:
What three things does drink especially provoke?
Porter:
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
Porter:
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes,
Porter:
it provokes the desire, but it takes
Porter:
away the performance: therefore, much drink
Porter:
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery
Porter:
it makes him, and it mars him, it sets
Porter:
him on, and it takes him off, it persuades him,
Porter:
and disheartens him, makes him stand to, and
Porter:
not stand to, in conclusion, equivocates him
Porter:
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
MACDUFF:
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
Porter:
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
Porter:
me: but I requited him for his lie, and, I
Porter:
think, being too strong for him, though he took
Porter:
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
Porter:
him.
MACDUFF:
Is thy master stirring?
MACDUFF:
Enter MACBETH
MACDUFF:
Our knocking has awaked him, here he comes.
LENNOX:
Good morrow, noble sir.
MACBETH:
Good morrow, both.
MACDUFF:
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
MACBETH:
Not yet.
MACDUFF:
He did command me to call timely on him
MACDUFF:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.
MACBETH:
I'll bring you to him.
MACDUFF:
I know this is a joyful trouble to you,
MACDUFF:
But yet 'tis one.
MACBETH:
The labour we delight in physics pain.
MACBETH:
This is the door.
MACDUFF:
I'll make so bold to call,
MACDUFF:
For 'tis my limited service.
MACDUFF:
Exit
LENNOX:
Goes the king hence to-day?
MACBETH:
He does: he did appoint so.
LENNOX:
The night has been unruly: where we lay,
LENNOX:
Our chimneys were blown down, and, as they say,
LENNOX:
Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death,
LENNOX:
And prophesying with accents terrible
LENNOX:
Of dire combustion and confused events
LENNOX:
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
LENNOX:
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
LENNOX:
Was feverous and did shake.
MACBETH:
'Twas a rough night.
LENNOX:
My young remembrance cannot parallel
LENNOX:
A fellow to it.
LENNOX:
Re-enter MACDUFF
MACDUFF:
O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
MACDUFF:
Cannot conceive nor name thee!
LENNOX:
What's the matter.
MACDUFF:
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
MACDUFF:
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
MACDUFF:
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
MACDUFF:
The life o' the building!
MACBETH:
What is 't you say? the life?
LENNOX:
Mean you his majesty?
MACDUFF:
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
MACDUFF:
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak,
MACDUFF:
See, and then speak yourselves.
MACDUFF:
Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX
MACDUFF:
Awake, awake!
MACDUFF:
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
MACDUFF:
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
MACDUFF:
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
MACDUFF:
And look on death itself! up, up, and see
MACDUFF:
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
MACDUFF:
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
MACDUFF:
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
MACDUFF:
Bell rings
MACDUFF:
Enter LADY MACBETH
LADY MACBETH:
What's the business,
LADY MACBETH:
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
LADY MACBETH:
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!
MACDUFF:
O gentle lady,
MACDUFF:
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak
MACDUFF:
The repetition, in a woman's ear,
MACDUFF:
Would murder as it fell.
MACDUFF:
Enter BANQUO
MACDUFF:
O Banquo, Banquo,
MACDUFF:
Our royal master 's murder'd!
LADY MACBETH:
Woe, alas!
LADY MACBETH:
What, in our house?
BANQUO:
Too cruel any where.
BANQUO:
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
BANQUO:
And say it is not so.
BANQUO:
Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS
MACBETH:
Had I but died an hour before this chance,
MACBETH:
I had lived a blessed time, for, from this instant,
MACBETH:
There 's nothing serious in mortality
MACBETH:
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead,
MACBETH:
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
MACBETH:
Is left this vault to brag of.
MACBETH:
Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN
DONALBAIN:
What is amiss?
MACBETH:
You are, and do not know't
MACBETH:
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
MACBETH:
Is stopp'd, the very source of it is stopp'd.
MACDUFF:
Your royal father 's murder'd.
MALCOLM:
O, by whom?
LENNOX:
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't
LENNOX:
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood,
LENNOX:
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
LENNOX:
Upon their pillows
LENNOX:
They stared, and were distracted, no man's life
LENNOX:
Was to be trusted with them.
MACBETH:
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
MACBETH:
That I did kill them.
MACDUFF:
Wherefore did you so?
MACBETH:
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
MACBETH:
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man
MACBETH:
The expedition my violent love
MACBETH:
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
MACBETH:
His silver skin laced with his golden blood,
MACBETH:
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
MACBETH:
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
MACBETH:
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
MACBETH:
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
MACBETH:
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
MACBETH:
Courage to make 's love kno wn?
LADY MACBETH:
Help me hence, ho!
MACDUFF:
Look to the lady.
MALCOLM:
[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues,
MALCOLM:
That most may claim this argument for ours?
DONALBAIN:
[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here,
DONALBAIN:
where our fate,
DONALBAIN:
Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
DONALBAIN:
Let 's away,
DONALBAIN:
Our tears are not yet brew'd.
MALCOLM:
[Aside to DONALBAIN]        Nor our strong sorrow
MALCOLM:
Upon the foot of motion.
BANQUO:
Look to the lady
BANQUO:
LADY MACBETH is carried out
BANQUO:
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
BANQUO:
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
BANQUO:
And question this most bloody piece of work,
BANQUO:
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us
BANQUO:
In the great hand of God I stand, and thence
BANQUO:
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
BANQUO:
Of treasonous malice.
MACDUFF:
And so do I.
ALL:
So all.
MACBETH:
Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
MACBETH:
And meet i' the hall together.
ALL:
Well contented.
ALL:
Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.
MALCOLM:
What will you do? Let's not consort with them
MALCOLM:
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
MALCOLM:
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
DONALBAIN:
To Ireland, I, our separated fortune
DONALBAIN:
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
DONALBAIN:
There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
DONALBAIN:
The nearer bloody.
MALCOLM:
This murderous shaft that's shot
MALCOLM:
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
MALCOLM:
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse,
MALCOLM:
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
MALCOLM:
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
MALCOLM:
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.
MALCOLM:
Exeunt
MALCOLM:
SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.
MALCOLM:
Enter ROSS and an old Man
Old Man:
Threescore and ten I can remember well
Old Man:
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Old Man:
Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night
Old Man:
Hath trifled former knowings.
ROSS:
Ah, good father,
ROSS:
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
ROSS:
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
ROSS:
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp
ROSS:
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
ROSS:
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
ROSS:
When living light should kiss it?
Old Man:
'Tis unnatural,
Old Man:
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
Old Man:
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
Old Man:
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
ROSS:
And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
ROSS:
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
ROSS:
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
ROSS:
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
ROSS:
War with mankind.
Old Man:
'Tis said they eat each other.
ROSS:
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
ROSS:
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
ROSS:
Enter MACDUFF
ROSS:
How goes the world, sir, now?
MACDUFF:
Why, see you not?
ROSS:
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
MACDUFF:
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
ROSS:
Alas, the day!
ROSS:
What good could they pretend?
MACDUFF:
They were suborn'd
MACDUFF:
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
MACDUFF:
Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them
MACDUFF:
Suspicion of the deed.
ROSS:
'Gainst nature still!
ROSS:
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
ROSS:
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
ROSS:
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
MACDUFF:
He is already named, and gone to Scone
MACDUFF:
To be invested.
ROSS:
Where is Duncan's body?
MACDUFF:
Carried to Colmekill,
MACDUFF:
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
MACDUFF:
And guardian of their bones.
ROSS:
Will you to Scone?
MACDUFF:
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
ROSS:
Well, I will thither.
MACDUFF:
Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
MACDUFF:
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
ROSS:
Farewell, father.
Old Man:
God's benison go with you, and with those
Old Man:
That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!
Old Man:
Exeunt
Old Man:
ACT III
Old Man:
SCENE I. Forres. The palace.
Old Man:
Enter BANQUO
BANQUO:
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
BANQUO:
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
BANQUO:
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
BANQUO:
It should not stand in thy posterity,
BANQUO:
But that myself should be the root and father
BANQUO:
Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
BANQUO:
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
BANQUO:
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
BANQUO:
May they not be my oracles as well,
BANQUO:
And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.
BANQUO:
Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY  MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants
MACBETH:
Here's our chief guest.
LADY MACBETH:
If he had been forgotten,
LADY MACBETH:
It had been as a gap in our great feast,
LADY MACBETH:
And all-thing unbecoming.
MACBETH:
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
MACBETH:
And I'll request your presence.
BANQUO:
Let your highness
BANQUO:
Command upon me, to the which my duties
BANQUO:
Are with a most indissoluble tie
BANQUO:
For ever knit.
MACBETH:
Ride you this afternoon?
BANQUO:
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH:
We should have else desired your good advice,
MACBETH:
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
MACBETH:
In this day's council, but we'll take to-morrow.
MACBETH:
Is't far you ride?
BANQUO:
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
BANQUO:
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
BANQUO:
I must become a borrower of the night
BANQUO:
For a dark hour or twain.
MACBETH:
Fail not our feast.
BANQUO:
My lord, I will not.
MACBETH:
We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
MACBETH:
In England and in Ireland, not confessing
MACBETH:
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
MACBETH:
With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
MACBETH:
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
MACBETH:
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
MACBETH:
Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?
BANQUO:
Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.
MACBETH:
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,
MACBETH:
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.
MACBETH:
Exit BANQUO
MACBETH:
Let every man be master of his time
MACBETH:
Till seven at night: to make society
MACBETH:
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
MACBETH:
Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!
MACBETH:
Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant
MACBETH:
Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
MACBETH:
Our pleasure?
ATTENDANT:
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
MACBETH:
Bring them before us.
MACBETH:
Exit Attendant
MACBETH:
To be thus is nothing,
MACBETH:
But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
MACBETH:
Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
MACBETH:
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares,
MACBETH:
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
MACBETH:
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
MACBETH:
To act in safety. There is none but he
MACBETH:
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
MACBETH:
My Genius is rebuked, as, it is said,
MACBETH:
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
MACBETH:
When first they put the name of king upon me,
MACBETH:
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
MACBETH:
They hail'd him father to a line of kings
MACBETH:
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
MACBETH:
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
MACBETH:
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
MACBETH:
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
MACBETH:
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
MACBETH:
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd,
MACBETH:
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
MACBETH:
Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
MACBETH:
Given to the common enemy of man,
MACBETH:
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
MACBETH:
Rather than so, come fate into the list.
MACBETH:
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!
MACBETH:
Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers
MACBETH:
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
MACBETH:
Exit Attendant
MACBETH:
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
First Murderer:
It was, so please your highness.
MACBETH:
Well then, now
MACBETH:
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
MACBETH:
That it was he in the times past which held you
MACBETH:
So under fortune, which you thought had been
MACBETH:
Our innocent self: this I made good to you
MACBETH:
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
MACBETH:
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
MACBETH:
the instruments,
MACBETH:
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
MACBETH:
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
MACBETH:
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'
First Murderer:
You made it known to us.
MACBETH:
I did so, and went further, which is now
MACBETH:
Our point of second meeting. Do you find
MACBETH:
Your patience so predominant in your nature
MACBETH:
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
MACBETH:
To pray for this good man and for his issue,
MACBETH:
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
MACBETH:
And beggar'd yours for ever?
First Murderer:
We are men, my liege.
MACBETH:
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,
MACBETH:
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
MACBETH:
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
MACBETH:
All by the name of dogs: the valued file
MACBETH:
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
MACBETH:
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
MACBETH:
According to the gift which bounteous nature
MACBETH:
Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive
MACBETH:
Particular addition. from the bill
MACBETH:
That writes them all alike: and so of men.
MACBETH:
Now, if you have a station in the file,
MACBETH:
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't,
MACBETH:
And I will put that business in your bosoms,
MACBETH:
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
MACBETH:
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
MACBETH:
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
MACBETH:
Which in his death were perfect.
Second Murderer:
I am one, my liege,
Second Murderer:
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Second Murderer:
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
Second Murderer:
I do to spite the world.
First Murderer:
And I another
First Murderer:
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
First Murderer:
That I would set my lie on any chance,
First Murderer:
To mend it, or be rid on't.
MACBETH:
Both of you
MACBETH:
Know Banquo was your enemy.
Both Murderers:
True, my lord.
MACBETH:
So is he mine, and in such bloody distance,
MACBETH:
That every minute of his being thrusts
MACBETH:
Against my near'st of life: and though I could
MACBETH:
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
MACBETH:
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
MACBETH:
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
MACBETH:
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
MACBETH:
Who I myself struck down, and thence it is,
MACBETH:
That I to your assistance do make love,
MACBETH:
Masking the business from the common eye
MACBETH:
For sundry weighty reasons.
Second Murderer:
We shall, my lord,
Second Murderer:
Perform what you command us.
First Murderer:
Though our lives--
MACBETH:
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
MACBETH:
I will advise you where to plant yourselves,
MACBETH:
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
MACBETH:
The moment on't, for't must be done to-night,
MACBETH:
And something from the palace, always thought
MACBETH:
That I require a clearness: and with him--
MACBETH:
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
MACBETH:
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
MACBETH:
Whose absence is no less material to me
MACBETH:
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
MACBETH:
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart
MACBETH:
I'll come to you anon.
Both Murderers:
We are resolved, my lord.
MACBETH:
I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
MACBETH:
Exeunt Murderers
MACBETH:
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
MACBETH:
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.
MACBETH:
Exit
MACBETH:
SCENE II. The palace.
MACBETH:
Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant
LADY MACBETH:
Is Banquo gone from court?
Servant:
Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.
LADY MACBETH:
Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
LADY MACBETH:
For a few words.
Servant:
Madam, I will.
Servant:
Exit
LADY MACBETH:
Nought's had, all's spent,
LADY MACBETH:
Where our desire is got without content
LADY MACBETH:
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
LADY MACBETH:
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
LADY MACBETH:
Enter MACBETH
LADY MACBETH:
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
LADY MACBETH:
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
LADY MACBETH:
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
LADY MACBETH:
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
LADY MACBETH:
Should be without regard: what's done is done.
MACBETH:
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it
MACBETH:
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
MACBETH:
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
MACBETH:
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
MACBETH:
worlds suffer,
MACBETH:
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
MACBETH:
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
MACBETH:
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
MACBETH:
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
MACBETH:
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
MACBETH:
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave,
MACBETH:
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well,
MACBETH:
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
MACBETH:
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
MACBETH:
Can touch him further.
LADY MACBETH:
Come on,
LADY MACBETH:
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks,
LADY MACBETH:
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
MACBETH:
So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you
MACBETH:
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo,
MACBETH:
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue
MACBETH:
Unsafe the while, that we
MACBETH:
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
MACBETH:
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
MACBETH:
Disguising what they are.
LADY MACBETH:
You must leave this.
MACBETH:
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
MACBETH:
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
LADY MACBETH:
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
MACBETH:
There's comfort yet, they are assailable,
MACBETH:
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
MACBETH:
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
MACBETH:
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
MACBETH:
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
MACBETH:
A deed of dreadful note.
LADY MACBETH:
What's to be done?
MACBETH:
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
MACBETH:
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
MACBETH:
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,
MACBETH:
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
MACBETH:
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
MACBETH:
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow
MACBETH:
Makes wing to the rooky wood
MACBETH:
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,
MACBETH:
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
MACBETH:
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still,
MACBETH:
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
MACBETH:
So, prithee, go with me.
MACBETH:
Exeunt
MACBETH:
SCENE III. A park near the palace.
MACBETH:
Enter three Murderers
First Murderer:
But who did bid thee join with us?
Third Murderer:
Macbeth.
Second Murderer:
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Second Murderer:
Our offices and what we have to do
Second Murderer:
To the direction just.
First Murderer:
Then stand with us.
First Murderer:
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day
First Murderer:
Now spurs the lated traveller apace
First Murderer:
To gain the timely inn, and near approaches
First Murderer:
The subject of our watch.
Third Murderer:
Hark! I hear horses.
BANQUO:
[Within]  Give us a light there, ho!
Second Murderer:
Then 'tis he: the rest
Second Murderer:
That are within the note of expectation
Second Murderer:
Already are i' the court.
First Murderer:
His horses go about.
Third Murderer:
Almost a mile: but he does usually,
Third Murderer:
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
Third Murderer:
Make it their walk.
Second Murderer:
A light, a light!
Second Murderer:
Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch
Third Murderer:
'Tis he.
First Murderer:
Stand to't.
BANQUO:
It will be rain to-night.
First Murderer:
Let it come down.
First Murderer:
They set upon BANQUO
BANQUO:
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
BANQUO:
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
BANQUO:
Dies. FLEANCE escapes
Third Murderer:
Who did strike out the light?
First Murderer:
Wast not the way?
Third Murderer:
There's but one down, the son is fled.
Second Murderer:
We have lost
Second Murderer:
Best half of our affair.
First Murderer:
Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
First Murderer:
Exeunt
First Murderer:
SCENE IV. The same. Hall in the palace.
First Murderer:
A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants
MACBETH:
You know your own degrees, sit down: at first
MACBETH:
And last the hearty welcome.
Lords:
Thanks to your majesty.
MACBETH:
Ourself will mingle with society,
MACBETH:
And play the humble host.
MACBETH:
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
MACBETH:
We will require her welcome.
LADY MACBETH:
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,
LADY MACBETH:
For my heart speaks they are welcome.
LADY MACBETH:
First Murderer appears at the door
MACBETH:
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
MACBETH:
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst
MACBETH:
Be large in mirth, anon we'll drink a measure
MACBETH:
The table round.
MACBETH:
Approaching the door
MACBETH:
There's blood on thy face.
First Murderer:
'Tis Banquo's then.
MACBETH:
'Tis better thee without than he within.
MACBETH:
Is he dispatch'd?
First Murderer:
My lord, his throat is cut, that I did for him.
MACBETH:
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
MACBETH:
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
MACBETH:
Thou art the nonpareil.
First Murderer:
Most royal sir,
First Murderer:
Fleance is 'scaped.
MACBETH:
Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
MACBETH:
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
MACBETH:
As broad and general as the casing air
MACBETH:
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
MACBETH:
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?
First Murderer:
Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
First Murderer:
With twenty trenched gashes on his head,
First Murderer:
The least a death to nature.
MACBETH:
Thanks for that
MACBETH:
There the grown serpent lies, the worm that's fled
MACBETH:
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
MACBETH:
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
MACBETH:
We'll hear, ourselves, again.
MACBETH:
Exit Murderer
LADY MACBETH:
My royal lord,
LADY MACBETH:
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
LADY MACBETH:
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
LADY MACBETH:
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home,
LADY MACBETH:
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony,
LADY MACBETH:
Meeting were bare without it.
MACBETH:
Sweet remembrancer!
MACBETH:
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
MACBETH:
And health on both!
LENNOX:
May't please your highness sit.
LENNOX:
The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place
MACBETH:
Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
MACBETH:
Were the graced person of our Banquo present,
MACBETH:
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
MACBETH:
Than pity for mischance!
ROSS:
His absence, sir,
ROSS:
Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
ROSS:
To grace us with your royal company.
MACBETH:
The table's full.
LENNOX:
Here is a place reserved, sir.
MACBETH:
Where?
LENNOX:
Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?
MACBETH:
Which of you have done this?
Lords:
What, my good lord?
MACBETH:
Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
MACBETH:
Thy gory locks at me.
ROSS:
Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.
LADY MACBETH:
Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
LADY MACBETH:
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat,
LADY MACBETH:
The fit is momentary, upon a thought
LADY MACBETH:
He will again be well: if much you note him,
LADY MACBETH:
You shall offend him and extend his passion
LADY MACBETH:
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
MACBETH:
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
MACBETH:
Which might appal the devil.
LADY MACBETH:
O proper stuff!
LADY MACBETH:
This is the very painting of your fear
LADY MACBETH:
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
LADY MACBETH:
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
LADY MACBETH:
Impostors to true fear, would well become
LADY MACBETH:
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
LADY MACBETH:
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
LADY MACBETH:
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
LADY MACBETH:
You look but on a stool.
MACBETH:
Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
MACBETH:
how say you?
MACBETH:
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
MACBETH:
If charnel-houses and our graves must send
MACBETH:
Those that we bury back, our monuments
MACBETH:
Shall be the maws of kites.
MACBETH:
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
LADY MACBETH:
What, quite unmann'd in folly?
MACBETH:
If I stand here, I saw him.
LADY MACBETH:
Fie, for shame!
MACBETH:
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
MACBETH:
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal,
MACBETH:
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
MACBETH:
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
MACBETH:
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
MACBETH:
And there an end, but now they rise again,
MACBETH:
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
MACBETH:
And push us from our stools: this is more strange
MACBETH:
Than such a murder is.
LADY MACBETH:
My worthy lord,
LADY MACBETH:
Your noble friends do lack you.
MACBETH:
I do forget.
MACBETH:
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
MACBETH:
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
MACBETH:
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all,
MACBETH:
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine, fill full.
MACBETH:
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
MACBETH:
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss,
MACBETH:
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
MACBETH:
And all to all.
Lords:
Our duties, and the pledge.
Lords:
Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO
MACBETH:
Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
MACBETH:
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold,
MACBETH:
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
MACBETH:
Which thou dost glare with!
LADY MACBETH:
Think of this, good peers,
LADY MACBETH:
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other,
LADY MACBETH:
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
MACBETH:
What man dare, I dare
MACBETH:
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
MACBETH:
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger,
MACBETH:
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
MACBETH:
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
MACBETH:
And dare me to the desert with thy sword,
MACBETH:
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
MACBETH:
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
MACBETH:
Unreal mockery, hence!
MACBETH:
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
MACBETH:
Why, so: being gone,
MACBETH:
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.
LADY MACBETH:
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
LADY MACBETH:
With most admired disorder.
MACBETH:
Can such things be,
MACBETH:
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
MACBETH:
Without our special wonder? You make me strange
MACBETH:
Even to the disposition that I owe,
MACBETH:
When now I think you can behold such sights,
MACBETH:
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
MACBETH:
When mine is blanched with fear.
ROSS:
What sights, my lord?
LADY MACBETH:
I pray you, speak not, he grows worse and worse,
LADY MACBETH:
Question enrages him. At once, good night
LADY MACBETH:
Stand not upon the order of your going,
LADY MACBETH:
But go at once.
LENNOX:
Good night, and better health
LENNOX:
Attend his majesty!
LADY MACBETH:
A kind good night to all!
LADY MACBETH:
Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH
MACBETH:
It will have blood, they say, blood will have blood
MACBETH:
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak,
MACBETH:
Augurs and understood relations have
MACBETH:
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
MACBETH:
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?
LADY MACBETH:
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
MACBETH:
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
MACBETH:
At our great bidding?
LADY MACBETH:
Did you send to him, sir?
MACBETH:
I hear it by the way, but I will send
MACBETH:
There's not a one of them but in his house
MACBETH:
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
MACBETH:
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters
MACBETH:
More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know,
MACBETH:
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
MACBETH:
All causes shall give way: I am in blood
MACBETH:
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
MACBETH:
Returning were as tedious as go o'er
MACBETH:
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
MACBETH:
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.
LADY MACBETH:
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
MACBETH:
Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
MACBETH:
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use
MACBETH:
We are yet but young in deed.
MACBETH:
Exeunt
MACBETH:
SCENE V. A Heath.
MACBETH:
Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE
First Witch:
Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.
HECATE:
Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
HECATE:
Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
HECATE:
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
HECATE:
In riddles and affairs of death,
HECATE:
And I, the mistress of your charms,
HECATE:
The close contriver of all harms,
HECATE:
Was never call'd to bear my part,
HECATE:
Or show the glory of our art?
HECATE:
And, which is worse, all you have done
HECATE:
Hath been but for a wayward son,
HECATE:
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
HECATE:
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
HECATE:
But make amends now: get you gone,
HECATE:
And at the pit of Acheron
HECATE:
Meet me i' the morning: thither he
HECATE:
Will come to know his destiny
HECATE:
Your vessels and your spells provide,
HECATE:
Your charms and every thing beside.
HECATE:
I am for the air, this night I'll spend
HECATE:
Unto a dismal and a fatal end
HECATE:
Great business must be wrought ere noon
HECATE:
Upon the corner of the moon
HECATE:
There hangs a vaporous drop profound,
HECATE:
I'll catch it ere it come to ground
HECATE:
And that distill'd by magic sleights
HECATE:
Shall raise such artificial sprites
HECATE:
As by the strength of their illusion
HECATE:
Shall draw him on to his confusion
HECATE:
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
HECATE:
He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear
HECATE:
And you all know, security
HECATE:
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
HECATE:
Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,'  and c
HECATE:
Hark! I am call'd, my little spirit, see,
HECATE:
Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.
HECATE:
Exit
First Witch:
Come, let's make haste, she'll soon be back again.
First Witch:
Exeunt
First Witch:
SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.
First Witch:
Enter LENNOX and another Lord
LENNOX:
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
LENNOX:
Which can interpret further: only, I say,
LENNOX:
Things have been strangely borne. The
LENNOX:
gracious Duncan
LENNOX:
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead
LENNOX:
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
LENNOX:
Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
LENNOX:
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
LENNOX:
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
LENNOX:
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
LENNOX:
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
LENNOX:
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
LENNOX:
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
LENNOX:
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
LENNOX:
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too,
LENNOX:
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
LENNOX:
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
LENNOX:
He has borne all things well: and I do think
LENNOX:
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
LENNOX:
As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
LENNOX:
should find
LENNOX:
What 'twere to kill a father, so should Fleance.
LENNOX:
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
LENNOX:
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
LENNOX:
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
LENNOX:
Where he bestows himself?
Lord:
The son of Duncan,
Lord:
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
Lord:
Lives in the English court, and is received
Lord:
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
Lord:
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Lord:
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
Lord:
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
Lord:
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
Lord:
That, by the help of these--with Him above
Lord:
To ratify the work--we may again
Lord:
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
Lord:
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Lord:
Do faithful homage and receive free honours
Lord:
All which we pine for now: and this report
Lord:
Hath so exasperate the king that he
Lord:
Prepares for some attempt of war.
LENNOX:
Sent he to Macduff?
Lord:
He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
Lord:
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
Lord:
And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
Lord:
That clogs me with this answer.'
LENNOX:
And that well might
LENNOX:
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
LENNOX:
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
LENNOX:
Fly to the court of England and unfold
LENNOX:
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
LENNOX:
May soon return to this our suffering country
LENNOX:
Under a hand accursed!
Lord:
I'll send my prayers with him.
Lord:
Exeunt
Lord:
ACT IV
Lord:
SCENE I. A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron.
Lord:
Thunder. Enter the three Witches
First Witch:
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
Second Witch:
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
Third Witch:
Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.
First Witch:
Round about the cauldron go,
First Witch:
In the poison'd entrails throw.
First Witch:
Toad, that under cold stone
First Witch:
Days and nights has thirty-one
First Witch:
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
First Witch:
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.
ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble,
ALL:
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
Second Witch:
Fillet of a fenny snake,
Second Witch:
In the cauldron boil and bake,
Second Witch:
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Second Witch:
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Second Witch:
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
Second Witch:
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
Second Witch:
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Second Witch:
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble,
ALL:
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Third Witch:
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Third Witch:
Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
Third Witch:
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
Third Witch:
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
Third Witch:
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Third Witch:
Gall of goat, and slips of yew
Third Witch:
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
Third Witch:
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
Third Witch:
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Third Witch:
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
Third Witch:
Make the gruel thick and slab
Third Witch:
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
Third Witch:
For the ingredients of our cauldron.
ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble,
ALL:
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Second Witch:
Cool it with a baboon's blood,
Second Witch:
Then the charm is firm and good.
Second Witch:
Enter HECATE to the other three Witches
HECATE:
O well done! I commend your pains,
HECATE:
And every one shall share i' the gains,
HECATE:
And now about the cauldron sing,
HECATE:
Live elves and fairies in a ring,
HECATE:
Enchanting all that you put in.
HECATE:
Music and a song: 'Black spirits,'  and c
HECATE:
HECATE retires
Second Witch:
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Second Witch:
Something wicked this way comes.
Second Witch:
Open, locks,
Second Witch:
Whoever knocks!
Second Witch:
Enter MACBETH
MACBETH:
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
MACBETH:
What is't you do?
ALL:
A deed without a name.
MACBETH:
I conjure you, by that which you profess,
MACBETH:
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me
MACBETH:
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
MACBETH:
Against the churches, though the yesty waves
MACBETH:
Confound and swallow navigation up,
MACBETH:
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down,
MACBETH:
Though castles topple on their warders' heads,
MACBETH:
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
MACBETH:
Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure
MACBETH:
Of nature's germens tumble all together,
MACBETH:
Even till destruction sicken, answer me
MACBETH:
To what I ask you.
First Witch:
Speak.
Second Witch:
Demand.
Third Witch:
We'll answer.
First Witch:
Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
First Witch:
Or from our masters?
MACBETH:
Call 'em, let me see 'em.
First Witch:
Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
First Witch:
Her nine farrow, grease that's sweaten
First Witch:
From the murderer's gibbet throw
First Witch:
Into the flame.
ALL:
Come, high or low,
ALL:
Thyself and office deftly show!
ALL:
Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head
MACBETH:
Tell me, thou unknown power,--
First Witch:
He knows thy thought
First Witch:
Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
First Apparition:
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff,
First Apparition:
Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
First Apparition:
Descends
MACBETH:
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks,
MACBETH:
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
MACBETH:
word more,--
First Witch:
He will not be commanded: here's another,
First Witch:
More potent than the first.
First Witch:
Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child
Second Apparition:
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
MACBETH:
Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.
Second Apparition:
Be bloody, bold, and resolute, laugh to scorn
Second Apparition:
The power of man, for none of woman born
Second Apparition:
Shall harm Macbeth.
Second Apparition:
Descends
MACBETH:
Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
MACBETH:
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
MACBETH:
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live,
MACBETH:
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
MACBETH:
And sleep in spite of thunder.
MACBETH:
Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand
MACBETH:
What is this
MACBETH:
That rises like the issue of a king,
MACBETH:
And wears upon his baby-brow the round
MACBETH:
And top of sovereignty?
ALL:
Listen, but speak not to't.
Third Apparition:
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care
Third Apparition:
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are
Third Apparition:
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
Third Apparition:
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
Third Apparition:
Shall come against him.
Third Apparition:
Descends
MACBETH:
That will never be
MACBETH:
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
MACBETH:
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
MACBETH:
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
MACBETH:
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
MACBETH:
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
MACBETH:
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
MACBETH:
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
MACBETH:
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
MACBETH:
Reign in this kingdom?
ALL:
Seek to know no more.
MACBETH:
I will be satisfied: deny me this,
MACBETH:
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
MACBETH:
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
MACBETH:
Hautboys
First Witch:
Show!
Second Witch:
Show!
Third Witch:
Show!
ALL:
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart,
ALL:
Come like shadows, so depart!
ALL:
A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand, GHOST OF BANQUO following
MACBETH:
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
MACBETH:
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
MACBETH:
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
MACBETH:
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
MACBETH:
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
MACBETH:
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
MACBETH:
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more
MACBETH:
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
MACBETH:
Which shows me many more, and some I see
MACBETH:
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry
MACBETH:
Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true,
MACBETH:
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
MACBETH:
And points at them for his.
MACBETH:
Apparitions vanish
MACBETH:
What, is this so?
First Witch:
Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
First Witch:
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
First Witch:
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
First Witch:
And show the best of our delights
First Witch:
I'll charm the air to give a sound,
First Witch:
While you perform your antic round
First Witch:
That this great king may kindly say,
First Witch:
Our duties did his welcome pay.
First Witch:
Music. The witches dance and then vanish, with HECATE
MACBETH:
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
MACBETH:
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
MACBETH:
Come in, without there!
MACBETH:
Enter LENNOX
LENNOX:
What's your grace's will?
MACBETH:
Saw you the weird sisters?
LENNOX:
No, my lord.
MACBETH:
Came they not by you?
LENNOX:
No, indeed, my lord.
MACBETH:
Infected be the air whereon they ride,
MACBETH:
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
MACBETH:
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
LENNOX:
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
LENNOX:
Macduff is fled to England.
MACBETH:
Fled to England!
LENNOX:
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH:
Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits
MACBETH:
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
MACBETH:
Unless the deed go with it, from this moment
MACBETH:
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
MACBETH:
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
MACBETH:
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done
MACBETH:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
MACBETH:
Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword
MACBETH:
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
MACBETH:
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool,
MACBETH:
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
MACBETH:
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
MACBETH:
Come, bring me where they are.
MACBETH:
Exeunt
MACBETH:
SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.
MACBETH:
Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS
LADY MACDUFF:
What had he done, to make him fly the land?
ROSS:
You must have patience, madam.
LADY MACDUFF:
He had none
LADY MACDUFF:
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
LADY MACDUFF:
Our fears do make us traitors.
ROSS:
You know not
ROSS:
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
LADY MACDUFF:
Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
LADY MACDUFF:
His mansion and his titles in a place
LADY MACDUFF:
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not,
LADY MACDUFF:
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
LADY MACDUFF:
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
LADY MACDUFF:
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
LADY MACDUFF:
All is the fear and nothing is the love,
LADY MACDUFF:
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
LADY MACDUFF:
So runs against all reason.
ROSS:
My dearest coz,
ROSS:
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
ROSS:
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
ROSS:
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
ROSS:
much further,
ROSS:
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
ROSS:
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
ROSS:
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
ROSS:
But float upon a wild and violent sea
ROSS:
Each way and move. I take my leave of you
ROSS:
Shall not be long but I'll be here again
ROSS:
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
ROSS:
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
ROSS:
Blessing upon you!
LADY MACDUFF:
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
ROSS:
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
ROSS:
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort
ROSS:
I take my leave at once.
ROSS:
Exit
LADY MACDUFF:
Sirrah, your father's dead,
LADY MACDUFF:
And what will you do now? How will you live?
Son:
As birds do, mother.
LADY MACDUFF:
What, with worms and flies?
Son:
With what I get, I mean, and so do they.
LADY MACDUFF:
Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
LADY MACDUFF:
The pitfall nor the gin.
Son:
Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
Son:
My father is not dead, for all your saying.
LADY MACDUFF:
Yes, he is dead, how wilt thou do for a father?
Son:
Nay, how will you do for a husband?
LADY MACDUFF:
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
Son:
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
LADY MACDUFF:
Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
LADY MACDUFF:
With wit enough for thee.
Son:
Was my father a traitor, mother?
LADY MACDUFF:
Ay, that he was.
Son:
What is a traitor?
LADY MACDUFF:
Why, one that swears and lies.
Son:
And be all traitors that do so?
LADY MACDUFF:
Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.
Son:
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
LADY MACDUFF:
Every one.
Son:
Who must hang them?
LADY MACDUFF:
Why,  the honest men.
Son:
Then the liars and swearers are fools,
Son:
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
Son:
the honest men and hang up them.
LADY MACDUFF:
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
LADY MACDUFF:
But how wilt thou do for a father?
Son:
If he were dead, you'ld weep for
Son:
him: if you would not, it were a good sign
Son:
that I should quickly have a new father.
LADY MACDUFF:
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
LADY MACDUFF:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
Messenger:
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
Messenger:
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly
Messenger:
If you will take a homely man's advice,
Messenger:
Be not found here, hence, with your little ones.
Messenger:
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage,
Messenger:
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Messenger:
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
Messenger:
I dare abide no longer.
Messenger:
Exit
LADY MACDUFF:
Whither should I fly?
LADY MACDUFF:
I have done no harm. But I remember now
LADY MACDUFF:
I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
LADY MACDUFF:
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
LADY MACDUFF:
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
LADY MACDUFF:
Do I put up that womanly defence,
LADY MACDUFF:
To say I have done no harm?
LADY MACDUFF:
Enter Murderers
LADY MACDUFF:
What are these faces?
First Murderer:
Where is your husband?
LADY MACDUFF:
I hope, in no place so unsanctified
LADY MACDUFF:
Where such as thou mayst find him.
First Murderer:
He's a traitor.
Son:
Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!
First Murderer:
What, you egg!
First Murderer:
Stabbing him
First Murderer:
Young fry of treachery!
Son:
He has kill'd me, mother
Son:
Run away, I pray you!
Son:
Dies
Son:
Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following her
Son:
SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.
Son:
Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF
MALCOLM:
Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
MALCOLM:
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
MACDUFF:
Let us rather
MACDUFF:
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
MACDUFF:
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
MACDUFF:
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
MACDUFF:
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
MACDUFF:
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
MACDUFF:
Like syllable of dolour.
MALCOLM:
What I believe I'll wail,
MALCOLM:
What know believe, and what I can redress,
MALCOLM:
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
MALCOLM:
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
MALCOLM:
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
MALCOLM:
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
MALCOLM:
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young,
MALCOLM:
but something
MALCOLM:
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
MALCOLM:
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
MALCOLM:
To appease an angry god.
MACDUFF:
I am not treacherous.
MALCOLM:
But Macbeth is.
MALCOLM:
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
MALCOLM:
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
MALCOLM:
your pardon,
MALCOLM:
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
MALCOLM:
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell,
MALCOLM:
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
MALCOLM:
Yet grace must still look so.
MACDUFF:
I have lost my hopes.
MALCOLM:
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
MALCOLM:
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
MALCOLM:
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
MALCOLM:
Without leave-taking? I pray you,
MALCOLM:
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
MALCOLM:
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
MALCOLM:
Whatever I shall think.
MACDUFF:
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
MACDUFF:
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
MACDUFF:
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
MACDUFF:
thy wrongs,
MACDUFF:
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord
MACDUFF:
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
MACDUFF:
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
MACDUFF:
And the rich East to boot.
MALCOLM:
Be not offended
MALCOLM:
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
MALCOLM:
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke,
MALCOLM:
It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
MALCOLM:
Is added to her wounds: I think withal
MALCOLM:
There would be hands uplifted in my right,
MALCOLM:
And here from gracious England have I offer
MALCOLM:
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
MALCOLM:
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
MALCOLM:
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
MALCOLM:
Shall have more vices than it had before,
MALCOLM:
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
MALCOLM:
By him that shall succeed.
MACDUFF:
What should he be?
MALCOLM:
It is myself I mean: in whom I know
MALCOLM:
All the particulars of vice so grafted
MALCOLM:
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
MALCOLM:
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
MALCOLM:
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
MALCOLM:
With my confineless harms.
MACDUFF:
Not in the legions
MACDUFF:
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
MACDUFF:
In evils to top Macbeth.
MALCOLM:
I grant him bloody,
MALCOLM:
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
MALCOLM:
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
MALCOLM:
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
MALCOLM:
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
MALCOLM:
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
MALCOLM:
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
MALCOLM:
All continent impediments would o'erbear
MALCOLM:
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
MALCOLM:
Than such an one to reign.
MACDUFF:
Boundless intemperance
MACDUFF:
In nature is a tyranny, it hath been
MACDUFF:
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
MACDUFF:
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
MACDUFF:
To take upon you what is yours: you may
MACDUFF:
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
MACDUFF:
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
MACDUFF:
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
MACDUFF:
That vulture in you, to devour so many
MACDUFF:
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
MACDUFF:
Finding it so inclined.
MALCOLM:
With this there grows
MALCOLM:
In my most ill-composed affection such
MALCOLM:
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
MALCOLM:
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
MALCOLM:
Desire his jewels and this other's house
MALCOLM:
And my more-having would be as a sauce
MALCOLM:
To make me hunger more, that I should forge
MALCOLM:
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
MALCOLM:
Destroying them for wealth.
MACDUFF:
This avarice
MACDUFF:
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
MACDUFF:
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
MACDUFF:
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear,
MACDUFF:
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
MACDUFF:
Of your mere own: all these are portable,
MACDUFF:
With other graces weigh'd.
MALCOLM:
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
MALCOLM:
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
MALCOLM:
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
MALCOLM:
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
MALCOLM:
I have no relish of them, but abound
MALCOLM:
In the division of each several crime,
MALCOLM:
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
MALCOLM:
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
MALCOLM:
Uproar the universal peace, confound
MALCOLM:
All unity on earth.
MACDUFF:
O Scotland, Scotland!
MALCOLM:
If such a one be fit to govern, speak
MALCOLM:
I am as I have spoken.
MACDUFF:
Fit to govern!
MACDUFF:
No, not to live. O nation miserable,
MACDUFF:
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
MACDUFF:
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
MACDUFF:
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
MACDUFF:
By his own interdiction stands accursed,
MACDUFF:
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
MACDUFF:
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
MACDUFF:
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
MACDUFF:
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
MACDUFF:
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
MACDUFF:
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
MACDUFF:
Thy hope ends here!
MALCOLM:
Macduff, this noble passion,
MALCOLM:
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
MALCOLM:
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
MALCOLM:
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
MALCOLM:
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
MALCOLM:
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
MALCOLM:
From over-credulous haste: but God above
MALCOLM:
Deal between thee and me! for even now
MALCOLM:
I put myself to thy direction, and
MALCOLM:
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
MALCOLM:
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
MALCOLM:
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
MALCOLM:
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
MALCOLM:
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
MALCOLM:
At no time broke my faith, would not betray
MALCOLM:
The devil to his fellow and delight
MALCOLM:
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
MALCOLM:
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
MALCOLM:
Is thine and my poor country's to command
MALCOLM:
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
MALCOLM:
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
MALCOLM:
Already at a point, was setting forth.
MALCOLM:
Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness
MALCOLM:
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?
MACDUFF:
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
MACDUFF:
'Tis hard to reconcile.
MACDUFF:
Enter a Doctor
MALCOLM:
Well, more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?
Doctor:
Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls
Doctor:
That stay his cure: their malady convinces
Doctor:
The great assay of art, but at his touch--
Doctor:
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
Doctor:
They presently amend.
MALCOLM:
I thank you, doctor.
MALCOLM:
Exit Doctor
MACDUFF:
What's the disease he means?
MALCOLM:
'Tis call'd the evil
MALCOLM:
A most miraculous work in this good king,
MALCOLM:
Which often, since my here-remain in England,
MALCOLM:
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
MALCOLM:
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
MALCOLM:
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
MALCOLM:
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
MALCOLM:
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
MALCOLM:
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
MALCOLM:
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
MALCOLM:
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
MALCOLM:
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
MALCOLM:
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
MALCOLM:
That speak him full of grace.
MALCOLM:
Enter ROSS
MACDUFF:
See, who comes here?
MALCOLM:
My countryman, but yet I know him not.
MACDUFF:
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.
MALCOLM:
I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
MALCOLM:
The means that makes us strangers!
ROSS:
Sir, amen.
MACDUFF:
Stands Scotland where it did?
ROSS:
Alas, poor country!
ROSS:
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
ROSS:
Be call'd our mother, but our grave, where nothing,
ROSS:
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile,
ROSS:
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
ROSS:
Are made, not mark'd, where violent sorrow seems
ROSS:
A modern ecstasy, the dead man's knell
ROSS:
Is there scarce ask'd for who, and good men's lives
ROSS:
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
ROSS:
Dying or ere they sicken.
MACDUFF:
O, relation
MACDUFF:
Too nice, and yet too true!
MALCOLM:
What's the newest grief?
ROSS:
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker
ROSS:
Each minute teems a new one.
MACDUFF:
How does my wife?
ROSS:
Why, well.
MACDUFF:
And all my children?
ROSS:
Well too.
MACDUFF:
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
ROSS:
No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
MACDUFF:
But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?
ROSS:
When I came hither to transport the tidings,
ROSS:
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
ROSS:
Of many worthy fellows that were out,
ROSS:
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
ROSS:
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot
ROSS:
Now is the time of help, your eye in Scotland
ROSS:
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
ROSS:
To doff their dire distresses.
MALCOLM:
Be't their comfort
MALCOLM:
We are coming thither: gracious England hath
MALCOLM:
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men,
MALCOLM:
An older and a better soldier none
MALCOLM:
That Christendom gives out.
ROSS:
Would I could answer
ROSS:
This comfort with the like! But I have words
ROSS:
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
ROSS:
Where hearing should not latch them.
MACDUFF:
What concern they?
MACDUFF:
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
MACDUFF:
Due to some single breast?
ROSS:
No mind that's honest
ROSS:
But in it shares some woe, though the main part
ROSS:
Pertains to you alone.
MACDUFF:
If it be mine,
MACDUFF:
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
ROSS:
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
ROSS:
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
ROSS:
That ever yet they heard.
MACDUFF:
Hum! I guess at it.
ROSS:
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes
ROSS:
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
ROSS:
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
ROSS:
To add the death of you.
MALCOLM:
Merciful heaven!
MALCOLM:
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows,
MALCOLM:
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
MALCOLM:
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
MACDUFF:
My children too?
ROSS:
Wife, children, servants, all
ROSS:
That could be found.
MACDUFF:
And I must be from thence!
MACDUFF:
My wife kill'd too?
ROSS:
I have said.
MALCOLM:
Be comforted
MALCOLM:
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
MALCOLM:
To cure this deadly grief.
MACDUFF:
He has no children. All my pretty ones?
MACDUFF:
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
MACDUFF:
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
MACDUFF:
At one fell swoop?
MALCOLM:
Dispute it like a man.
MACDUFF:
I shall do so,
MACDUFF:
But I must also feel it as a man
MACDUFF:
I cannot but remember such things were,
MACDUFF:
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
MACDUFF:
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
MACDUFF:
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
MACDUFF:
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
MACDUFF:
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!
MALCOLM:
Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
MALCOLM:
Convert to anger, blunt not the heart, enrage it.
MACDUFF:
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
MACDUFF:
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
MACDUFF:
Cut short all intermission, front to front
MACDUFF:
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself,
MACDUFF:
Within my sword's length set him, if he 'scape,
MACDUFF:
Heaven forgive him too!
MALCOLM:
This tune goes manly.
MALCOLM:
Come, go we to the king, our power is ready,
MALCOLM:
Our lack is nothing but our leave, Macbeth
MALCOLM:
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
MALCOLM:
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may
MALCOLM:
The night is long that never finds the day.
MALCOLM:
Exeunt
MALCOLM:
ACT V
MALCOLM:
SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.
MALCOLM:
Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman
Doctor:
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
Doctor:
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
Gentlewoman:
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
Gentlewoman:
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
Gentlewoman:
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
Gentlewoman:
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
Gentlewoman:
return to bed, yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
Doctor:
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
Doctor:
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
Doctor:
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
Doctor:
walking and other actual performances, what, at any
Doctor:
time, have you heard her say?
Gentlewoman:
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
Doctor:
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
Gentlewoman:
Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to
Gentlewoman:
confirm my speech.
Gentlewoman:
Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper
Gentlewoman:
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise,
Gentlewoman:
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her, stand close.
Doctor:
How came she by that light?
Gentlewoman:
Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
Gentlewoman:
continually, 'tis her command.
Doctor:
You see, her eyes are open.
Gentlewoman:
Ay, but their sense is shut.
Doctor:
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.
Gentlewoman:
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
Gentlewoman:
washing her hands: I have known her continue in
Gentlewoman:
this a quarter of an hour.
LADY MACBETH:
Yet here's a spot.
Doctor:
Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
Doctor:
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
LADY MACBETH:
Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
LADY MACBETH:
then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
LADY MACBETH:
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
LADY MACBETH:
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
LADY MACBETH:
account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
LADY MACBETH:
to have had so much blood in him.
Doctor:
Do you mark that?
LADY MACBETH:
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
LADY MACBETH:
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
LADY MACBETH:
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
LADY MACBETH:
this starting.
Doctor:
Go to, go to, you have known what you should not.
Gentlewoman:
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
Gentlewoman:
that: heaven knows what she has known.
LADY MACBETH:
Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
LADY MACBETH:
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
LADY MACBETH:
hand. Oh, oh, oh!
Doctor:
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
Gentlewoman:
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
Gentlewoman:
dignity of the whole body.
Doctor:
Well, well, well,--
Gentlewoman:
Pray God it be, sir.
Doctor:
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
Doctor:
those which have walked in their sleep who have died
Doctor:
holily in their beds.
LADY MACBETH:
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not so
LADY MACBETH:
pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried, he
LADY MACBETH:
cannot come out on's grave.
Doctor:
Even so?
LADY MACBETH:
To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate
LADY MACBETH:
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
LADY MACBETH:
done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!
LADY MACBETH:
Exit
Doctor:
Will she go now to bed?
Gentlewoman:
Directly.
Doctor:
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
Doctor:
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
Doctor:
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets
Doctor:
More needs she the divine than the physician.
Doctor:
God, God forgive us all! Look after her,
Doctor:
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
Doctor:
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night
Doctor:
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
Doctor:
I think, but dare not speak.
Gentlewoman:
Good night, good doctor.
Gentlewoman:
Exeunt
Gentlewoman:
SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.
Gentlewoman:
Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and Soldiers
MENTEITH:
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
MENTEITH:
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff
MENTEITH:
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes
MENTEITH:
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
MENTEITH:
Excite the mortified man.
ANGUS:
Near Birnam wood
ANGUS:
Shall we well meet them, that way are they coming.
CAITHNESS:
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
LENNOX:
For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
LENNOX:
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
LENNOX:
And many unrough youths that even now
LENNOX:
Protest their first of manhood.
MENTEITH:
What does the tyrant?
CAITHNESS:
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies
CAITHNESS:
Some say he's mad, others that lesser hate him
CAITHNESS:
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
CAITHNESS:
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
CAITHNESS:
Within the belt of rule.
ANGUS:
Now does he feel
ANGUS:
His secret murders sticking on his hands,
ANGUS:
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach,
ANGUS:
Those he commands move only in command,
ANGUS:
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
ANGUS:
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
ANGUS:
Upon a dwarfish thief.
MENTEITH:
Who then shall blame
MENTEITH:
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
MENTEITH:
When all that is within him does condemn
MENTEITH:
Itself for being there?
CAITHNESS:
Well, march we on,
CAITHNESS:
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed
CAITHNESS:
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
CAITHNESS:
And with him pour we in our country's purge
CAITHNESS:
Each drop of us.
LENNOX:
Or so much as it needs,
LENNOX:
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
LENNOX:
Make we our march towards Birnam.
LENNOX:
Exeunt, marching
LENNOX:
SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.
LENNOX:
Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants
MACBETH:
Bring me no more reports, let them fly all
MACBETH:
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
MACBETH:
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
MACBETH:
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
MACBETH:
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus
MACBETH:
'Fear not, Macbeth, no man that's born of woman
MACBETH:
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
MACBETH:
false thanes,
MACBETH:
And mingle with the English epicures
MACBETH:
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
MACBETH:
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
MACBETH:
Enter a Servant
MACBETH:
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
MACBETH:
Where got'st thou that goose look?
Servant:
There is ten thousand--
MACBETH:
Geese, villain!
Servant:
Soldiers, sir.
MACBETH:
Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
MACBETH:
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
MACBETH:
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
MACBETH:
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?
Servant:
The English force, so please you.
MACBETH:
Take thy face hence.
MACBETH:
Exit Servant
MACBETH:
Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
MACBETH:
When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
MACBETH:
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
MACBETH:
I have lived long enough: my way of life
MACBETH:
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,
MACBETH:
And that which should accompany old age,
MACBETH:
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
MACBETH:
I must not look to have, but, in their stead,
MACBETH:
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
MACBETH:
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!
MACBETH:
Enter SEYTON
SEYTON:
What is your gracious pleasure?
MACBETH:
What news more?
SEYTON:
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
MACBETH:
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
MACBETH:
Give me my armour.
SEYTON:
'Tis not needed yet.
MACBETH:
I'll put it on.
MACBETH:
Send out more horses, skirr the country round,
MACBETH:
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
MACBETH:
How does your patient, doctor?
Doctor:
Not so sick, my lord,
Doctor:
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
Doctor:
That keep her from her rest.
MACBETH:
Cure her of that.
MACBETH:
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
MACBETH:
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
MACBETH:
Raze out the written troubles of the brain
MACBETH:
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
MACBETH:
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
MACBETH:
Which weighs upon the heart?
Doctor:
Therein the patient
Doctor:
Must minister to himself.
MACBETH:
Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.
MACBETH:
Come, put mine armour on, give me my staff.
MACBETH:
Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
MACBETH:
Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
MACBETH:
The water of my land, find her disease,
MACBETH:
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
MACBETH:
I would applaud thee to the very echo,
MACBETH:
That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
MACBETH:
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
MACBETH:
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?
Doctor:
Ay, my good lord, your royal preparation
Doctor:
Makes us hear something.
MACBETH:
Bring it after me.
MACBETH:
I will not be afraid of death and bane,
MACBETH:
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.
Doctor:
[Aside]  Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
Doctor:
Profit again should hardly draw me here.
Doctor:
Exeunt
Doctor:
SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.
Doctor:
Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG  SIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching
MALCOLM:
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
MALCOLM:
That chambers will be safe.
MENTEITH:
We doubt it nothing.
SIWARD:
What wood is this before us?
MENTEITH:
The wood of Birnam.
MALCOLM:
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
MALCOLM:
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
MALCOLM:
The numbers of our host and make discovery
MALCOLM:
Err in report of us.
Soldiers:
It shall be done.
SIWARD:
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
SIWARD:
Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
SIWARD:
Our setting down before 't.
MALCOLM:
'Tis his main hope
MALCOLM:
For where there is advantage to be given,
MALCOLM:
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
MALCOLM:
And none serve with him but constrained things
MALCOLM:
Whose hearts are absent too.
MACDUFF:
Let our just censures
MACDUFF:
Attend the true event, and put we on
MACDUFF:
Industrious soldiership.
SIWARD:
The time approaches
SIWARD:
That will with due decision make us know
SIWARD:
What we shall say we have and what we owe.
SIWARD:
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
SIWARD:
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate
SIWARD:
Towards which advance the war.
SIWARD:
Exeunt, marching
SIWARD:
SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.
SIWARD:
Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and colours
MACBETH:
Hang out our banners on the outward walls,
MACBETH:
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
MACBETH:
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
MACBETH:
Till famine and the ague eat them up
MACBETH:
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
MACBETH:
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
MACBETH:
And beat them backward home.
MACBETH:
A cry of women within
MACBETH:
What is that noise?
SEYTON:
It is the cry of women, my good lord.
SEYTON:
Exit
MACBETH:
I have almost forgot the taste of fears,
MACBETH:
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
MACBETH:
To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
MACBETH:
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
MACBETH:
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors,
MACBETH:
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
MACBETH:
Cannot once start me.
MACBETH:
Re-enter SEYTON
MACBETH:
Wherefore was that cry?
SEYTON:
The queen, my lord, is dead.
MACBETH:
She should have died hereafter,
MACBETH:
There would have been a time for such a word.
MACBETH:
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
MACBETH:
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
MACBETH:
To the last syllable of recorded time,
MACBETH:
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
MACBETH:
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
MACBETH:
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
MACBETH:
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
MACBETH:
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
MACBETH:
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
MACBETH:
Signifying nothing.
MACBETH:
Enter a Messenger
MACBETH:
Thou comest to use thy tongue, thy story quickly.
Messenger:
Gracious my lord,
Messenger:
I should report that which I say I saw,
Messenger:
But know not how to do it.
MACBETH:
Well, say, sir.
Messenger:
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
Messenger:
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
Messenger:
The wood began to move.
MACBETH:
Liar and slave!
Messenger:
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so
Messenger:
Within this three mile may you see it coming,
Messenger:
I say, a moving grove.
MACBETH:
If thou speak'st false,
MACBETH:
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
MACBETH:
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
MACBETH:
I care not if thou dost for me as much.
MACBETH:
I pull in resolution, and begin
MACBETH:
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
MACBETH:
That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
MACBETH:
Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood
MACBETH:
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
MACBETH:
If this which he avouches does appear,
MACBETH:
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
MACBETH:
I gin to be aweary of the sun,
MACBETH:
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
MACBETH:
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
MACBETH:
At least we'll die with harness on our back.
MACBETH:
Exeunt
MACBETH:
SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.
MACBETH:
Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their Army, with boughs
MALCOLM:
Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
MALCOLM:
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
MALCOLM:
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
MALCOLM:
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
MALCOLM:
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
MALCOLM:
According to our order.
SIWARD:
Fare you well.
SIWARD:
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
SIWARD:
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.
MACDUFF:
Make all our trumpets speak, give them all breath,
MACDUFF:
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
MACDUFF:
Exeunt
MACDUFF:
SCENE VII. Another part of the field.
MACDUFF:
Alarums. Enter MACBETH
MACBETH:
They have tied me to a stake, I cannot fly,
MACBETH:
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
MACBETH:
That was not born of woman? Such a one
MACBETH:
Am I to fear, or none.
MACBETH:
Enter YOUNG SIWARD
YOUNG SIWARD:
What is thy name?
MACBETH:
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
YOUNG SIWARD:
No, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
YOUNG SIWARD:
Than any is in hell.
MACBETH:
My name's Macbeth.
YOUNG SIWARD:
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
YOUNG SIWARD:
More hateful to mine ear.
MACBETH:
No, nor more fearful.
YOUNG SIWARD:
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant, with my sword
YOUNG SIWARD:
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
YOUNG SIWARD:
They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain
MACBETH:
Thou wast born of woman
MACBETH:
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
MACBETH:
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
MACBETH:
Exit
MACBETH:
Alarums. Enter MACDUFF
MACDUFF:
That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
MACDUFF:
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
MACDUFF:
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
MACDUFF:
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
MACDUFF:
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
MACDUFF:
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
MACDUFF:
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be,
MACDUFF:
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
MACDUFF:
Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
MACDUFF:
And more I beg not.
MACDUFF:
Exit. Alarums
MACDUFF:
Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD
SIWARD:
This way, my lord, the castle's gently render'd
SIWARD:
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight,
SIWARD:
The noble thanes do bravely in the war,
SIWARD:
The day almost itself professes yours,
SIWARD:
And little is to do.
MALCOLM:
We have met with foes
MALCOLM:
That strike beside us.
SIWARD:
Enter, sir, the castle.
SIWARD:
Exeunt. Alarums
SIWARD:
SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.
SIWARD:
Enter MACBETH
MACBETH:
Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
MACBETH:
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
MACBETH:
Do better upon them.
MACBETH:
Enter MACDUFF
MACDUFF:
Turn, hell-hound, turn!
MACBETH:
Of all men else I have avoided thee
MACBETH:
But get thee back, my soul is too much charged
MACBETH:
With blood of thine already.
MACDUFF:
I have no words
MACDUFF:
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
MACDUFF:
Than terms can give thee out!
MACDUFF:
They fight
MACBETH:
Thou losest labour
MACBETH:
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
MACBETH:
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
MACBETH:
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests,
MACBETH:
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
MACBETH:
To one of woman born.
MACDUFF:
Despair thy charm,
MACDUFF:
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
MACDUFF:
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
MACDUFF:
Untimely ripp'd.
MACBETH:
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
MACBETH:
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
MACBETH:
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
MACBETH:
That palter with us in a double sense,
MACBETH:
That keep the word of promise to our ear,
MACBETH:
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
MACDUFF:
Then yield thee, coward,
MACDUFF:
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time
MACDUFF:
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
MACDUFF:
Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
MACDUFF:
'Here may you see the tyrant.'
MACBETH:
I will not yield,
MACBETH:
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
MACBETH:
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
MACBETH:
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
MACBETH:
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
MACBETH:
Yet I will try the last. Before my body
MACBETH:
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
MACBETH:
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
MACBETH:
Exeunt, fighting. Alarums
MACBETH:
Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers
MALCOLM:
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
SIWARD:
Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
SIWARD:
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
MALCOLM:
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
ROSS:
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt
ROSS:
He only lived but till he was a man,
ROSS:
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
ROSS:
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
ROSS:
But like a man he died.
SIWARD:
Then he is dead?
ROSS:
Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
ROSS:
Must not be measured by his worth, for then
ROSS:
It hath no end.
SIWARD:
Had he his hurts before?
ROSS:
Ay, on the front.
SIWARD:
Why then, God's soldier be he!
SIWARD:
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
SIWARD:
I would not wish them to a fairer death
SIWARD:
And so, his knell is knoll'd.
MALCOLM:
He's worth more sorrow,
MALCOLM:
And that I'll spend for him.
SIWARD:
He's worth no more
SIWARD:
They say he parted well, and paid his score
SIWARD:
And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.
SIWARD:
Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head
MACDUFF:
Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
MACDUFF:
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free
MACDUFF:
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
MACDUFF:
That speak my salutation in their minds,
MACDUFF:
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine
MACDUFF:
Hail, King of Scotland!
ALL:
Hail, King of Scotland!
ALL:
Flourish
MALCOLM:
We shall not spend a large expense of time
MALCOLM:
Before we reckon with your several loves,
MALCOLM:
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
MALCOLM:
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
MALCOLM:
In such an honour named. What's more to do,
MALCOLM:
Which would be planted newly with the time,
MALCOLM:
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
MALCOLM:
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,
MALCOLM:
Producing forth the cruel ministers
MALCOLM:
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
MALCOLM:
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
MALCOLM:
Took off her life, this, and what needful else
MALCOLM:
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
MALCOLM:
We will perform in measure, time and place
MALCOLM:
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
MALCOLM:
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
MALCOLM:
Flourish. Exeunt
