KING HENRY VIII:
ACT I
KING HENRY VIII:
SCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.
KING HENRY VIII:
Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX, SALISBURY, and others, with CHATILLON
KING JOHN:
Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
CHATILLON:
Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
CHATILLON:
In my behavior to the majesty,
CHATILLON:
The borrow'd majesty, of England here.
QUEEN ELINOR:
A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'
KING JOHN:
Silence, good mother, hear the embassy.
CHATILLON:
Philip of France, in right and true behalf
CHATILLON:
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
CHATILLON:
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
CHATILLON:
To this fair island and the territories,
CHATILLON:
To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
CHATILLON:
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
CHATILLON:
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
CHATILLON:
And put these same into young Arthur's hand,
CHATILLON:
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
KING JOHN:
What follows if we disallow of this?
CHATILLON:
The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
CHATILLON:
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
KING JOHN:
Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
KING JOHN:
Controlment for controlment: so answer France.
CHATILLON:
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
CHATILLON:
The farthest limit of my embassy.
KING JOHN:
Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace
KING JOHN:
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France,
KING JOHN:
For ere thou canst report I will be there,
KING JOHN:
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard
KING JOHN:
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
KING JOHN:
And sullen presage of your own decay.
KING JOHN:
An honourable conduct let him have
KING JOHN:
Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.
KING JOHN:
Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE
QUEEN ELINOR:
What now, my son! have I not ever said
QUEEN ELINOR:
How that ambitious Constance would not cease
QUEEN ELINOR:
Till she had kindled France and all the world,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Upon the right and party of her son?
QUEEN ELINOR:
This might have been prevented and made whole
QUEEN ELINOR:
With very easy arguments of love,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
QUEEN ELINOR:
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
KING JOHN:
Our strong possession and our right for us.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Your strong possession much more than your right,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Or else it must go wrong with you and me
QUEEN ELINOR:
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Enter a Sheriff
ESSEX:
My liege, here is the strangest controversy
ESSEX:
Come from country to be judged by you,
ESSEX:
That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?
KING JOHN:
Let them approach.
KING JOHN:
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
KING JOHN:
This expedition's charge.
KING JOHN:
Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD
KING JOHN:
What men are you?
BASTARD:
Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
BASTARD:
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,
BASTARD:
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,
BASTARD:
A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
BASTARD:
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
KING JOHN:
What art thou?
ROBERT:
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
KING JOHN:
Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
KING JOHN:
You came not of one mother then, it seems.
BASTARD:
Most certain of one mother, mighty king,
BASTARD:
That is well known, and, as I think, one father
BASTARD:
But for the certain knowledge of that truth
BASTARD:
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother
BASTARD:
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
QUEEN ELINOR:
And wound her honour with this diffidence.
BASTARD:
I, madam? no, I have no reason for it,
BASTARD:
That is my brother's plea and none of mine,
BASTARD:
The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
BASTARD:
At least from fair five hundred pound a year
BASTARD:
Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
KING JOHN:
A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
KING JOHN:
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
BASTARD:
I know not why, except to get the land.
BASTARD:
But once he slander'd me with bastardy
BASTARD:
But whether I be as true begot or no,
BASTARD:
That still I lay upon my mother's head,
BASTARD:
But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
BASTARD:
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
BASTARD:
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
BASTARD:
If old sir Robert did beget us both
BASTARD:
And were our father and this son like him,
BASTARD:
O old sir Robert, father, on my knee
BASTARD:
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
KING JOHN:
Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
QUEEN ELINOR:
He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face,
QUEEN ELINOR:
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Do you not read some tokens of my son
QUEEN ELINOR:
In the large composition of this man?
KING JOHN:
Mine eye hath well examined his parts
KING JOHN:
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
KING JOHN:
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
BASTARD:
Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
BASTARD:
With half that face would he have all my land
BASTARD:
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!
ROBERT:
My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
ROBERT:
Your brother did employ my father much,--
BASTARD:
Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land
BASTARD:
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
ROBERT:
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
ROBERT:
To Germany, there with the emperor
ROBERT:
To treat of high affairs touching that time.
ROBERT:
The advantage of his absence took the king
ROBERT:
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's,
ROBERT:
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
ROBERT:
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
ROBERT:
Between my father and my mother lay,
ROBERT:
As I have heard my father speak himself,
ROBERT:
When this same lusty gentleman was got.
ROBERT:
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
ROBERT:
His lands to me, and took it on his death
ROBERT:
That this my mother's son was none of his,
ROBERT:
And if he were, he came into the world
ROBERT:
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
ROBERT:
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
ROBERT:
My father's land, as was my father's will.
KING JOHN:
Sirrah, your brother is legitimate,
KING JOHN:
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
KING JOHN:
And if she did play false, the fault was hers,
KING JOHN:
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
KING JOHN:
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
KING JOHN:
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
KING JOHN:
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
KING JOHN:
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
KING JOHN:
This calf bred from his cow from all the world,
KING JOHN:
In sooth he might, then, if he were my brother's,
KING JOHN:
My brother might not claim him, nor your father,
KING JOHN:
Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes,
KING JOHN:
My mother's son did get your father's heir,
KING JOHN:
Your father's heir must have your father's land.
ROBERT:
Shall then my father's will be of no force
ROBERT:
To dispossess that child which is not his?
BASTARD:
Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
BASTARD:
Than was his will to get me, as I think.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
QUEEN ELINOR:
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?
BASTARD:
Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
BASTARD:
And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him,
BASTARD:
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
BASTARD:
My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
BASTARD:
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
BASTARD:
Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'
BASTARD:
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
BASTARD:
Would I might never stir from off this place,
BASTARD:
I would give it every foot to have this face,
BASTARD:
I would not be sir Nob in any case.
QUEEN ELINOR:
I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
QUEEN ELINOR:
I am a soldier and now bound to France.
BASTARD:
Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
BASTARD:
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
BASTARD:
Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
BASTARD:
Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
BASTARD:
Our country manners give our betters way.
KING JOHN:
What is thy name?
BASTARD:
Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
BASTARD:
Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.
KING JOHN:
From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st
KING JOHN:
Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,
KING JOHN:
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.
BASTARD:
Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand
BASTARD:
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
BASTARD:
Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,
BASTARD:
When I was got, sir Robert was away!
QUEEN ELINOR:
The very spirit of Plantagenet!
QUEEN ELINOR:
I am thy grandam, Richard, call me so.
BASTARD:
Madam, by chance but not by truth, what though?
BASTARD:
Something about, a little from the right,
BASTARD:
In at the window, or else o'er the hatch
BASTARD:
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
BASTARD:
And have is have, however men do catch
BASTARD:
Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
BASTARD:
And I am I, howe'er I was begot.
KING JOHN:
Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire,
KING JOHN:
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
KING JOHN:
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
KING JOHN:
For France, for France, for it is more than need.
BASTARD:
Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
BASTARD:
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
BASTARD:
Exeunt all but BASTARD
BASTARD:
A foot of honour better than I was,
BASTARD:
But many a many foot of land the worse.
BASTARD:
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
BASTARD:
'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--
BASTARD:
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter,
BASTARD:
For new-made honour doth forget men's names,
BASTARD:
'Tis too respective and too sociable
BASTARD:
For your conversion. Now your traveller,
BASTARD:
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
BASTARD:
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
BASTARD:
Why then I suck my teeth and catechise
BASTARD:
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
BASTARD:
Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
BASTARD:
'I shall beseech you'--that is question now,
BASTARD:
And then comes answer like an Absey book
BASTARD:
'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command,
BASTARD:
At your employment, at your service, sir,'
BASTARD:
'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
BASTARD:
And so, ere answer knows what question would,
BASTARD:
Saving in dialogue of compliment,
BASTARD:
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
BASTARD:
The Pyrenean and the river Po,
BASTARD:
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
BASTARD:
But this is worshipful society
BASTARD:
And fits the mounting spirit like myself,
BASTARD:
For he is but a bastard to the time
BASTARD:
That doth not smack of observation,
BASTARD:
And so am I, whether I smack or no,
BASTARD:
And not alone in habit and device,
BASTARD:
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
BASTARD:
But from the inward motion to deliver
BASTARD:
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth
BASTARD:
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
BASTARD:
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn,
BASTARD:
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
BASTARD:
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
BASTARD:
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
BASTARD:
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
BASTARD:
Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY
BASTARD:
O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!
BASTARD:
What brings you here to court so hastily?
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
BASTARD:
My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
BASTARD:
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
BASTARD:
Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.
BASTARD:
James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
GURNEY:
Good leave, good Philip.
BASTARD:
Philip! sparrow: James,
BASTARD:
There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
BASTARD:
Exit GURNEY
BASTARD:
Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son
BASTARD:
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
BASTARD:
Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast
BASTARD:
Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
BASTARD:
Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it
BASTARD:
We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
BASTARD:
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
BASTARD:
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?
BASTARD:
Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
BASTARD:
What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.
BASTARD:
But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son,
BASTARD:
I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land,
BASTARD:
Legitimation, name and all is gone
BASTARD:
Then, good my mother, let me know my father,
BASTARD:
Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
BASTARD:
As faithfully as I deny the devil.
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
By long and vehement suit I was seduced
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
To make room for him in my husband's bed
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Which was so strongly urged past my defence.
BASTARD:
Now, by this light, were I to get again,
BASTARD:
Madam, I would not wish a better father.
BASTARD:
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
BASTARD:
And so doth yours, your fault was not your folly
BASTARD:
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
BASTARD:
Subjected tribute to commanding love,
BASTARD:
Against whose fury and unmatched force
BASTARD:
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
BASTARD:
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
BASTARD:
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
BASTARD:
May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
BASTARD:
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
BASTARD:
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
BASTARD:
When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
BASTARD:
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin,
BASTARD:
And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
BASTARD:
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin
BASTARD:
Who says it was, he lies, I say 'twas not.
BASTARD:
Exeunt
BASTARD:
ACT II
BASTARD:
SCENE I. France. Before Angiers.
BASTARD:
Enter AUSTRIA and forces, drums, etc. on one side:  on the other KING PHILIP and his power, LEWIS, ARTHUR, CONSTANCE and attendants
LEWIS:
Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
LEWIS:
Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
LEWIS:
Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
LEWIS:
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
LEWIS:
By this brave duke came early to his grave
LEWIS:
And for amends to his posterity,
LEWIS:
At our importance hither is he come,
LEWIS:
To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,
LEWIS:
And to rebuke the usurpation
LEWIS:
Of thy unnatural uncle, English John
LEWIS:
Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.
ARTHUR:
God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
ARTHUR:
The rather that you give his offspring life,
ARTHUR:
Shadowing their right under your wings of war
ARTHUR:
I give you welcome with a powerless hand,
ARTHUR:
But with a heart full of unstained love
ARTHUR:
Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.
LEWIS:
A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
AUSTRIA:
Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
AUSTRIA:
As seal to this indenture of my love,
AUSTRIA:
That to my home I will no more return,
AUSTRIA:
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
AUSTRIA:
Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,
AUSTRIA:
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
AUSTRIA:
And coops from other lands her islanders,
AUSTRIA:
Even till that England, hedged in with the main,
AUSTRIA:
That water-walled bulwark, still secure
AUSTRIA:
And confident from foreign purposes,
AUSTRIA:
Even till that utmost corner of the west
AUSTRIA:
Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
AUSTRIA:
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.
CONSTANCE:
O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
CONSTANCE:
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
CONSTANCE:
To make a more requital to your love!
AUSTRIA:
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
AUSTRIA:
In such a just and charitable war.
KING PHILIP:
Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent
KING PHILIP:
Against the brows of this resisting town.
KING PHILIP:
Call for our chiefest men of discipline,
KING PHILIP:
To cull the plots of best advantages
KING PHILIP:
We'll lay before this town our royal bones,
KING PHILIP:
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,
KING PHILIP:
But we will make it subject to this boy.
CONSTANCE:
Stay for an answer to your embassy,
CONSTANCE:
Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood
CONSTANCE:
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,
CONSTANCE:
That right in peace which here we urge in war,
CONSTANCE:
And then we shall repent each drop of blood
CONSTANCE:
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
CONSTANCE:
Enter CHATILLON
KING PHILIP:
A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,
KING PHILIP:
Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!
KING PHILIP:
What England says, say briefly, gentle lord,
KING PHILIP:
We coldly pause for thee, Chatillon, speak.
CHATILLON:
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
CHATILLON:
And stir them up against a mightier task.
CHATILLON:
England, impatient of your just demands,
CHATILLON:
Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
CHATILLON:
Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time
CHATILLON:
To land his legions all as soon as I,
CHATILLON:
His marches are expedient to this town,
CHATILLON:
His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
CHATILLON:
With him along is come the mother-queen,
CHATILLON:
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife,
CHATILLON:
With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain,
CHATILLON:
With them a bastard of the king's deceased,
CHATILLON:
And all the unsettled humours of the land,
CHATILLON:
Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
CHATILLON:
With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,
CHATILLON:
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
CHATILLON:
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
CHATILLON:
To make hazard of new fortunes here
CHATILLON:
In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
CHATILLON:
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
CHATILLON:
Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,
CHATILLON:
To do offence and scath in Christendom.
CHATILLON:
Drum beats
CHATILLON:
The interruption of their churlish drums
CHATILLON:
Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,
CHATILLON:
To parley or to fight, therefore prepare.
KING PHILIP:
How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
AUSTRIA:
By how much unexpected, by so much
AUSTRIA:
We must awake endavour for defence,
AUSTRIA:
For courage mounteth with occasion
AUSTRIA:
Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
AUSTRIA:
Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, BLANCH, the BASTARD, Lords, and forces
KING JOHN:
Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
KING JOHN:
Our just and lineal entrance to our own,
KING JOHN:
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
KING JOHN:
Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct
KING JOHN:
Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.
KING PHILIP:
Peace be to England, if that war return
KING PHILIP:
From France to England, there to live in peace.
KING PHILIP:
England we love, and for that England's sake
KING PHILIP:
With burden of our armour here we sweat.
KING PHILIP:
This toil of ours should be a work of thine,
KING PHILIP:
But thou from loving England art so far,
KING PHILIP:
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king
KING PHILIP:
Cut off the sequence of posterity,
KING PHILIP:
Out-faced infant state and done a rape
KING PHILIP:
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
KING PHILIP:
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face,
KING PHILIP:
These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his
KING PHILIP:
This little abstract doth contain that large
KING PHILIP:
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time
KING PHILIP:
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
KING PHILIP:
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
KING PHILIP:
And this his son, England was Geffrey's right
KING PHILIP:
And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God
KING PHILIP:
How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,
KING PHILIP:
When living blood doth in these temples beat,
KING PHILIP:
Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?
KING JOHN:
From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
KING JOHN:
To draw my answer from thy articles?
KING PHILIP:
From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts
KING PHILIP:
In any breast of strong authority,
KING PHILIP:
To look into the blots and stains of right
KING PHILIP:
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy
KING PHILIP:
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
KING PHILIP:
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
KING JOHN:
Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
KING PHILIP:
Excuse, it is to beat usurping down.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
CONSTANCE:
Let me make answer, thy usurping son.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,
QUEEN ELINOR:
That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!
CONSTANCE:
My bed was ever to thy son as true
CONSTANCE:
As thine was to thy husband, and this boy
CONSTANCE:
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
CONSTANCE:
Than thou and John in manners, being as like
CONSTANCE:
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.
CONSTANCE:
My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think
CONSTANCE:
His father never was so true begot
CONSTANCE:
It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.
QUEEN ELINOR:
There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
CONSTANCE:
There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
AUSTRIA:
Peace!
BASTARD:
Hear the crier.
AUSTRIA:
What the devil art thou?
BASTARD:
One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
BASTARD:
An a' may catch your hide and you alone
BASTARD:
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
BASTARD:
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard,
BASTARD:
I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right,
BASTARD:
Sirrah, look to't, i' faith, I will, i' faith.
BLANCH:
O, well did he become that lion's robe
BLANCH:
That did disrobe the lion of that robe!
BASTARD:
It lies as sightly on the back of him
BASTARD:
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass
BASTARD:
But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,
BASTARD:
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
AUSTRIA:
What craker is this same that deafs our ears
AUSTRIA:
With this abundance of superfluous breath?
KING PHILIP:
Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.
LEWIS:
Women and fools, break off your conference.
LEWIS:
King John, this is the very sum of all,
LEWIS:
England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
LEWIS:
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee
LEWIS:
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
KING JOHN:
My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.
KING JOHN:
Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand,
KING JOHN:
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
KING JOHN:
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win
KING JOHN:
Submit thee, boy.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Come to thy grandam, child.
CONSTANCE:
Do, child, go to it grandam, child
CONSTANCE:
Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
CONSTANCE:
Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig
CONSTANCE:
There's a good grandam.
ARTHUR:
Good my mother, peace!
ARTHUR:
I would that I were low laid in my grave
ARTHUR:
I am not worth this coil that's made for me.
QUEEN ELINOR:
His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
CONSTANCE:
Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!
CONSTANCE:
His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
CONSTANCE:
Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
CONSTANCE:
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee,
CONSTANCE:
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
CONSTANCE:
To do him justice and revenge on you.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
CONSTANCE:
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!
CONSTANCE:
Call not me slanderer, thou and thine usurp
CONSTANCE:
The dominations, royalties and rights
CONSTANCE:
Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,
CONSTANCE:
Infortunate in nothing but in thee
CONSTANCE:
Thy sins are visited in this poor child,
CONSTANCE:
The canon of the law is laid on him,
CONSTANCE:
Being but the second generation
CONSTANCE:
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.
KING JOHN:
Bedlam, have done.
CONSTANCE:
I have but this to say,
CONSTANCE:
That he is not only plagued for her sin,
CONSTANCE:
But God hath made her sin and her the plague
CONSTANCE:
On this removed issue, plague for her
CONSTANCE:
And with her plague, her sin his injury,
CONSTANCE:
Her injury the beadle to her sin,
CONSTANCE:
All punish'd in the person of this child,
CONSTANCE:
And all for her, a plague upon her!
QUEEN ELINOR:
Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
QUEEN ELINOR:
A will that bars the title of thy son.
CONSTANCE:
Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will
CONSTANCE:
A woman's will, a canker'd grandam's will!
KING PHILIP:
Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate
KING PHILIP:
It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
KING PHILIP:
To these ill-tuned repetitions.
KING PHILIP:
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
KING PHILIP:
These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak
KING PHILIP:
Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.
KING PHILIP:
Trumpet sounds. Enter certain Citizens upon the walls
First Citizen:
Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
KING PHILIP:
'Tis France, for England.
KING JOHN:
England, for itself.
KING JOHN:
You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--
KING PHILIP:
You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
KING PHILIP:
Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle--
KING JOHN:
For our advantage, therefore hear us first.
KING JOHN:
These flags of France, that are advanced here
KING JOHN:
Before the eye and prospect of your town,
KING JOHN:
Have hither march'd to your endamagement
KING JOHN:
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
KING JOHN:
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
KING JOHN:
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls
KING JOHN:
All preparation for a bloody siege
KING JOHN:
All merciless proceeding by these French
KING JOHN:
Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates,
KING JOHN:
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
KING JOHN:
That as a waist doth girdle you about,
KING JOHN:
By the compulsion of their ordinance
KING JOHN:
By this time from their fixed beds of lime
KING JOHN:
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
KING JOHN:
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
KING JOHN:
But on the sight of us your lawful king,
KING JOHN:
Who painfully with much expedient march
KING JOHN:
Have brought a countercheque before your gates,
KING JOHN:
To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,
KING JOHN:
Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle,
KING JOHN:
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
KING JOHN:
To make a shaking fever in your walls,
KING JOHN:
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
KING JOHN:
To make a faithless error in your ears
KING JOHN:
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
KING JOHN:
And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,
KING JOHN:
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
KING JOHN:
Crave harbourage within your city walls.
KING PHILIP:
When I have said, make answer to us both.
KING PHILIP:
Lo, in this right hand, whose protection
KING PHILIP:
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right
KING PHILIP:
Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,
KING PHILIP:
Son to the elder brother of this man,
KING PHILIP:
And king o'er him and all that he enjoys
KING PHILIP:
For this down-trodden equity, we tread
KING PHILIP:
In warlike march these greens before your town,
KING PHILIP:
Being no further enemy to you
KING PHILIP:
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
KING PHILIP:
In the relief of this oppressed child
KING PHILIP:
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
KING PHILIP:
To pay that duty which you truly owe
KING PHILIP:
To that owes it, namely this young prince
KING PHILIP:
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
KING PHILIP:
Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up,
KING PHILIP:
Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
KING PHILIP:
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven,
KING PHILIP:
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
KING PHILIP:
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,
KING PHILIP:
We will bear home that lusty blood again
KING PHILIP:
Which here we came to spout against your town,
KING PHILIP:
And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
KING PHILIP:
But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,
KING PHILIP:
'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls
KING PHILIP:
Can hide you from our messengers of war,
KING PHILIP:
Though all these English and their discipline
KING PHILIP:
Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.
KING PHILIP:
Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
KING PHILIP:
In that behalf which we have challenged it?
KING PHILIP:
Or shall we give the signal to our rage
KING PHILIP:
And stalk in blood to our possession?
First Citizen:
In brief, we are the king of England's subjects
First Citizen:
For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
KING JOHN:
Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.
First Citizen:
That can we not, but he that proves the king,
First Citizen:
To him will we prove loyal: till that time
First Citizen:
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.
KING JOHN:
Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
KING JOHN:
And if not that, I bring you witnesses,
KING JOHN:
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--
BASTARD:
Bastards, and else.
KING JOHN:
To verify our title with their lives.
KING PHILIP:
As many and as well-born bloods as those,--
BASTARD:
Some bastards too.
KING PHILIP:
Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
First Citizen:
Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
First Citizen:
We for the worthiest hold the right from both.
KING JOHN:
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
KING JOHN:
That to their everlasting residence,
KING JOHN:
Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,
KING JOHN:
In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!
KING PHILIP:
Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!
BASTARD:
Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since
BASTARD:
Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,
BASTARD:
Teach us some fence!
BASTARD:
To AUSTRIA
BASTARD:
Sirrah, were I at home,
BASTARD:
At your den, sirrah, with your lioness
BASTARD:
I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,
BASTARD:
And make a monster of you.
AUSTRIA:
Peace! no more.
BASTARD:
O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.
KING JOHN:
Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth
KING JOHN:
In best appointment all our regiments.
BASTARD:
Speed then, to take advantage of the field.
KING PHILIP:
It shall be so, and at the other hill
KING PHILIP:
Command the rest to stand. God and our right!
KING PHILIP:
Exeunt
KING PHILIP:
Here after excursions, enter the Herald of France, with trumpets, to the gates
French Herald:
You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,
French Herald:
And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,
French Herald:
Who by the hand of France this day hath made
French Herald:
Much work for tears in many an English mother,
French Herald:
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground,
French Herald:
Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,
French Herald:
Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth,
French Herald:
And victory, with little loss, doth play
French Herald:
Upon the dancing banners of the French,
French Herald:
Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,
French Herald:
To enter conquerors and to proclaim
French Herald:
Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.
French Herald:
Enter English Herald, with trumpet
English Herald:
Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells
English Herald:
King John, your king and England's doth approach,
English Herald:
Commander of this hot malicious day
English Herald:
Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,
English Herald:
Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood,
English Herald:
There stuck no plume in any English crest
English Herald:
That is removed by a staff of France,
English Herald:
Our colours do return in those same hands
English Herald:
That did display them when we first march'd forth,
English Herald:
And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come
English Herald:
Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,
English Herald:
Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes
English Herald:
Open your gates and gives the victors way.
First Citizen:
Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,
First Citizen:
From first to last, the onset and retire
First Citizen:
Of both your armies, whose equality
First Citizen:
By our best eyes cannot be censured
First Citizen:
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows,
First Citizen:
Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power
First Citizen:
Both are alike, and both alike we like.
First Citizen:
One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,
First Citizen:
We hold our town for neither, yet for both.
First Citizen:
Re-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP, with their powers, severally
KING JOHN:
France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
KING JOHN:
Say, shall the current of our right run on?
KING JOHN:
Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,
KING JOHN:
Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
KING JOHN:
With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,
KING JOHN:
Unless thou let his silver water keep
KING JOHN:
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
KING PHILIP:
England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
KING PHILIP:
In this hot trial, more than we of France,
KING PHILIP:
Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
KING PHILIP:
That sways the earth this climate overlooks,
KING PHILIP:
Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,
KING PHILIP:
We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,
KING PHILIP:
Or add a royal number to the dead,
KING PHILIP:
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
KING PHILIP:
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
BASTARD:
Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,
BASTARD:
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
BASTARD:
O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel,
BASTARD:
The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs,
BASTARD:
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
BASTARD:
In undetermined differences of kings.
BASTARD:
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
BASTARD:
Cry, 'havoc!' kings, back to the stained field,
BASTARD:
You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
BASTARD:
Then let confusion of one part confirm
BASTARD:
The other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!
KING JOHN:
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
KING PHILIP:
Speak, citizens, for England, who's your king?
First Citizen:
The king of England, when we know the king.
KING PHILIP:
Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
KING JOHN:
In us, that are our own great deputy
KING JOHN:
And bear possession of our person here,
KING JOHN:
Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.
First Citizen:
A greater power then we denies all this,
First Citizen:
And till it be undoubted, we do lock
First Citizen:
Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates,
First Citizen:
King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,
First Citizen:
Be by some certain king purged and deposed.
BASTARD:
By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
BASTARD:
And stand securely on their battlements,
BASTARD:
As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
BASTARD:
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
BASTARD:
Your royal presences be ruled by me
BASTARD:
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
BASTARD:
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
BASTARD:
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
BASTARD:
By east and west let France and England mount
BASTARD:
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
BASTARD:
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
BASTARD:
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
BASTARD:
I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
BASTARD:
Even till unfenced desolation
BASTARD:
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
BASTARD:
That done, dissever your united strengths,
BASTARD:
And part your mingled colours once again,
BASTARD:
Turn face to face and bloody point to point,
BASTARD:
Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
BASTARD:
Out of one side her happy minion,
BASTARD:
To whom in favour she shall give the day,
BASTARD:
And kiss him with a glorious victory.
BASTARD:
How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
BASTARD:
Smacks it not something of the policy?
KING JOHN:
Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
KING JOHN:
I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers
KING JOHN:
And lay this Angiers even to the ground,
KING JOHN:
Then after fight who shall be king of it?
BASTARD:
An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
BASTARD:
Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,
BASTARD:
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
BASTARD:
As we will ours, against these saucy walls,
BASTARD:
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
BASTARD:
Why then defy each other and pell-mell
BASTARD:
Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.
KING PHILIP:
Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
KING JOHN:
We from the west will send destruction
KING JOHN:
Into this city's bosom.
AUSTRIA:
I from the north.
KING PHILIP:
Our thunder from the south
KING PHILIP:
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
BASTARD:
O prudent discipline! From north to south
BASTARD:
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth
BASTARD:
I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!
First Citizen:
Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
First Citizen:
And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league,
First Citizen:
Win you this city without stroke or wound,
First Citizen:
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
First Citizen:
That here come sacrifices for the field
First Citizen:
Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.
KING JOHN:
Speak on with favour, we are bent to hear.
First Citizen:
That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
First Citizen:
Is niece to England: look upon the years
First Citizen:
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid
First Citizen:
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
First Citizen:
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
First Citizen:
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
First Citizen:
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
First Citizen:
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
First Citizen:
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
First Citizen:
Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
First Citizen:
Is the young Dauphin every way complete
First Citizen:
If not complete of, say he is not she,
First Citizen:
And she again wants nothing, to name want,
First Citizen:
If want it be not that she is not he
First Citizen:
He is the half part of a blessed man,
First Citizen:
Left to be finished by such as she,
First Citizen:
And she a fair divided excellence,
First Citizen:
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
First Citizen:
O, two such silver currents, when they join,
First Citizen:
Do glorify the banks that bound them in,
First Citizen:
And two such shores to two such streams made one,
First Citizen:
Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
First Citizen:
To these two princes, if you marry them.
First Citizen:
This union shall do more than battery can
First Citizen:
To our fast-closed gates, for at this match,
First Citizen:
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
First Citizen:
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
First Citizen:
And give you entrance: but without this match,
First Citizen:
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
First Citizen:
Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
First Citizen:
More free from motion, no, not Death himself
First Citizen:
In moral fury half so peremptory,
First Citizen:
As we to keep this city.
BASTARD:
Here's a stay
BASTARD:
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
BASTARD:
Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
BASTARD:
That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
BASTARD:
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
BASTARD:
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
BASTARD:
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
BASTARD:
He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce,
BASTARD:
He gives the bastinado with his tongue
BASTARD:
Our ears are cudgell'd, not a word of his
BASTARD:
But buffets better than a fist of France
BASTARD:
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
BASTARD:
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Son, list to this conjunction, make this match,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Give with our niece a dowry large enough
QUEEN ELINOR:
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
QUEEN ELINOR:
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,
QUEEN ELINOR:
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
QUEEN ELINOR:
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
QUEEN ELINOR:
I see a yielding in the looks of France,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls
QUEEN ELINOR:
Are capable of this ambition,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
QUEEN ELINOR:
Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
QUEEN ELINOR:
Cool and congeal again to what it was.
First Citizen:
Why answer not the double majesties
First Citizen:
This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?
KING PHILIP:
Speak England first, that hath been forward first
KING PHILIP:
To speak unto this city: what say you?
KING JOHN:
If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
KING JOHN:
Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'
KING JOHN:
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
KING JOHN:
For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,
KING JOHN:
And all that we upon this side the sea,
KING JOHN:
Except this city now by us besieged,
KING JOHN:
Find liable to our crown and dignity,
KING JOHN:
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
KING JOHN:
In titles, honours and promotions,
KING JOHN:
As she in beauty, education, blood,
KING JOHN:
Holds hand with any princess of the world.
KING PHILIP:
What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.
LEWIS:
I do, my lord, and in her eye I find
LEWIS:
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
LEWIS:
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye
LEWIS:
Which being but the shadow of your son,
LEWIS:
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
LEWIS:
I do protest I never loved myself
LEWIS:
Till now infixed I beheld myself
LEWIS:
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
LEWIS:
Whispers with BLANCH
BASTARD:
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
BASTARD:
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
BASTARD:
And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy
BASTARD:
Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
BASTARD:
That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be
BASTARD:
In such a love so vile a lout as he.
BLANCH:
My uncle's will in this respect is mine
BLANCH:
If he see aught in you that makes him like,
BLANCH:
That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,
BLANCH:
I can with ease translate it to my will,
BLANCH:
Or if you will, to speak more properly,
BLANCH:
I will enforce it easily to my love.
BLANCH:
Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
BLANCH:
That all I see in you is worthy love,
BLANCH:
Than this, that nothing do I see in you,
BLANCH:
Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,
BLANCH:
That I can find should merit any hate.
KING JOHN:
What say these young ones? What say you my niece?
BLANCH:
That she is bound in honour still to do
BLANCH:
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
KING JOHN:
Speak then, prince Dauphin, can you love this lady?
LEWIS:
Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love,
LEWIS:
For I do love her most unfeignedly.
KING JOHN:
Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
KING JOHN:
Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,
KING JOHN:
With her to thee, and this addition more,
KING JOHN:
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
KING JOHN:
Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
KING JOHN:
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
KING PHILIP:
It likes us well, young princes, close your hands.
AUSTRIA:
And your lips too, for I am well assured
AUSTRIA:
That I did so when I was first assured.
KING PHILIP:
Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
KING PHILIP:
Let in that amity which you have made,
KING PHILIP:
For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
KING PHILIP:
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.
KING PHILIP:
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
KING PHILIP:
I know she is not, for this match made up
KING PHILIP:
Her presence would have interrupted much
KING PHILIP:
Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.
LEWIS:
She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.
KING PHILIP:
And, by my faith, this league that we have made
KING PHILIP:
Will give her sadness very little cure.
KING PHILIP:
Brother of England, how may we content
KING PHILIP:
This widow lady? In her right we came,
KING PHILIP:
Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,
KING PHILIP:
To our own vantage.
KING JOHN:
We will heal up all,
KING JOHN:
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
KING JOHN:
And Earl of Richmond, and this rich fair town
KING JOHN:
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance,
KING JOHN:
Some speedy messenger bid her repair
KING JOHN:
To our solemnity: I trust we shall,
KING JOHN:
If not fill up the measure of her will,
KING JOHN:
Yet in some measure satisfy her so
KING JOHN:
That we shall stop her exclamation.
KING JOHN:
Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
KING JOHN:
To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.
KING JOHN:
Exeunt all but the BASTARD
BASTARD:
Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
BASTARD:
John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
BASTARD:
Hath willingly departed with a part,
BASTARD:
And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
BASTARD:
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
BASTARD:
As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
BASTARD:
With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
BASTARD:
That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
BASTARD:
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
BASTARD:
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
BASTARD:
Who, having no external thing to lose
BASTARD:
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,
BASTARD:
That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
BASTARD:
Commodity, the bias of the world,
BASTARD:
The world, who of itself is peised well,
BASTARD:
Made to run even upon even ground,
BASTARD:
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
BASTARD:
This sway of motion, this Commodity,
BASTARD:
Makes it take head from all indifferency,
BASTARD:
From all direction, purpose, course, intent
BASTARD:
And this same bias, this Commodity,
BASTARD:
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
BASTARD:
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
BASTARD:
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
BASTARD:
From a resolved and honourable war,
BASTARD:
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
BASTARD:
And why rail I on this Commodity?
BASTARD:
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet
BASTARD:
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
BASTARD:
When his fair angels would salute my palm,
BASTARD:
But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
BASTARD:
Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
BASTARD:
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
BASTARD:
And say there is no sin but to be rich,
BASTARD:
And being rich, my virtue then shall be
BASTARD:
To say there is no vice but beggary.
BASTARD:
Since kings break faith upon commodity,
BASTARD:
Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.
BASTARD:
Exit
BASTARD:
ACT III
BASTARD:
SCENE I. The French King's pavilion.
BASTARD:
Enter CONSTANCE, ARTHUR, and SALISBURY
CONSTANCE:
Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
CONSTANCE:
False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!
CONSTANCE:
Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?
CONSTANCE:
It is not so, thou hast misspoke, misheard
CONSTANCE:
Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again
CONSTANCE:
It cannot be, thou dost but say 'tis so
CONSTANCE:
I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word
CONSTANCE:
Is but the vain breath of a common man
CONSTANCE:
Believe me, I do not believe thee, man,
CONSTANCE:
I have a king's oath to the contrary.
CONSTANCE:
Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
CONSTANCE:
For I am sick and capable of fears,
CONSTANCE:
Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
CONSTANCE:
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,
CONSTANCE:
A woman, naturally born to fears,
CONSTANCE:
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
CONSTANCE:
With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,
CONSTANCE:
But they will quake and tremble all this day.
CONSTANCE:
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
CONSTANCE:
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
CONSTANCE:
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
CONSTANCE:
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
CONSTANCE:
Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
CONSTANCE:
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
CONSTANCE:
Then speak again, not all thy former tale,
CONSTANCE:
But this one word, whether thy tale be true.
SALISBURY:
As true as I believe you think them false
SALISBURY:
That give you cause to prove my saying true.
CONSTANCE:
O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
CONSTANCE:
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,
CONSTANCE:
And let belief and life encounter so
CONSTANCE:
As doth the fury of two desperate men
CONSTANCE:
Which in the very meeting fall and die.
CONSTANCE:
Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?
CONSTANCE:
France friend with England, what becomes of me?
CONSTANCE:
Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight
CONSTANCE:
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.
SALISBURY:
What other harm have I, good lady, done,
SALISBURY:
But spoke the harm that is by others done?
CONSTANCE:
Which harm within itself so heinous is
CONSTANCE:
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.
ARTHUR:
I do beseech you, madam, be content.
CONSTANCE:
If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
CONSTANCE:
Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,
CONSTANCE:
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
CONSTANCE:
Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
CONSTANCE:
Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
CONSTANCE:
I would not care, I then would be content,
CONSTANCE:
For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou
CONSTANCE:
Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
CONSTANCE:
But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
CONSTANCE:
Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great
CONSTANCE:
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
CONSTANCE:
And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
CONSTANCE:
She is corrupted, changed and won from thee,
CONSTANCE:
She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,
CONSTANCE:
And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
CONSTANCE:
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
CONSTANCE:
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
CONSTANCE:
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
CONSTANCE:
That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
CONSTANCE:
Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
CONSTANCE:
Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
CONSTANCE:
And leave those woes alone which I alone
CONSTANCE:
Am bound to under-bear.
SALISBURY:
Pardon me, madam,
SALISBURY:
I may not go without you to the kings.
CONSTANCE:
Thou mayst, thou shalt, I will not go with thee
CONSTANCE:
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud,
CONSTANCE:
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
CONSTANCE:
To me and to the state of my great grief
CONSTANCE:
Let kings assemble, for my grief's so great
CONSTANCE:
That no supporter but the huge firm earth
CONSTANCE:
Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit,
CONSTANCE:
Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.
CONSTANCE:
Seats herself on the ground
CONSTANCE:
Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILLIP, LEWIS, BLANCH, QUEEN ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and Attendants
KING PHILIP:
'Tis true, fair daughter, and this blessed day
KING PHILIP:
Ever in France shall be kept festival
KING PHILIP:
To solemnize this day the glorious sun
KING PHILIP:
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
KING PHILIP:
Turning with splendor of his precious eye
KING PHILIP:
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
KING PHILIP:
The yearly course that brings this day about
KING PHILIP:
Shall never see it but a holiday.
CONSTANCE:
A wicked day, and not a holy day!
CONSTANCE:
Rising
CONSTANCE:
What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,
CONSTANCE:
That it in golden letters should be set
CONSTANCE:
Among the high tides in the calendar?
CONSTANCE:
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
CONSTANCE:
This day of shame, oppression, perjury.
CONSTANCE:
Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child
CONSTANCE:
Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,
CONSTANCE:
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd
CONSTANCE:
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck,
CONSTANCE:
No bargains break that are not this day made
CONSTANCE:
This day, all things begun come to ill end,
CONSTANCE:
Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!
KING PHILIP:
By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
KING PHILIP:
To curse the fair proceedings of this day
KING PHILIP:
Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?
CONSTANCE:
You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
CONSTANCE:
Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,
CONSTANCE:
Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn,
CONSTANCE:
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
CONSTANCE:
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours
CONSTANCE:
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
CONSTANCE:
Is cold in amity and painted peace,
CONSTANCE:
And our oppression hath made up this league.
CONSTANCE:
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!
CONSTANCE:
A widow cries, be husband to me, heavens!
CONSTANCE:
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
CONSTANCE:
Wear out the day in peace, but, ere sunset,
CONSTANCE:
Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!
CONSTANCE:
Hear me, O, hear me!
AUSTRIA:
Lady Constance, peace!
CONSTANCE:
War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war
CONSTANCE:
O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame
CONSTANCE:
That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
CONSTANCE:
Thou little valiant, great in villany!
CONSTANCE:
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
CONSTANCE:
Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
CONSTANCE:
But when her humorous ladyship is by
CONSTANCE:
To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,
CONSTANCE:
And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,
CONSTANCE:
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
CONSTANCE:
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
CONSTANCE:
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
CONSTANCE:
Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
CONSTANCE:
Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
CONSTANCE:
And dost thou now fall over to my fores?
CONSTANCE:
Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,
CONSTANCE:
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
AUSTRIA:
O, that a man should speak those words to me!
BASTARD:
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
AUSTRIA:
Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.
BASTARD:
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
KING JOHN:
We like not this, thou dost forget thyself.
KING JOHN:
Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH
KING PHILIP:
Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Do in his name religiously demand
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Why thou against the church, our holy mother,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
So wilfully dost spurn, and force perforce
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
This, in our foresaid holy father's name,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.
KING JOHN:
What earthy name to interrogatories
KING JOHN:
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
KING JOHN:
Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
KING JOHN:
So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,
KING JOHN:
To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
KING JOHN:
Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England
KING JOHN:
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
KING JOHN:
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions,
KING JOHN:
But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,
KING JOHN:
So under Him that great supremacy,
KING JOHN:
Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
KING JOHN:
Without the assistance of a mortal hand
KING JOHN:
So tell the pope, all reverence set apart
KING JOHN:
To him and his usurp'd authority.
KING PHILIP:
Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
KING JOHN:
Though you and all the kings of Christendom
KING JOHN:
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
KING JOHN:
Dreading the curse that money may buy out,
KING JOHN:
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
KING JOHN:
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
KING JOHN:
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
KING JOHN:
Though you and all the rest so grossly led
KING JOHN:
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
KING JOHN:
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
KING JOHN:
Against the pope and count his friends my foes.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Then, by the lawful power that I have,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
From his allegiance to an heretic,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Canonized and worshipped as a saint,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
That takes away by any secret course
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Thy hateful life.
CONSTANCE:
O, lawful let it be
CONSTANCE:
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
CONSTANCE:
Good father cardinal, cry thou amen
CONSTANCE:
To my keen curses, for without my wrong
CONSTANCE:
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
CONSTANCE:
And for mine too: when law can do no right,
CONSTANCE:
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
CONSTANCE:
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
CONSTANCE:
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law,
CONSTANCE:
Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
CONSTANCE:
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And raise the power of France upon his head,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
QUEEN ELINOR:
Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
CONSTANCE:
Look to that, devil, lest that France repent,
CONSTANCE:
And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.
AUSTRIA:
King Philip, listen to the cardinal.
BASTARD:
And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
AUSTRIA:
Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--
BASTARD:
Your breeches best may carry them.
KING JOHN:
Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?
CONSTANCE:
What should he say, but as the cardinal?
LEWIS:
Bethink you, father, for the difference
LEWIS:
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,
LEWIS:
Or the light loss of England for a friend
LEWIS:
Forego the easier.
BLANCH:
That's the curse of Rome.
CONSTANCE:
O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here
CONSTANCE:
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
BLANCH:
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
BLANCH:
But from her need.
CONSTANCE:
O, if thou grant my need,
CONSTANCE:
Which only lives but by the death of faith,
CONSTANCE:
That need must needs infer this principle,
CONSTANCE:
That faith would live again by death of need.
CONSTANCE:
O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up,
CONSTANCE:
Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
KING JOHN:
The king is moved, and answers not to this.
CONSTANCE:
O, be removed from him, and answer well!
AUSTRIA:
Do so, King Philip, hang no more in doubt.
BASTARD:
Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
KING PHILIP:
I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?
KING PHILIP:
Good reverend father, make my person yours,
KING PHILIP:
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
KING PHILIP:
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
KING PHILIP:
And the conjunction of our inward souls
KING PHILIP:
Married in league, coupled and linked together
KING PHILIP:
With all religious strength of sacred vows,
KING PHILIP:
The latest breath that gave the sound of words
KING PHILIP:
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
KING PHILIP:
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,
KING PHILIP:
And even before this truce, but new before,
KING PHILIP:
No longer than we well could wash our hands
KING PHILIP:
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
KING PHILIP:
Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd
KING PHILIP:
With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
KING PHILIP:
The fearful difference of incensed kings
KING PHILIP:
And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
KING PHILIP:
So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
KING PHILIP:
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
KING PHILIP:
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
KING PHILIP:
Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
KING PHILIP:
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
KING PHILIP:
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
KING PHILIP:
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
KING PHILIP:
And make a riot on the gentle brow
KING PHILIP:
Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
KING PHILIP:
My reverend father, let it not be so!
KING PHILIP:
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
KING PHILIP:
Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest
KING PHILIP:
To do your pleasure and continue friends.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
All form is formless, order orderless,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Save what is opposite to England's love.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
KING PHILIP:
I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
So makest thou faith an enemy to faith,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
That is, to be the champion of our church!
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And may not be performed by thyself,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Is not amiss when it is truly done,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
The truth is then most done not doing it
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
The better act of purposes mistook
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Is to mistake again, though indirect,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
It is religion that doth make vows kept,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
But thou hast sworn against religion,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
To swear, swears only not to be forsworn,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And better conquest never canst thou make
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Against these giddy loose suggestions
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Upon which better part our prayers come in,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
The peril of our curses light on thee
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
But in despair die under their black weight.
AUSTRIA:
Rebellion, flat rebellion!
BASTARD:
Will't not be?
BASTARD:
Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?
LEWIS:
Father, to arms!
BLANCH:
Upon thy wedding-day?
BLANCH:
Against the blood that thou hast married?
BLANCH:
What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?
BLANCH:
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
BLANCH:
Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?
BLANCH:
O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new
BLANCH:
Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,
BLANCH:
Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,
BLANCH:
Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
BLANCH:
Against mine uncle.
CONSTANCE:
O, upon my knee,
CONSTANCE:
Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
CONSTANCE:
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
CONSTANCE:
Forethought by heaven!
BLANCH:
Now shall I see thy love: what motive may
BLANCH:
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?
CONSTANCE:
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
CONSTANCE:
His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!
LEWIS:
I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,
LEWIS:
When such profound respects do pull you on.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
I will denounce a curse upon his head.
KING PHILIP:
Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.
CONSTANCE:
O fair return of banish'd majesty!
QUEEN ELINOR:
O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
KING JOHN:
France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
BASTARD:
Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
BASTARD:
Is it as he will? well then, France shall rue.
BLANCH:
The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!
BLANCH:
Which is the side that I must go withal?
BLANCH:
I am with both: each army hath a hand,
BLANCH:
And in their rage, I having hold of both,
BLANCH:
They swirl asunder and dismember me.
BLANCH:
Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win,
BLANCH:
Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose,
BLANCH:
Father, I may not wish the fortune thine,
BLANCH:
Grandam, I will not wish thy fortunes thrive
BLANCH:
Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose
BLANCH:
Assured loss before the match be play'd.
LEWIS:
Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
BLANCH:
There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
KING JOHN:
Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
KING JOHN:
Exit BASTARD
KING JOHN:
France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath,
KING JOHN:
A rage whose heat hath this condition,
KING JOHN:
That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,
KING JOHN:
The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.
KING PHILIP:
Thy rage sham burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
KING PHILIP:
To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire
KING PHILIP:
Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.
KING JOHN:
No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!
KING JOHN:
Exeunt
KING JOHN:
SCENE II. The same. Plains near Angiers.
KING JOHN:
Alarums, excursions. Enter the BASTARD, with AUSTRIA'S head
BASTARD:
Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot,
BASTARD:
Some airy devil hovers in the sky
BASTARD:
And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,
BASTARD:
While Philip breathes.
BASTARD:
Enter KING JOHN, ARTHUR, and HUBERT
KING JOHN:
Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up
KING JOHN:
My mother is assailed in our tent,
KING JOHN:
And ta'en, I fear.
BASTARD:
My lord, I rescued her,
BASTARD:
Her highness is in safety, fear you not
BASTARD:
But on, my liege, for very little pains
BASTARD:
Will bring this labour to an happy end.
BASTARD:
Exeunt
BASTARD:
SCENE III. The same.
BASTARD:
Alarums, excursions, retreat. Enter KING JOHN,  QUEEN ELINOR, ARTHUR, the BASTARD, HUBERT, and Lords
KING JOHN:
[To QUEEN ELINOR]  So shall it be, your grace shall
KING JOHN:
stay behind
KING JOHN:
So strongly guarded.
KING JOHN:
To ARTHUR
KING JOHN:
Cousin, look not sad
KING JOHN:
Thy grandam loves thee, and thy uncle will
KING JOHN:
As dear be to thee as thy father was.
ARTHUR:
O, this will make my mother die with grief!
KING JOHN:
[To the BASTARD]  Cousin, away for England!
KING JOHN:
haste before
KING JOHN:
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
KING JOHN:
Of hoarding abbots, imprisoned angels
KING JOHN:
Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace
KING JOHN:
Must by the hungry now be fed upon
KING JOHN:
Use our commission in his utmost force.
BASTARD:
Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,
BASTARD:
When gold and silver becks me to come on.
BASTARD:
I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,
BASTARD:
If ever I remember to be holy,
BASTARD:
For your fair safety, so, I kiss your hand.
ELINOR:
Farewell, gentle cousin.
KING JOHN:
Coz, farewell.
KING JOHN:
Exit the BASTARD
QUEEN ELINOR:
Come hither, little kinsman, hark, a word.
KING JOHN:
Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
KING JOHN:
We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh
KING JOHN:
There is a soul counts thee her creditor
KING JOHN:
And with advantage means to pay thy love
KING JOHN:
And my good friend, thy voluntary oath
KING JOHN:
Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
KING JOHN:
Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,
KING JOHN:
But I will fit it with some better time.
KING JOHN:
By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed
KING JOHN:
To say what good respect I have of thee.
HUBERT:
I am much bounden to your majesty.
KING JOHN:
Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
KING JOHN:
But thou shalt have, and creep time ne'er so slow,
KING JOHN:
Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.
KING JOHN:
I had a thing to say, but let it go
KING JOHN:
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
KING JOHN:
Attended with the pleasures of the world,
KING JOHN:
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
KING JOHN:
To give me audience: if the midnight bell
KING JOHN:
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
KING JOHN:
Sound on into the drowsy race of night,
KING JOHN:
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
KING JOHN:
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,
KING JOHN:
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
KING JOHN:
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
KING JOHN:
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
KING JOHN:
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
KING JOHN:
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
KING JOHN:
A passion hateful to my purposes,
KING JOHN:
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
KING JOHN:
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
KING JOHN:
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
KING JOHN:
Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words,
KING JOHN:
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
KING JOHN:
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts
KING JOHN:
But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well,
KING JOHN:
And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.
HUBERT:
So well, that what you bid me undertake,
HUBERT:
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
HUBERT:
By heaven, I would do it.
KING JOHN:
Do not I know thou wouldst?
KING JOHN:
Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
KING JOHN:
On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
KING JOHN:
He is a very serpent in my way,
KING JOHN:
And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,
KING JOHN:
He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
KING JOHN:
Thou art his keeper.
HUBERT:
And I'll keep him so,
HUBERT:
That he shall not offend your majesty.
KING JOHN:
Death.
HUBERT:
My lord?
KING JOHN:
A grave.
HUBERT:
He shall not live.
KING JOHN:
Enough.
KING JOHN:
I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee,
KING JOHN:
Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee
KING JOHN:
Remember. Madam, fare you well
KING JOHN:
I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.
ELINOR:
My blessing go with thee!
KING JOHN:
For England, cousin, go
KING JOHN:
Hubert shall be your man, attend on you
KING JOHN:
With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!
KING JOHN:
Exeunt
KING JOHN:
SCENE IV. The same. KING PHILIP'S tent.
KING JOHN:
Enter KING PHILIP, LEWIS, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants
KING PHILIP:
So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
KING PHILIP:
A whole armado of convicted sail
KING PHILIP:
Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.
KING PHILIP:
What can go well, when we have run so ill?
KING PHILIP:
Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
KING PHILIP:
Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?
KING PHILIP:
And bloody England into England gone,
KING PHILIP:
O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?
LEWIS:
What he hath won, that hath he fortified
LEWIS:
So hot a speed with such advice disposed,
LEWIS:
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
LEWIS:
Doth want example: who hath read or heard
LEWIS:
Of any kindred action like to this?
KING PHILIP:
Well could I bear that England had this praise,
KING PHILIP:
So we could find some pattern of our shame.
KING PHILIP:
Enter CONSTANCE
KING PHILIP:
Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul,
KING PHILIP:
Holding the eternal spirit against her will,
KING PHILIP:
In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
KING PHILIP:
I prithee, lady, go away with me.
CONSTANCE:
Lo, now I now see the issue of your peace.
KING PHILIP:
Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!
CONSTANCE:
No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
CONSTANCE:
But that which ends all counsel, true redress,
CONSTANCE:
Death, death, O amiable lovely death!
CONSTANCE:
Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!
CONSTANCE:
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
CONSTANCE:
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
CONSTANCE:
And I will kiss thy detestable bones
CONSTANCE:
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
CONSTANCE:
And ring these fingers with thy household worms
CONSTANCE:
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
CONSTANCE:
And be a carrion monster like thyself
CONSTANCE:
Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest
CONSTANCE:
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,
CONSTANCE:
O, come to me!
KING PHILIP:
O fair affliction, peace!
CONSTANCE:
No, no, I will not, having breath to cry
CONSTANCE:
O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
CONSTANCE:
Then with a passion would I shake the world,
CONSTANCE:
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
CONSTANCE:
Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,
CONSTANCE:
Which scorns a modern invocation.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.
CONSTANCE:
Thou art not holy to belie me so,
CONSTANCE:
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine,
CONSTANCE:
My name is Constance, I was Geffrey's wife,
CONSTANCE:
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost
CONSTANCE:
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
CONSTANCE:
For then, 'tis like I should forget myself
CONSTANCE:
O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
CONSTANCE:
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
CONSTANCE:
And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal,
CONSTANCE:
For being not mad but sensible of grief,
CONSTANCE:
My reasonable part produces reason
CONSTANCE:
How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
CONSTANCE:
And teaches me to kill or hang myself
CONSTANCE:
If I were mad, I should forget my son,
CONSTANCE:
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he
CONSTANCE:
I am not mad, too well, too well I feel
CONSTANCE:
The different plague of each calamity.
KING PHILIP:
Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
KING PHILIP:
In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
KING PHILIP:
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,
KING PHILIP:
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
KING PHILIP:
Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
KING PHILIP:
Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
KING PHILIP:
Sticking together in calamity.
CONSTANCE:
To England, if you will.
KING PHILIP:
Bind up your hairs.
CONSTANCE:
Yes, that I will, and wherefore will I do it?
CONSTANCE:
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
CONSTANCE:
'O that these hands could so redeem my son,
CONSTANCE:
As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
CONSTANCE:
But now I envy at their liberty,
CONSTANCE:
And will again commit them to their bonds,
CONSTANCE:
Because my poor child is a prisoner.
CONSTANCE:
And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
CONSTANCE:
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven
CONSTANCE:
If that be true, I shall see my boy again,
CONSTANCE:
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
CONSTANCE:
To him that did but yesterday suspire,
CONSTANCE:
There was not such a gracious creature born.
CONSTANCE:
But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
CONSTANCE:
And chase the native beauty from his cheek
CONSTANCE:
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
CONSTANCE:
As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,
CONSTANCE:
And so he'll die, and, rising so again,
CONSTANCE:
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
CONSTANCE:
I shall not know him: therefore never, never
CONSTANCE:
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
CONSTANCE:
He talks to me that never had a son.
KING PHILIP:
You are as fond of grief as of your child.
CONSTANCE:
Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
CONSTANCE:
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
CONSTANCE:
Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
CONSTANCE:
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
CONSTANCE:
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form,
CONSTANCE:
Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?
CONSTANCE:
Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,
CONSTANCE:
I could give better comfort than you do.
CONSTANCE:
I will not keep this form upon my head,
CONSTANCE:
When there is such disorder in my wit.
CONSTANCE:
O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
CONSTANCE:
My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!
CONSTANCE:
My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!
CONSTANCE:
Exit
KING PHILIP:
I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.
KING PHILIP:
Exit
LEWIS:
There's nothing in this world can make me joy
LEWIS:
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
LEWIS:
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man,
LEWIS:
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
LEWIS:
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Before the curing of a strong disease,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Even in the instant of repair and health,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
The fit is strongest, evils that take leave,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
On their departure most of all show evil
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
What have you lost by losing of this day?
LEWIS:
All days of glory, joy and happiness.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
If you had won it, certainly you had.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
No, no, when Fortune means to men most good,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
She looks upon them with a threatening eye.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
In this which he accounts so clearly won
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?
LEWIS:
As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
For even the breath of what I mean to speak
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Out of the path which shall directly lead
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Thy foot to England's throne, and therefore mark.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
John hath seized Arthur, and it cannot be
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
The misplaced John should entertain an hour,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And he that stands upon a slippery place
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
So be it, for it cannot be but so.
LEWIS:
But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
LEWIS:
And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
How green you are and fresh in this old world!
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
John lays you plots, the times conspire with you,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
That none so small advantage shall step forth
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
No natural exhalation in the sky,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
No common wind, no customed event,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
But they will pluck away his natural cause
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
LEWIS:
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
LEWIS:
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
If that young Arthur be not gone already,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Even at that news he dies, and then the hearts
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Of all his people shall revolt from him
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And, O, what better matter breeds for you
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Is now in England, ransacking the church,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Offending charity: if but a dozen French
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Were there in arms, they would be as a call
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
To train ten thousand English to their side,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
What may be wrought out of their discontent,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Now that their souls are topful of offence.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
For England go: I will whet on the king.
LEWIS:
Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go
LEWIS:
If you say ay, the king will not say no.
LEWIS:
Exeunt
LEWIS:
ACT IV
LEWIS:
SCENE I. A room in a castle.
LEWIS:
Enter HUBERT and Executioners
HUBERT:
Heat me these irons hot, and look thou stand
HUBERT:
Within the arras: when I strike my foot
HUBERT:
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,
HUBERT:
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
HUBERT:
Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.
First Executioner:
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
HUBERT:
Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.
HUBERT:
Exeunt Executioners
HUBERT:
Young lad, come forth, I have to say with you.
HUBERT:
Enter ARTHUR
ARTHUR:
Good morrow, Hubert.
HUBERT:
Good morrow, little prince.
ARTHUR:
As little prince, having so great a title
ARTHUR:
To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.
HUBERT:
Indeed, I have been merrier.
ARTHUR:
Mercy on me!
ARTHUR:
Methinks no body should be sad but I
ARTHUR:
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
ARTHUR:
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
ARTHUR:
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
ARTHUR:
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
ARTHUR:
I should be as merry as the day is long,
ARTHUR:
And so I would be here, but that I doubt
ARTHUR:
My uncle practises more harm to me
ARTHUR:
He is afraid of me and I of him
ARTHUR:
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
ARTHUR:
No, indeed, is't not, and I would to heaven
ARTHUR:
I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.
HUBERT:
[Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
HUBERT:
He will awake my mercy which lies dead
HUBERT:
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
ARTHUR:
Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day
ARTHUR:
In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
ARTHUR:
That I might sit all night and watch with you
ARTHUR:
I warrant I love you more than you do me.
HUBERT:
[Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.
HUBERT:
Read here, young Arthur.
HUBERT:
Showing a paper
HUBERT:
Aside
HUBERT:
How now, foolish rheum!
HUBERT:
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
HUBERT:
I must be brief, lest resolution drop
HUBERT:
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
HUBERT:
Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
ARTHUR:
Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect
ARTHUR:
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
HUBERT:
Young boy, I must.
ARTHUR:
And will you?
HUBERT:
And I will.
ARTHUR:
Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
ARTHUR:
I knit my handercher about your brows,
ARTHUR:
The best I had, a princess wrought it me,
ARTHUR:
And I did never ask it you again,
ARTHUR:
And with my hand at midnight held your head,
ARTHUR:
And like the watchful minutes to the hour,
ARTHUR:
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
ARTHUR:
Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'
ARTHUR:
Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
ARTHUR:
Many a poor man's son would have lien still
ARTHUR:
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you,
ARTHUR:
But you at your sick service had a prince.
ARTHUR:
Nay, you may think my love was crafty love
ARTHUR:
And call it cunning: do, an if you will
ARTHUR:
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,
ARTHUR:
Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
ARTHUR:
These eyes that never did nor never shall
ARTHUR:
So much as frown on you.
HUBERT:
I have sworn to do it,
HUBERT:
And with hot irons must I burn them out.
ARTHUR:
Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
ARTHUR:
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
ARTHUR:
Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears
ARTHUR:
And quench his fiery indignation
ARTHUR:
Even in the matter of mine innocence,
ARTHUR:
Nay, after that, consume away in rust
ARTHUR:
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
ARTHUR:
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?
ARTHUR:
An if an angel should have come to me
ARTHUR:
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
ARTHUR:
I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.
HUBERT:
Come forth.
HUBERT:
Stamps
HUBERT:
Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons,  and c
HUBERT:
Do as I bid you do.
ARTHUR:
O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out
ARTHUR:
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
HUBERT:
Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
ARTHUR:
Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?
ARTHUR:
I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.
ARTHUR:
For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
ARTHUR:
Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,
ARTHUR:
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb,
ARTHUR:
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,
ARTHUR:
Nor look upon the iron angerly
ARTHUR:
Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,
ARTHUR:
Whatever torment you do put me to.
HUBERT:
Go, stand within, let me alone with him.
First Executioner:
I am best pleased to be from such a deed.
First Executioner:
Exeunt Executioners
ARTHUR:
Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
ARTHUR:
He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart
ARTHUR:
Let him come back, that his compassion may
ARTHUR:
Give life to yours.
HUBERT:
Come, boy, prepare yourself.
ARTHUR:
Is there no remedy?
HUBERT:
None, but to lose your eyes.
ARTHUR:
O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
ARTHUR:
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
ARTHUR:
Any annoyance in that precious sense!
ARTHUR:
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,
ARTHUR:
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
HUBERT:
Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.
ARTHUR:
Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
ARTHUR:
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
ARTHUR:
Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert,
ARTHUR:
Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
ARTHUR:
So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.
ARTHUR:
Though to no use but still to look on you!
ARTHUR:
Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold
ARTHUR:
And would not harm me.
HUBERT:
I can heat it, boy.
ARTHUR:
No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,
ARTHUR:
Being create for comfort, to be used
ARTHUR:
In undeserved extremes: see else yourself,
ARTHUR:
There is no malice in this burning coal,
ARTHUR:
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
ARTHUR:
And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.
HUBERT:
But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
ARTHUR:
An if you do, you will but make it blush
ARTHUR:
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert
ARTHUR:
Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes,
ARTHUR:
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
ARTHUR:
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
ARTHUR:
All things that you should use to do me wrong
ARTHUR:
Deny their office: only you do lack
ARTHUR:
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,
ARTHUR:
Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.
HUBERT:
Well, see to live, I will not touch thine eye
HUBERT:
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes
HUBERT:
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
HUBERT:
With this same very iron to burn them out.
ARTHUR:
O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
ARTHUR:
You were disguised.
HUBERT:
Peace, no more. Adieu.
HUBERT:
Your uncle must not know but you are dead,
HUBERT:
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports
HUBERT:
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,
HUBERT:
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
HUBERT:
Will not offend thee.
ARTHUR:
O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.
HUBERT:
Silence, no more: go closely in with me
HUBERT:
Much danger do I undergo for thee.
HUBERT:
Exeunt
HUBERT:
SCENE II. KING JOHN'S palace.
HUBERT:
Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords
KING JOHN:
Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
KING JOHN:
And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
PEMBROKE:
This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,
PEMBROKE:
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
PEMBROKE:
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
PEMBROKE:
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt,
PEMBROKE:
Fresh expectation troubled not the land
PEMBROKE:
With any long'd-for change or better state.
SALISBURY:
Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
SALISBURY:
To guard a title that was rich before,
SALISBURY:
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
SALISBURY:
To throw a perfume on the violet,
SALISBURY:
To smooth the ice, or add another hue
SALISBURY:
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
SALISBURY:
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
SALISBURY:
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
PEMBROKE:
But that your royal pleasure must be done,
PEMBROKE:
This act is as an ancient tale new told,
PEMBROKE:
And in the last repeating troublesome,
PEMBROKE:
Being urged at a time unseasonable.
SALISBURY:
In this the antique and well noted face
SALISBURY:
Of plain old form is much disfigured,
SALISBURY:
And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,
SALISBURY:
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
SALISBURY:
Startles and frights consideration,
SALISBURY:
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,
SALISBURY:
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
PEMBROKE:
When workmen strive to do better than well,
PEMBROKE:
They do confound their skill in covetousness,
PEMBROKE:
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
PEMBROKE:
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
PEMBROKE:
As patches set upon a little breach
PEMBROKE:
Discredit more in hiding of the fault
PEMBROKE:
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
SALISBURY:
To this effect, before you were new crown'd,
SALISBURY:
We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness
SALISBURY:
To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,
SALISBURY:
Since all and every part of what we would
SALISBURY:
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
KING JOHN:
Some reasons of this double coronation
KING JOHN:
I have possess'd you with and think them strong,
KING JOHN:
And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,
KING JOHN:
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
KING JOHN:
What you would have reform'd that is not well,
KING JOHN:
And well shall you perceive how willingly
KING JOHN:
I will both hear and grant you your requests.
PEMBROKE:
Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
PEMBROKE:
To sound the purpose of all their hearts,
PEMBROKE:
Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,
PEMBROKE:
Your safety, for the which myself and them
PEMBROKE:
Bend their best studies, heartily request
PEMBROKE:
The enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint
PEMBROKE:
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
PEMBROKE:
To break into this dangerous argument,--
PEMBROKE:
If what in rest you have in right you hold,
PEMBROKE:
Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend
PEMBROKE:
The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
PEMBROKE:
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
PEMBROKE:
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
PEMBROKE:
The rich advantage of good exercise?
PEMBROKE:
That the time's enemies may not have this
PEMBROKE:
To grace occasions, let it be our suit
PEMBROKE:
That you have bid us ask his liberty,
PEMBROKE:
Which for our goods we do no further ask
PEMBROKE:
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
PEMBROKE:
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
PEMBROKE:
Enter HUBERT
KING JOHN:
Let it be so: I do commit his youth
KING JOHN:
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?
KING JOHN:
Taking him apart
PEMBROKE:
This is the man should do the bloody deed,
PEMBROKE:
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine
PEMBROKE:
The image of a wicked heinous fault
PEMBROKE:
Lives in his eye, that close aspect of his
PEMBROKE:
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast,
PEMBROKE:
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
PEMBROKE:
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
SALISBURY:
The colour of the king doth come and go
SALISBURY:
Between his purpose and his conscience,
SALISBURY:
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set
SALISBURY:
His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.
PEMBROKE:
And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
PEMBROKE:
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
KING JOHN:
We cannot hold mortality's strong hand
KING JOHN:
Good lords, although my will to give is living,
KING JOHN:
The suit which you demand is gone and dead
KING JOHN:
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.
SALISBURY:
Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
PEMBROKE:
Indeed we heard how near his death he was
PEMBROKE:
Before the child himself felt he was sick
PEMBROKE:
This must be answer'd either here or hence.
KING JOHN:
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
KING JOHN:
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
KING JOHN:
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
SALISBURY:
It is apparent foul play, and 'tis shame
SALISBURY:
That greatness should so grossly offer it
SALISBURY:
So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
PEMBROKE:
Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'll go with thee,
PEMBROKE:
And find the inheritance of this poor child,
PEMBROKE:
His little kingdom of a forced grave.
PEMBROKE:
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,
PEMBROKE:
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
PEMBROKE:
This must not be thus borne: this will break out
PEMBROKE:
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.
PEMBROKE:
Exeunt Lords
KING JOHN:
They burn in indignation. I repent
KING JOHN:
There is no sure foundation set on blood,
KING JOHN:
No certain life achieved by others' death.
KING JOHN:
Enter a Messenger
KING JOHN:
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
KING JOHN:
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
KING JOHN:
So foul a sky clears not without a storm
KING JOHN:
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?
Messenger:
From France to England. Never such a power
Messenger:
For any foreign preparation
Messenger:
Was levied in the body of a land.
Messenger:
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them,
Messenger:
For when you should be told they do prepare,
Messenger:
The tidings come that they are all arrived.
KING JOHN:
O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
KING JOHN:
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,
KING JOHN:
That such an army could be drawn in France,
KING JOHN:
And she not hear of it?
Messenger:
My liege, her ear
Messenger:
Is stopp'd with dust, the first of April died
Messenger:
Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,
Messenger:
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
Messenger:
Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
Messenger:
I idly heard, if true or false I know not.
KING JOHN:
Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
KING JOHN:
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
KING JOHN:
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
KING JOHN:
How wildly then walks my estate in France!
KING JOHN:
Under whose conduct came those powers of France
KING JOHN:
That thou for truth givest out are landed here?
Messenger:
Under the Dauphin.
KING JOHN:
Thou hast made me giddy
KING JOHN:
With these ill tidings.
KING JOHN:
Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret
KING JOHN:
Now, what says the world
KING JOHN:
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
KING JOHN:
My head with more ill news, for it is full.
BASTARD:
But if you be afeard to hear the worst,
BASTARD:
Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.
KING JOHN:
Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed
KING JOHN:
Under the tide: but now I breathe again
KING JOHN:
Aloft the flood, and can give audience
KING JOHN:
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.
BASTARD:
How I have sped among the clergymen,
BASTARD:
The sums I have collected shall express.
BASTARD:
But as I travell'd hither through the land,
BASTARD:
I find the people strangely fantasied,
BASTARD:
Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,
BASTARD:
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear
BASTARD:
And here a prophet, that I brought with me
BASTARD:
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
BASTARD:
With many hundreds treading on his heels,
BASTARD:
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
BASTARD:
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
BASTARD:
Your highness should deliver up your crown.
KING JOHN:
Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
PETER:
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
KING JOHN:
Hubert, away with him, imprison him,
KING JOHN:
And on that day at noon whereon he says
KING JOHN:
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.
KING JOHN:
Deliver him to safety, and return,
KING JOHN:
For I must use thee.
KING JOHN:
Exeunt HUBERT with PETER
KING JOHN:
O my gentle cousin,
KING JOHN:
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
BASTARD:
The French, my lord, men's mouths are full of it
BASTARD:
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
BASTARD:
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
BASTARD:
And others more, going to seek the grave
BASTARD:
Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night
BASTARD:
On your suggestion.
KING JOHN:
Gentle kinsman, go,
KING JOHN:
And thrust thyself into their companies
KING JOHN:
I have a way to win their loves again,
KING JOHN:
Bring them before me.
BASTARD:
I will seek them out.
KING JOHN:
Nay, but make haste, the better foot before.
KING JOHN:
O, let me have no subject enemies,
KING JOHN:
When adverse foreigners affright my towns
KING JOHN:
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
KING JOHN:
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
KING JOHN:
And fly like thought from them to me again.
BASTARD:
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
BASTARD:
Exit
KING JOHN:
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
KING JOHN:
Go after him, for he perhaps shall need
KING JOHN:
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers,
KING JOHN:
And be thou he.
Messenger:
With all my heart, my liege.
Messenger:
Exit
KING JOHN:
My mother dead!
KING JOHN:
Re-enter HUBERT
HUBERT:
My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night,
HUBERT:
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
HUBERT:
The other four in wondrous motion.
KING JOHN:
Five moons!
HUBERT:
Old men and beldams in the streets
HUBERT:
Do prophesy upon it dangerously
HUBERT:
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths
HUBERT:
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
HUBERT:
And whisper one another in the ear,
HUBERT:
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
HUBERT:
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
HUBERT:
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
HUBERT:
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
HUBERT:
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
HUBERT:
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news,
HUBERT:
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
HUBERT:
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
HUBERT:
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
HUBERT:
Told of a many thousand warlike French
HUBERT:
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent
HUBERT:
Another lean unwash'd artificer
HUBERT:
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
KING JOHN:
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
KING JOHN:
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
KING JOHN:
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
KING JOHN:
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
HUBERT:
No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?
KING JOHN:
It is the curse of kings to be attended
KING JOHN:
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
KING JOHN:
To break within the bloody house of life,
KING JOHN:
And on the winking of authority
KING JOHN:
To understand a law, to know the meaning
KING JOHN:
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
KING JOHN:
More upon humour than advised respect.
HUBERT:
Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
KING JOHN:
O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
KING JOHN:
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
KING JOHN:
Witness against us to damnation!
KING JOHN:
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
KING JOHN:
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
KING JOHN:
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
KING JOHN:
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
KING JOHN:
This murder had not come into my mind
KING JOHN:
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
KING JOHN:
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
KING JOHN:
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
KING JOHN:
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death,
KING JOHN:
And thou, to be endeared to a king,
KING JOHN:
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
HUBERT:
My lord--
KING JOHN:
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
KING JOHN:
When I spake darkly what I purposed,
KING JOHN:
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
KING JOHN:
As bid me tell my tale in express words,
KING JOHN:
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
KING JOHN:
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
KING JOHN:
But thou didst understand me by my signs
KING JOHN:
And didst in signs again parley with sin,
KING JOHN:
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
KING JOHN:
And consequently thy rude hand to act
KING JOHN:
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
KING JOHN:
Out of my sight, and never see me more!
KING JOHN:
My nobles leave me, and my state is braved,
KING JOHN:
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers
KING JOHN:
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
KING JOHN:
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
KING JOHN:
Hostility and civil tumult reigns
KING JOHN:
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
HUBERT:
Arm you against your other enemies,
HUBERT:
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
HUBERT:
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
HUBERT:
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
HUBERT:
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
HUBERT:
Within this bosom never enter'd yet
HUBERT:
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought,
HUBERT:
And you have slander'd nature in my form,
HUBERT:
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
HUBERT:
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
HUBERT:
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
KING JOHN:
Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
KING JOHN:
Throw this report on their incensed rage,
KING JOHN:
And make them tame to their obedience!
KING JOHN:
Forgive the comment that my passion made
KING JOHN:
Upon thy feature, for my rage was blind,
KING JOHN:
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
KING JOHN:
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
KING JOHN:
O, answer not, but to my closet bring
KING JOHN:
The angry lords with all expedient haste.
KING JOHN:
I conjure thee but slowly, run more fast.
KING JOHN:
Exeunt
KING JOHN:
SCENE III. Before the castle.
KING JOHN:
Enter ARTHUR, on the walls
ARTHUR:
The wall is high, and yet will I leap down
ARTHUR:
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
ARTHUR:
There's few or none do know me: if they did,
ARTHUR:
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
ARTHUR:
I am afraid, and yet I'll venture it.
ARTHUR:
If I get down, and do not break my limbs,
ARTHUR:
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away
ARTHUR:
As good to die and go, as die and stay.
ARTHUR:
Leaps down
ARTHUR:
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones
ARTHUR:
Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!
ARTHUR:
Dies
ARTHUR:
Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT
SALISBURY:
Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury
SALISBURY:
It is our safety, and we must embrace
SALISBURY:
This gentle offer of the perilous time.
PEMBROKE:
Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
SALISBURY:
The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
SALISBURY:
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
SALISBURY:
Is much more general than these lines import.
BIGOT:
To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
SALISBURY:
Or rather then set forward, for 'twill be
SALISBURY:
Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.
SALISBURY:
Enter the BASTARD
BASTARD:
Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
BASTARD:
The king by me requests your presence straight.
SALISBURY:
The king hath dispossess'd himself of us
SALISBURY:
We will not line his thin bestained cloak
SALISBURY:
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
SALISBURY:
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
SALISBURY:
Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
BASTARD:
Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
SALISBURY:
Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
BASTARD:
But there is little reason in your grief,
BASTARD:
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
PEMBROKE:
Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
BASTARD:
'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.
SALISBURY:
This is the prison. What is he lies here?
SALISBURY:
Seeing ARTHUR
PEMBROKE:
O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
PEMBROKE:
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
SALISBURY:
Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
SALISBURY:
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
BIGOT:
Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
BIGOT:
Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
SALISBURY:
Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
SALISBURY:
Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
SALISBURY:
Or do you almost think, although you see,
SALISBURY:
That you do see? could thought, without this object,
SALISBURY:
Form such another? This is the very top,
SALISBURY:
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
SALISBURY:
Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
SALISBURY:
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
SALISBURY:
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
SALISBURY:
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
PEMBROKE:
All murders past do stand excused in this
PEMBROKE:
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
PEMBROKE:
Shall give a holiness, a purity,
PEMBROKE:
To the yet unbegotten sin of times,
PEMBROKE:
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
PEMBROKE:
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.
BASTARD:
It is a damned and a bloody work,
BASTARD:
The graceless action of a heavy hand,
BASTARD:
If that it be the work of any hand.
SALISBURY:
If that it be the work of any hand!
SALISBURY:
We had a kind of light what would ensue
SALISBURY:
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand,
SALISBURY:
The practise and the purpose of the king
SALISBURY:
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
SALISBURY:
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
SALISBURY:
And breathing to his breathless excellence
SALISBURY:
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
SALISBURY:
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
SALISBURY:
Never to be infected with delight,
SALISBURY:
Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
SALISBURY:
Till I have set a glory to this hand,
SALISBURY:
By giving it the worship of revenge.
BIGOT:
Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
BIGOT:
Enter HUBERT
HUBERT:
Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you
HUBERT:
Arthur doth live, the king hath sent for you.
SALISBURY:
O, he is old and blushes not at death.
SALISBURY:
Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!
HUBERT:
I am no villain.
SALISBURY:
Must I rob the law?
SALISBURY:
Drawing his sword
BASTARD:
Your sword is bright, sir, put it up again.
SALISBURY:
Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
HUBERT:
Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say,
HUBERT:
By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours
HUBERT:
I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
HUBERT:
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence,
HUBERT:
Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
HUBERT:
Your worth, your greatness and nobility.
BIGOT:
Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?
HUBERT:
Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
HUBERT:
My innocent life against an emperor.
SALISBURY:
Thou art a murderer.
HUBERT:
Do not prove me so,
HUBERT:
Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
HUBERT:
Not truly speaks, who speaks not truly, lies.
PEMBROKE:
Cut him to pieces.
BASTARD:
Keep the peace, I say.
SALISBURY:
Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
BASTARD:
Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury
BASTARD:
If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
BASTARD:
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
BASTARD:
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime,
BASTARD:
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
BASTARD:
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.
BIGOT:
What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
BIGOT:
Second a villain and a murderer?
HUBERT:
Lord Bigot, I am none.
BIGOT:
Who kill'd this prince?
HUBERT:
'Tis not an hour since I left him well
HUBERT:
I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep
HUBERT:
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
SALISBURY:
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
SALISBURY:
For villany is not without such rheum,
SALISBURY:
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
SALISBURY:
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
SALISBURY:
Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
SALISBURY:
The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house,
SALISBURY:
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
BIGOT:
Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
PEMBROKE:
There tell the king he may inquire us out.
PEMBROKE:
Exeunt Lords
BASTARD:
Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
BASTARD:
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
BASTARD:
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
BASTARD:
Art thou damn'd, Hubert.
HUBERT:
Do but hear me, sir.
BASTARD:
Ha! I'll tell thee what,
BASTARD:
Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black,
BASTARD:
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer
BASTARD:
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
BASTARD:
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.
HUBERT:
Upon my soul--
BASTARD:
If thou didst but consent
BASTARD:
To this most cruel act, do but despair,
BASTARD:
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
BASTARD:
That ever spider twisted from her womb
BASTARD:
Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam
BASTARD:
To hang thee on, or wouldst thou drown thyself,
BASTARD:
Put but a little water in a spoon,
BASTARD:
And it shall be as all the ocean,
BASTARD:
Enough to stifle such a villain up.
BASTARD:
I do suspect thee very grievously.
HUBERT:
If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
HUBERT:
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
HUBERT:
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
HUBERT:
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
HUBERT:
I left him well.
BASTARD:
Go, bear him in thine arms.
BASTARD:
I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
BASTARD:
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
BASTARD:
How easy dost thou take all England up!
BASTARD:
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
BASTARD:
The life, the right and truth of all this realm
BASTARD:
Is fled to heaven, and England now is left
BASTARD:
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
BASTARD:
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
BASTARD:
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
BASTARD:
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
BASTARD:
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
BASTARD:
Now powers from home and discontents at home
BASTARD:
Meet in one line, and vast confusion waits,
BASTARD:
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
BASTARD:
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
BASTARD:
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
BASTARD:
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
BASTARD:
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king
BASTARD:
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
BASTARD:
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.
BASTARD:
Exeunt
BASTARD:
ACT V
BASTARD:
SCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.
BASTARD:
Enter KING JOHN, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants
KING JOHN:
Thus have I yielded up into your hand
KING JOHN:
The circle of my glory.
KING JOHN:
Giving the crown
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Take again
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
From this my hand, as holding of the pope
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Your sovereign greatness and authority.
KING JOHN:
Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
KING JOHN:
And from his holiness use all your power
KING JOHN:
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.
KING JOHN:
Our discontented counties do revolt,
KING JOHN:
Our people quarrel with obedience,
KING JOHN:
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
KING JOHN:
To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
KING JOHN:
This inundation of mistemper'd humour
KING JOHN:
Rests by you only to be qualified
KING JOHN:
Then pause not, for the present time's so sick,
KING JOHN:
That present medicine must be minister'd,
KING JOHN:
Or overthrow incurable ensues.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
But since you are a gentle convertite,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And make fair weather in your blustering land.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
On this Ascension-day, remember well,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Upon your oath of service to the pope,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Exit
KING JOHN:
Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
KING JOHN:
Say that before Ascension-day at noon
KING JOHN:
My crown I should give off? Even so I have
KING JOHN:
I did suppose it should be on constraint
KING JOHN:
But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.
KING JOHN:
Enter the BASTARD
BASTARD:
All Kent hath yielded, nothing there holds out
BASTARD:
But Dover castle: London hath received,
BASTARD:
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers
BASTARD:
Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
BASTARD:
To offer service to your enemy,
BASTARD:
And wild amazement hurries up and down
BASTARD:
The little number of your doubtful friends.
KING JOHN:
Would not my lords return to me again,
KING JOHN:
After they heard young Arthur was alive?
BASTARD:
They found him dead and cast into the streets,
BASTARD:
An empty casket, where the jewel of life
BASTARD:
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.
KING JOHN:
That villain Hubert told me he did live.
BASTARD:
So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
BASTARD:
But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
BASTARD:
Be great in act, as you have been in thought,
BASTARD:
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
BASTARD:
Govern the motion of a kingly eye
BASTARD:
Be stirring as the time, be fire with fire,
BASTARD:
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
BASTARD:
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,
BASTARD:
That borrow their behaviors from the great,
BASTARD:
Grow great by your example and put on
BASTARD:
The dauntless spirit of resolution.
BASTARD:
Away, and glister like the god of war,
BASTARD:
When he intendeth to become the field
BASTARD:
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
BASTARD:
What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
BASTARD:
And fright him there? and make him tremble there?
BASTARD:
O, let it not be said: forage, and run
BASTARD:
To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
BASTARD:
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.
KING JOHN:
The legate of the pope hath been with me,
KING JOHN:
And I have made a happy peace with him,
KING JOHN:
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
KING JOHN:
Led by the Dauphin.
BASTARD:
O inglorious league!
BASTARD:
Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
BASTARD:
Send fair-play orders and make compromise,
BASTARD:
Insinuation, parley and base truce
BASTARD:
To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
BASTARD:
A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,
BASTARD:
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
BASTARD:
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
BASTARD:
And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms
BASTARD:
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace,
BASTARD:
Or if he do, let it at least be said
BASTARD:
They saw we had a purpose of defence.
KING JOHN:
Have thou the ordering of this present time.
BASTARD:
Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,
BASTARD:
Our party may well meet a prouder foe.
BASTARD:
Exeunt
BASTARD:
SCENE II. LEWIS's camp at St. Edmundsbury.
BASTARD:
Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE, BIGOT, and Soldiers
LEWIS:
My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,
LEWIS:
And keep it safe for our remembrance
LEWIS:
Return the precedent to these lords again,
LEWIS:
That, having our fair order written down,
LEWIS:
Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,
LEWIS:
May know wherefore we took the sacrament
LEWIS:
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
SALISBURY:
Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
SALISBURY:
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
SALISBURY:
A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
SALISBURY:
To your proceedings, yet believe me, prince,
SALISBURY:
I am not glad that such a sore of time
SALISBURY:
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
SALISBURY:
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
SALISBURY:
By making many. O, it grieves my soul,
SALISBURY:
That I must draw this metal from my side
SALISBURY:
To be a widow-maker! O, and there
SALISBURY:
Where honourable rescue and defence
SALISBURY:
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
SALISBURY:
But such is the infection of the time,
SALISBURY:
That, for the health and physic of our right,
SALISBURY:
We cannot deal but with the very hand
SALISBURY:
Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
SALISBURY:
And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,
SALISBURY:
That we, the sons and children of this isle,
SALISBURY:
Were born to see so sad an hour as this,
SALISBURY:
Wherein we step after a stranger march
SALISBURY:
Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
SALISBURY:
Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep
SALISBURY:
Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--
SALISBURY:
To grace the gentry of a land remote,
SALISBURY:
And follow unacquainted colours here?
SALISBURY:
What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
SALISBURY:
That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
SALISBURY:
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
SALISBURY:
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,
SALISBURY:
Where these two Christian armies might combine
SALISBURY:
The blood of malice in a vein of league,
SALISBURY:
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
LEWIS:
A noble temper dost thou show in this,
LEWIS:
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
LEWIS:
Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
LEWIS:
O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
LEWIS:
Between compulsion and a brave respect!
LEWIS:
Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
LEWIS:
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
LEWIS:
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
LEWIS:
Being an ordinary inundation,
LEWIS:
But this effusion of such manly drops,
LEWIS:
This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
LEWIS:
Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed
LEWIS:
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
LEWIS:
Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.
LEWIS:
Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
LEWIS:
And with a great heart heave away the storm
LEWIS:
Commend these waters to those baby eyes
LEWIS:
That never saw the giant world enraged,
LEWIS:
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
LEWIS:
Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
LEWIS:
Come, come, for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
LEWIS:
Into the purse of rich prosperity
LEWIS:
As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,
LEWIS:
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
LEWIS:
And even there, methinks, an angel spake
LEWIS:
Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH
LEWIS:
Look, where the holy legate comes apace,
LEWIS:
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
LEWIS:
And on our actions set the name of right
LEWIS:
With holy breath.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Hail, noble prince of France!
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
The next is this, King John hath reconciled
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Himself to Rome, his spirit is come in,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
That so stood out against the holy church,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
The great metropolis and see of Rome
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
That like a lion foster'd up at hand,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And be no further harmful than in show.
LEWIS:
Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back
LEWIS:
I am too high-born to be propertied,
LEWIS:
To be a secondary at control,
LEWIS:
Or useful serving-man and instrument,
LEWIS:
To any sovereign state throughout the world.
LEWIS:
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
LEWIS:
Between this chastised kingdom and myself,
LEWIS:
And brought in matter that should feed this fire,
LEWIS:
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
LEWIS:
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
LEWIS:
You taught me how to know the face of right,
LEWIS:
Acquainted me with interest to this land,
LEWIS:
Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart,
LEWIS:
And come ye now to tell me John hath made
LEWIS:
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
LEWIS:
I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,
LEWIS:
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine,
LEWIS:
And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back
LEWIS:
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
LEWIS:
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
LEWIS:
What men provided, what munition sent,
LEWIS:
To underprop this action? Is't not I
LEWIS:
That undergo this charge? who else but I,
LEWIS:
And such as to my claim are liable,
LEWIS:
Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
LEWIS:
Have I not heard these islanders shout out
LEWIS:
'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?
LEWIS:
Have I not here the best cards for the game,
LEWIS:
To win this easy match play'd for a crown?
LEWIS:
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
LEWIS:
No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
You look but on the outside of this work.
LEWIS:
Outside or inside, I will not return
LEWIS:
Till my attempt so much be glorified
LEWIS:
As to my ample hope was promised
LEWIS:
Before I drew this gallant head of war,
LEWIS:
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,
LEWIS:
To outlook conquest and to win renown
LEWIS:
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
LEWIS:
Trumpet sounds
LEWIS:
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
LEWIS:
Enter the BASTARD, attended
BASTARD:
According to the fair play of the world,
BASTARD:
Let me have audience, I am sent to speak
BASTARD:
My holy lord of Milan, from the king
BASTARD:
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him,
BASTARD:
And, as you answer, I do know the scope
BASTARD:
And warrant limited unto my tongue.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
And will not temporize with my entreaties,
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
BASTARD:
By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
BASTARD:
The youth says well. Now hear our English king,
BASTARD:
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
BASTARD:
He is prepared, and reason too he should
BASTARD:
This apish and unmannerly approach,
BASTARD:
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
BASTARD:
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
BASTARD:
The king doth smile at, and is well prepared
BASTARD:
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
BASTARD:
From out the circle of his territories.
BASTARD:
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
BASTARD:
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
BASTARD:
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
BASTARD:
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
BASTARD:
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,
BASTARD:
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
BASTARD:
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
BASTARD:
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
BASTARD:
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman,
BASTARD:
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
BASTARD:
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
BASTARD:
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
BASTARD:
And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,
BASTARD:
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
BASTARD:
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
BASTARD:
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
BASTARD:
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame,
BASTARD:
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
BASTARD:
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
BASTARD:
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
BASTARD:
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
BASTARD:
To fierce and bloody inclination.
LEWIS:
There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace,
LEWIS:
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well,
LEWIS:
We hold our time too precious to be spent
LEWIS:
With such a brabbler.
CARDINAL PANDULPH:
Give me leave to speak.
BASTARD:
No, I will speak.
LEWIS:
We will attend to neither.
LEWIS:
Strike up the drums, and let the tongue of war
LEWIS:
Plead for our interest and our being here.
BASTARD:
Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out,
BASTARD:
And so shall you, being beaten: do but start
BASTARD:
An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
BASTARD:
And even at hand a drum is ready braced
BASTARD:
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine,
BASTARD:
Sound but another, and another shall
BASTARD:
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
BASTARD:
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,
BASTARD:
Not trusting to this halting legate here,
BASTARD:
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
BASTARD:
Is warlike John, and in his forehead sits
BASTARD:
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
BASTARD:
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
LEWIS:
Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.
BASTARD:
And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
BASTARD:
Exeunt
BASTARD:
SCENE III. The field of battle.
BASTARD:
Alarums. Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT
KING JOHN:
How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
HUBERT:
Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?
KING JOHN:
This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
KING JOHN:
Lies heavy on me, O, my heart is sick!
KING JOHN:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
Messenger:
Desires your majesty to leave the field
Messenger:
And send him word by me which way you go.
KING JOHN:
Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
Messenger:
Be of good comfort, for the great supply
Messenger:
That was expected by the Dauphin here,
Messenger:
Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.
Messenger:
This news was brought to Richard but even now
Messenger:
The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.
KING JOHN:
Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,
KING JOHN:
And will not let me welcome this good news.
KING JOHN:
Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight,
KING JOHN:
Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
KING JOHN:
Exeunt
KING JOHN:
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
KING JOHN:
Enter SALISBURY, PEMBROKE, and BIGOT
SALISBURY:
I did not think the king so stored with friends.
PEMBROKE:
Up once again, put spirit in the French
PEMBROKE:
If they miscarry, we miscarry too.
SALISBURY:
That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
SALISBURY:
In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
PEMBROKE:
They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
PEMBROKE:
Enter MELUN, wounded
MELUN:
Lead me to the revolts of England here.
SALISBURY:
When we were happy we had other names.
PEMBROKE:
It is the Count Melun.
SALISBURY:
Wounded to death.
MELUN:
Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold,
MELUN:
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
MELUN:
And welcome home again discarded faith.
MELUN:
Seek out King John and fall before his feet,
MELUN:
For if the French be lords of this loud day,
MELUN:
He means to recompense the pains you take
MELUN:
By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn
MELUN:
And I with him, and many moe with me,
MELUN:
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury,
MELUN:
Even on that altar where we swore to you
MELUN:
Dear amity and everlasting love.
SALISBURY:
May this be possible? may this be true?
MELUN:
Have I not hideous death within my view,
MELUN:
Retaining but a quantity of life,
MELUN:
Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
MELUN:
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
MELUN:
What in the world should make me now deceive,
MELUN:
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
MELUN:
Why should I then be false, since it is true
MELUN:
That I must die here and live hence by truth?
MELUN:
I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
MELUN:
He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours
MELUN:
Behold another day break in the east
MELUN:
But even this night, whose black contagious breath
MELUN:
Already smokes about the burning crest
MELUN:
Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,
MELUN:
Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
MELUN:
Paying the fine of rated treachery
MELUN:
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
MELUN:
If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
MELUN:
Commend me to one Hubert with your king
MELUN:
The love of him, and this respect besides,
MELUN:
For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
MELUN:
Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
MELUN:
In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
MELUN:
From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
MELUN:
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
MELUN:
In peace, and part this body and my soul
MELUN:
With contemplation and devout desires.
SALISBURY:
We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
SALISBURY:
But I do love the favour and the form
SALISBURY:
Of this most fair occasion, by the which
SALISBURY:
We will untread the steps of damned flight,
SALISBURY:
And like a bated and retired flood,
SALISBURY:
Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
SALISBURY:
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
SALISBURY:
And cabby run on in obedience
SALISBURY:
Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
SALISBURY:
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,
SALISBURY:
For I do see the cruel pangs of death
SALISBURY:
Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight,
SALISBURY:
And happy newness, that intends old right.
SALISBURY:
Exeunt, leading off MELUN
SALISBURY:
SCENE V. The French camp.
SALISBURY:
Enter LEWIS and his train
LEWIS:
The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,
LEWIS:
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
LEWIS:
When English measure backward their own ground
LEWIS:
In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
LEWIS:
When with a volley of our needless shot,
LEWIS:
After such bloody toil, we bid good night,
LEWIS:
And wound our tattering colours clearly up,
LEWIS:
Last in the field, and almost lords of it!
LEWIS:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
LEWIS:
Here: what news?
Messenger:
The Count Melun is slain, the English lords
Messenger:
By his persuasion are again fall'n off,
Messenger:
And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
Messenger:
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.
LEWIS:
Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
LEWIS:
I did not think to be so sad to-night
LEWIS:
As this hath made me. Who was he that said
LEWIS:
King John did fly an hour or two before
LEWIS:
The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
Messenger:
Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
LEWIS:
Well, keep good quarter and good care to-night
LEWIS:
The day shall not be up so soon as I,
LEWIS:
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.
LEWIS:
Exeunt
LEWIS:
SCENE VI. An open place in the neighbourhood of Swinstead Abbey.
LEWIS:
Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT, severally
HUBERT:
Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
BASTARD:
A friend. What art thou?
HUBERT:
Of the part of England.
BASTARD:
Whither dost thou go?
HUBERT:
What's that to thee? why may not I demand
HUBERT:
Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
BASTARD:
Hubert, I think?
HUBERT:
Thou hast a perfect thought
HUBERT:
I will upon all hazards well believe
HUBERT:
Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.
HUBERT:
Who art thou?
BASTARD:
Who thou wilt: and if thou please,
BASTARD:
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
BASTARD:
I come one way of the Plantagenets.
HUBERT:
Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
HUBERT:
Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,
HUBERT:
That any accent breaking from thy tongue
HUBERT:
Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
BASTARD:
Come, come, sans compliment, what news abroad?
HUBERT:
Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
HUBERT:
To find you out.
BASTARD:
Brief, then, and what's the news?
HUBERT:
O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
HUBERT:
Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.
BASTARD:
Show me the very wound of this ill news
BASTARD:
I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.
HUBERT:
The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk
HUBERT:
I left him almost speechless, and broke out
HUBERT:
To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
HUBERT:
The better arm you to the sudden time,
HUBERT:
Than if you had at leisure known of this.
BASTARD:
How did he take it? who did taste to him?
HUBERT:
A monk, I tell you, a resolved villain,
HUBERT:
Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king
HUBERT:
Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.
BASTARD:
Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
HUBERT:
Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
HUBERT:
And brought Prince Henry in their company,
HUBERT:
At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
HUBERT:
And they are all about his majesty.
BASTARD:
Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
BASTARD:
And tempt us not to bear above our power!
BASTARD:
I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,
BASTARD:
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide,
BASTARD:
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them,
BASTARD:
Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.
BASTARD:
Away before: conduct me to the king,
BASTARD:
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
BASTARD:
Exeunt
BASTARD:
SCENE VII. The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.
BASTARD:
Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT
PRINCE HENRY:
It is too late: the life of all his blood
PRINCE HENRY:
Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,
PRINCE HENRY:
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
PRINCE HENRY:
Doth by the idle comments that it makes
PRINCE HENRY:
Foretell the ending of mortality.
PRINCE HENRY:
Enter PEMBROKE
PEMBROKE:
His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
PEMBROKE:
That, being brought into the open air,
PEMBROKE:
It would allay the burning quality
PEMBROKE:
Of that fell poison which assaileth him.
PRINCE HENRY:
Let him be brought into the orchard here.
PRINCE HENRY:
Doth he still rage?
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit BIGOT
PEMBROKE:
He is more patient
PEMBROKE:
Than when you left him, even now he sung.
PRINCE HENRY:
O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
PRINCE HENRY:
In their continuance will not feel themselves.
PRINCE HENRY:
Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
PRINCE HENRY:
Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
PRINCE HENRY:
Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
PRINCE HENRY:
With many legions of strange fantasies,
PRINCE HENRY:
Whi ch, in their throng and press to that last hold,
PRINCE HENRY:
Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death
PRINCE HENRY:
should sing.
PRINCE HENRY:
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
PRINCE HENRY:
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
PRINCE HENRY:
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
PRINCE HENRY:
His soul and body to their lasting rest.
SALISBURY:
Be of good comfort, prince, for you are born
SALISBURY:
To set a form upon that indigest
SALISBURY:
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
SALISBURY:
Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair
KING JOHN:
Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room,
KING JOHN:
It would not out at windows nor at doors.
KING JOHN:
There is so hot a summer in my bosom,
KING JOHN:
That all my bowels crumble up to dust
KING JOHN:
I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
KING JOHN:
Upon a parchment, and against this fire
KING JOHN:
Do I shrink up.
PRINCE HENRY:
How fares your majesty?
KING JOHN:
Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off
KING JOHN:
And none of you will bid the winter come
KING JOHN:
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
KING JOHN:
Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
KING JOHN:
Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
KING JOHN:
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
KING JOHN:
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,
KING JOHN:
I beg cold comfort, and you are so strait
KING JOHN:
And so ingrateful, you deny me that.
PRINCE HENRY:
O that there were some virtue in my tears,
PRINCE HENRY:
That might relieve you!
KING JOHN:
The salt in them is hot.
KING JOHN:
Within me is a hell, and there the poison
KING JOHN:
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
KING JOHN:
On unreprievable condemned blood.
KING JOHN:
Enter the BASTARD
BASTARD:
O, I am scalded with my violent motion,
BASTARD:
And spleen of speed to see your majesty!
KING JOHN:
O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye
KING JOHN:
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,
KING JOHN:
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
KING JOHN:
Are turned to one thread, one little hair
KING JOHN:
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
KING JOHN:
Which holds but till thy news be uttered,
KING JOHN:
And then all this thou seest is but a clod
KING JOHN:
And module of confounded royalty.
BASTARD:
The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
BASTARD:
Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him,
BASTARD:
For in a night the best part of my power,
BASTARD:
As I upon advantage did remove,
BASTARD:
Were in the Washes all unwarily
BASTARD:
Devoured by the unexpected flood.
BASTARD:
KING JOHN dies
SALISBURY:
You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
SALISBURY:
My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.
PRINCE HENRY:
Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
PRINCE HENRY:
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
PRINCE HENRY:
When this was now a king, and now is clay?
BASTARD:
Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
BASTARD:
To do the office for thee of revenge,
BASTARD:
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
BASTARD:
As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
BASTARD:
Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
BASTARD:
Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,
BASTARD:
And instantly return with me again,
BASTARD:
To push destruction and perpetual shame
BASTARD:
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
BASTARD:
Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought,
BASTARD:
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
SALISBURY:
It seems you know not, then, so much as we
SALISBURY:
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
SALISBURY:
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
SALISBURY:
And brings from him such offers of our peace
SALISBURY:
As we with honour and respect may take,
SALISBURY:
With purpose presently to leave this war.
BASTARD:
He will the rather do it when he sees
BASTARD:
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
SALISBURY:
Nay, it is in a manner done already,
SALISBURY:
For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
SALISBURY:
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
SALISBURY:
To the disposing of the cardinal
SALISBURY:
With whom yourself, myself and other lords,
SALISBURY:
If you think meet, this afternoon will post
SALISBURY:
To consummate this business happily.
BASTARD:
Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
BASTARD:
With other princes that may best be spared,
BASTARD:
Shall wait upon your father's funeral.
PRINCE HENRY:
At Worcester must his body be interr'd,
PRINCE HENRY:
For so he will'd it.
BASTARD:
Thither shall it then
BASTARD:
And happily may your sweet self put on
BASTARD:
The lineal state and glory of the land!
BASTARD:
To whom with all submission, on my knee
BASTARD:
I do bequeath my faithful services
BASTARD:
And true subjection everlastingly.
SALISBURY:
And the like tender of our love we make,
SALISBURY:
To rest without a spot for evermore.
PRINCE HENRY:
I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
PRINCE HENRY:
And knows not how to do it but with tears.
BASTARD:
O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
BASTARD:
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
BASTARD:
This England never did, nor never shall,
BASTARD:
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
BASTARD:
But when it first did help to wound itself.
BASTARD:
Now these her princes are come home again,
BASTARD:
Come the three corners of the world in arms,
BASTARD:
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
BASTARD:
If England to itself do rest but true.
BASTARD:
Exeunt
