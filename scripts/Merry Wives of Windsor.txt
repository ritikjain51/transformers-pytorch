SLENDER:
'Coram.'

SLENDER:
Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too, and a gentleman born,
SLENDER:
master parson, who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any
SLENDER:
bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'
SHALLOW:
Ay, that I do, and have done any time these three
SHALLOW:
hundred years.
SLENDER:
All his successors gone before him hath done't, and
SLENDER:
all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
SLENDER:
give the dozen white luces in their coat.
SHALLOW:
It is an old coat.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
The dozen white louses do become an old coat well,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
it agrees well, passant, it is a familiar beast to
SIR HUGH EVANS:
man, and signifies love.
SHALLOW:
The luce is the fresh fish, the salt fish is an old coat.
SLENDER:
I may quarter, coz.
SHALLOW:
You may, by marrying.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.
SHALLOW:
Not a whit.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Yes, py'r lady, if he has a quarter of your coat,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
SIR HUGH EVANS:
simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
SIR HUGH EVANS:
John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
SIR HUGH EVANS:
you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
SIR HUGH EVANS:
benevolence to make atonements and compremises
SIR HUGH EVANS:
between you.
SHALLOW:
The council shall bear it, it is a riot.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is not meet the council hear a riot, there is no
SIR HUGH EVANS:
fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
SIR HUGH EVANS:
desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a
SIR HUGH EVANS:
riot, take your vizaments in that.
SHALLOW:
Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword
SHALLOW:
should end it.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it
SIR HUGH EVANS:
and there is also another device in my prain, which
SIR HUGH EVANS:
peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
SIR HUGH EVANS:
is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Page, which is pretty virginity.
SLENDER:
Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
SLENDER:
small like a woman.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as
SIR HUGH EVANS:

SIR HUGH EVANS:
and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
SIR HUGH EVANS:
death's-bed--Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
SIR HUGH EVANS:

SIR HUGH EVANS:
old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
SIR HUGH EVANS:

SIR HUGH EVANS:
Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.
SLENDER:
Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.
SLENDER:
I know the young gentlewoman, she has good gifts.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts.
SHALLOW:
Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
SIR HUGH EVANS:
despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
SIR HUGH EVANS:
is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there, and, I
SIR HUGH EVANS:

SIR HUGH EVANS:
peradventures shall tell you another tale, if

PAGE:
Sir, I thank you.
SHALLOW:
Sir, I thank you, by yea and no, I do.
PAGE:
I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.
SLENDER:
How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he
SLENDER:
was outrun on Cotsall.
PAGE:
It could not be judged, sir.
SLENDER:
You'll not confess, you'll not confess.
SHALLOW:
That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault,
SHALLOW:
'tis a good dog.
PAGE:
A cur, sir.
SHALLOW:
Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be
SHALLOW:
more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
SHALLOW:
Falstaff here?
PAGE:
Sir, he is within, and I would I could do a good
PAGE:
office between you.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.
SHALLOW:
He hath wronged me, Master Page.
PAGE:
Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.
SHALLOW:
If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that
SHALLOW:
so, Master Page? He hath wronged me, indeed he
SHALLOW:
hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
SHALLOW:
Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.
PAGE:
Here comes Sir John.
PAGE:
Enter FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL
FALSTAFF:
Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?
SHALLOW:
Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and
SHALLOW:
broke open my lodge.
FALSTAFF:
But not kissed your keeper's daughter?
SHALLOW:
Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.
FALSTAFF:
I will answer it straight, I have done all this.
FALSTAFF:
That is now answered.
SHALLOW:
The council shall know this.
FALSTAFF:
'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel
FALSTAFF:
you'll be laughed at.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Pauca verba, Sir John, goot worts.
FALSTAFF:
Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
FALSTAFF:
head: what matter have you against me?
SLENDER:
Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you,
SLENDER:
and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
SLENDER:
Nym, and Pistol.
BARDOLPH:
You Banbury cheese!
SLENDER:
Ay, it is no matter.
PISTOL:
How now, Mephostophilus!
SLENDER:
Ay, it is no matter.
NYM:
Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.
SLENDER:
Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
SIR HUGH EVANS:
three umpires in this matter, as I understand, that
SIR HUGH EVANS:
is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page, and there is
SIR HUGH EVANS:
myself, fidelicet myself, and the three party is,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.
PAGE:
We three, to hear it and end it between them.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-
SIR HUGH EVANS:
book, and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
SIR HUGH EVANS:
as great discreetly as we can.
FALSTAFF:
Pistol!
PISTOL:
He hears with ears.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He
SIR HUGH EVANS:
hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.
FALSTAFF:
Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?
SLENDER:
Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might
SLENDER:
never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
SLENDER:
seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
SLENDER:
shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
SLENDER:
pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
FALSTAFF:
Is this true, Pistol?
SIR HUGH EVANS:
No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.
PISTOL:
Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,
PISTOL:
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
PISTOL:
Word of denial in thy labras here!
PISTOL:
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!
SLENDER:
By these gloves, then, 'twas he.
NYM:
Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say
NYM:
'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
NYM:
humour on me, that is the very note of it.
SLENDER:
By this hat, then, he in the red face had it, for
SLENDER:
though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
SLENDER:
drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.
FALSTAFF:
What say you, Scarlet and John?
BARDOLPH:
Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
BARDOLPH:
himself out of his five sentences.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!
BARDOLPH:
And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered, and
BARDOLPH:
so conclusions passed the careires.
SLENDER:
Ay, you spake in Latin then too, but 'tis no
SLENDER:
matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,
SLENDER:
but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick
SLENDER:
if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have
SLENDER:
the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.
FALSTAFF:
You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen, you hear it.
FALSTAFF:
Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine, MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE, following
PAGE:
Nay, daughter, carry the wine in, we'll drink within.
PAGE:
Exit ANNE PAGE
SLENDER:
O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.
PAGE:
How now, Mistress Ford!
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met
FALSTAFF:
by your leave, good mistress.
FALSTAFF:
Kisses her
PAGE:
Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
PAGE:
hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
PAGE:
we shall drink down all unkindness.
PAGE:
Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS
SLENDER:
I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
SLENDER:
Songs and Sonnets here.
SLENDER:
Enter SIMPLE
SLENDER:
How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait
SLENDER:
on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
SLENDER:
about you, have you?
SIMPLE:
Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
SIMPLE:
Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
SIMPLE:
afore Michaelmas?
SHALLOW:
Come, coz, come, coz, we stay for you. A word with
SHALLOW:
you, coz, marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
SHALLOW:
tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
SHALLOW:
here. Do you understand me?
SLENDER:
Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable, if it be so,
SLENDER:
I shall do that that is reason.
SHALLOW:
Nay, but understand me.
SLENDER:
So I do, sir.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will
SIR HUGH EVANS:
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
SLENDER:
Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray
SLENDER:
you, pardon me, he's a justice of peace in his
SLENDER:
country, simple though I stand here.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
But that is not the question: the question is
SIR HUGH EVANS:
concerning your marriage.
SHALLOW:
Ay, there's the point, sir.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Marry, is it, the very point of it, to Mistress Anne Page.
SLENDER:
Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
SLENDER:
reasonable demands.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to
SIR HUGH EVANS:
know that of your mouth or of your lips, for divers
SIR HUGH EVANS:
philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
SIR HUGH EVANS:
mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
SIR HUGH EVANS:
good will to the maid?
SHALLOW:
Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
SLENDER:
I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
SLENDER:
would do reason.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak
SIR HUGH EVANS:
possitable, if you can carry her your desires
SIR HUGH EVANS:
towards her.
SHALLOW:
That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?
SLENDER:
I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
SLENDER:
request, cousin, in any reason.
SHALLOW:
Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do
SHALLOW:
is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?
SLENDER:
I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
SLENDER:
be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
SLENDER:
decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
SLENDER:
married and have more occasion to know one another,
SLENDER:
I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt
SLENDER:
but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her, that
SLENDER:
I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in
SIR HUGH EVANS:
the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our
SIR HUGH EVANS:
meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.
SHALLOW:
Ay, I think my cousin meant well.
SLENDER:
Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!
SHALLOW:
Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
SHALLOW:
Re-enter ANNE PAGE
SHALLOW:
Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!
ANNE PAGE:
The dinner is on the table, my father desires your
ANNE PAGE:
worships' company.
SHALLOW:
I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Exeunt SHALLOW and SIR HUGH EVANS
ANNE PAGE:
Will't please your worship to come in, sir?
SLENDER:
No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily, I am very well.
ANNE PAGE:
The dinner attends you, sir.
SLENDER:
I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
SLENDER:
sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my
SLENDER:
cousin Shallow.
SLENDER:
Exit SIMPLE
SLENDER:
A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his
SLENDER:
friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
SLENDER:
yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I
SLENDER:
live like a poor gentleman born.
ANNE PAGE:
I may not go in without your worship: they will not
ANNE PAGE:
sit till you come.
SLENDER:
I' faith, I'll eat nothing, I thank you as much as
SLENDER:
though I did.
ANNE PAGE:
I pray you, sir, walk in.
SLENDER:
I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
SLENDER:
my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
SLENDER:
dagger with a master of fence, three veneys for a
SLENDER:
dish of stewed prunes, and, by my troth, I cannot
SLENDER:
abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
SLENDER:
dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?
ANNE PAGE:
I think there are, sir, I heard them talked of.
SLENDER:
I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at
SLENDER:
it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
SLENDER:
the bear loose, are you not?
ANNE PAGE:
Ay, indeed, sir.
SLENDER:
That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen
SLENDER:
Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
SLENDER:
the chain, but, I warrant you, the women have so
SLENDER:
cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
SLENDER:
indeed, cannot abide 'em, they are very ill-favored
SLENDER:
rough things.
SLENDER:
Re-enter PAGE
PAGE:
Come, gentle Master Slender, come, we stay for you.
SLENDER:
I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.
PAGE:
By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.
SLENDER:
Nay, pray you, lead the way.
PAGE:
Come on, sir.
SLENDER:
Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
ANNE PAGE:
Not I, sir, pray you, keep on.
SLENDER:
I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
SLENDER:
You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!
SLENDER:
Exeunt
SLENDER:
SCENE II. The same.
SLENDER:
Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which
SIR HUGH EVANS:
is the way: and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry
SIR HUGH EVANS:
nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and
SIR HUGH EVANS:
his wringer.
SIMPLE:
Well, sir.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter, for it
SIR HUGH EVANS:
is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire
SIR HUGH EVANS:
and require her to solicit your master's desires to
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
SIR HUGH EVANS:
make an end of my dinner, there's pippins and cheese to come.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Exeunt
SIR HUGH EVANS:
SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Enter FALSTAFF, Host, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL, and ROBIN
FALSTAFF:
Mine host of the Garter!
Host:
What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.
FALSTAFF:
Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
FALSTAFF:
followers.
Host:
Discard, bully Hercules, cashier: let them wag, trot, trot.
FALSTAFF:
I sit at ten pounds a week.
Host:
Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I
Host:
will entertain Bardolph, he shall draw, he shall
Host:
tap: said I well, bully Hector?
FALSTAFF:
Do so, good mine host.
Host:
I have spoke, let him follow.
Host:
To BARDOLPH
Host:
Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word, follow.
Host:
Exit
FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade
FALSTAFF:
an old cloak makes a new jerkin, a withered
FALSTAFF:
serving-man a fresh tapster. Go, adieu.
BARDOLPH:
It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.
PISTOL:
O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?
PISTOL:
Exit BARDOLPH
NYM:
He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?
FALSTAFF:
I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his
FALSTAFF:
thefts were too open, his filching was like an
FALSTAFF:
unskilful singer, he kept not time.
NYM:
The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.
PISTOL:
'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico
PISTOL:
for the phrase!
FALSTAFF:
Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.
PISTOL:
Why, then, let kibes ensue.
FALSTAFF:
There is no remedy, I must cony-catch, I must shift.
PISTOL:
Young ravens must have food.
FALSTAFF:
Which of you know Ford of this town?
PISTOL:
I ken the wight: he is of substance good.
FALSTAFF:
My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.
PISTOL:
Two yards, and more.
FALSTAFF:
No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
FALSTAFF:
yards about, but I am now about no waste, I am about
FALSTAFF:
thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
FALSTAFF:
wife: I spy entertainment in her, she discourses,
FALSTAFF:
she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
FALSTAFF:
can construe the action of her familiar style, and
FALSTAFF:
the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
FALSTAFF:
rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'
PISTOL:
He hath studied her will, and translated her will,
PISTOL:
out of honesty into English.
NYM:
The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?
FALSTAFF:
Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
FALSTAFF:
husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.
PISTOL:
As many devils entertain, and 'To her, boy,' say I.
NYM:
The humour rises, it is good: humour me the angels.
FALSTAFF:
I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
FALSTAFF:
another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
FALSTAFF:
eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
FALSTAFF:
oeillades, sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
FALSTAFF:
foot, sometimes my portly belly.
PISTOL:
Then did the sun on dunghill shine.
NYM:
I thank thee for that humour.
FALSTAFF:
O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
FALSTAFF:
greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
FALSTAFF:
seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's
FALSTAFF:
another letter to her: she bears the purse too, she
FALSTAFF:
is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
FALSTAFF:
be cheater to them both, and they shall be
FALSTAFF:
exchequers to me, they shall be my East and West
FALSTAFF:
Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
FALSTAFF:
this letter to Mistress Page, and thou this to
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.
PISTOL:
Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
PISTOL:
And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!
NYM:
I will run no base humour: here, take the
NYM:
humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.
FALSTAFF:
[To ROBIN]  Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly,
FALSTAFF:
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
FALSTAFF:
Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go,
FALSTAFF:
Trudge, plod away o' the hoof, seek shelter, pack!
FALSTAFF:
Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,
FALSTAFF:
French thrift, you rogues, myself and skirted page.
FALSTAFF:
Exeunt FALSTAFF and ROBIN
PISTOL:
Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
PISTOL:
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor
PISTOL:
Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
PISTOL:
Base Phrygian Turk!
NYM:
I have operations which be humours of revenge.
PISTOL:
Wilt thou revenge?
NYM:
By welkin and her star!
PISTOL:
With wit or steel?
NYM:
With both the humours, I
NYM:
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.
PISTOL:
And I to Ford shall eke unfold
PISTOL:
How Falstaff, varlet vile,
PISTOL:
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
PISTOL:
And his soft couch defile.
NYM:
My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to
NYM:
deal with poison, I will possess him with
NYM:
yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous
NYM:
that is my true humour.
PISTOL:
Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee, troop on.
PISTOL:
Exeunt
PISTOL:
SCENE IV. A room in DOCTOR CAIUS' house.
PISTOL:
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, SIMPLE, and RUGBY
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
body in the house, here will be an old abusing of
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
God's patience and the king's English.
RUGBY:
I'll go watch.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Go, and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Exit RUGBY
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
that he is given to prayer, he is something peevish
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
that way: but nobody but has his fault, but let
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?
SIMPLE:
Ay, for fault of a better.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And Master Slender's your master?
SIMPLE:
Ay, forsooth.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
glover's paring-knife?
SIMPLE:
No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a
SIMPLE:
little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
A softly-sprighted man, is he not?
SIMPLE:
Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands
SIMPLE:
as any is between this and his head, he hath fought
SIMPLE:
with a warrener.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?
SIMPLE:
Yes, indeed, does he.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--
MISTRESS QUICKLY:

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Shuts SIMPLE in the closet
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Go, John, go inquire for my master, I doubt
MISTRESS QUICKLY:

MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I am glad he went not in himself: if he had found
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
the young man, he would have been horn-mad.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je
DOCTOR CAIUS:
m'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Is it this, sir?
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Oui, mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere
DOCTOR CAIUS:
is dat knave Rugby?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
What, John Rugby! John!
RUGBY:
Here, sir!
DOCTOR CAIUS:
You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come,
DOCTOR CAIUS:
take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.
RUGBY:
'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me!
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Qu'ai-j'oublie! dere is some simples in my closet,
DOCTOR CAIUS:
dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Ay me, he'll find the young man here, and be mad!
DOCTOR CAIUS:
O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villain! larron!
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Pulling SIMPLE out
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Rugby, my rapier!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Good master, be content.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Wherefore shall I be content-a?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
The young man is an honest man.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is
DOCTOR CAIUS:
no honest man dat shall come in my closet.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
of it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vell.
SIMPLE:
Ay, forsooth, to desire her to--
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Peace, I pray you.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.
SIMPLE:
To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
SIMPLE:
speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my
SIMPLE:
master in the way of marriage.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
finger in the fire, and need not.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Tarry you a little-a while.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Writes
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
[Aside to SIMPLE]  I am glad he is so quiet: if he
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
had been thoroughly moved, you should have heard him
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
man, I'll do you your master what good I can: and
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
master,--I may call him my master, look you, for I
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
keep his house, and I wash, wring, brew, bake,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds and do
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
all myself,--
SIMPLE:
[Aside to MISTRESS QUICKLY]  'Tis a great charge to
SIMPLE:
come under one body's hand.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
[Aside to SIMPLE]  Are you avised o' that? you
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
shall find it a great charge: and to be up early
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
and down late, but notwithstanding,--to tell you in
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
your ear, I would have no words of it,--my master
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,--that's
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
neither here nor there.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh, by
DOCTOR CAIUS:
gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in dee
DOCTOR CAIUS:
park, and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest
DOCTOR CAIUS:
to meddle or make. You may be gone, it is not good
DOCTOR CAIUS:
you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two
DOCTOR CAIUS:
stones, by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw
DOCTOR CAIUS:
at his dog
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Exit SIMPLE
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Alas, he speaks but for his friend.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
It is no matter-a ver dat: do not you tell-a me
DOCTOR CAIUS:
dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I
DOCTOR CAIUS:
vill kill de Jack priest, and I have appointed mine
DOCTOR CAIUS:
host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I
DOCTOR CAIUS:
will myself have Anne Page.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have
DOCTOR CAIUS:
not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my
DOCTOR CAIUS:
door. Follow my heels, Rugby.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Exeunt DOCTOR CAIUS and RUGBY
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
knows more of Anne's mind than I do, nor can do more
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
than I do with her, I thank heaven.
FENTON:
[Within]  Who's within there? ho!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Enter FENTON
FENTON:
How now, good woman? how dost thou?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.
FENTON:
What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
gentle, and one that is your friend, I can tell you
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
that by the way, I praise heaven for it.
FENTON:
Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
book, she loves you. Have not your worship a wart
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
above your eye?
FENTON:
Yes, marry, have I, what of that?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
another Nan, but, I detest, an honest maid as ever
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
indeed she is given too much to allicholy and
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
musing: but for you--well, go to.
FENTON:
Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money
FENTON:
for thee, let me have thy voice in my behalf: if
FENTON:
thou seest her before me, commend me.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Will I? i'faith, that we will, and I will tell your
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
worship more of the wart the next time we have
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
confidence, and of other wooers.
FENTON:
Well, farewell, I am in great haste now.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Farewell to your worship.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Exit FENTON
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Truly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
for I know Anne's mind as well as another does. Out
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
upon't! what have I forgot?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Exit

ACT II
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
SCENE I. Before PAGE'S house.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter
MISTRESS PAGE:
What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-
MISTRESS PAGE:
time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Let me see.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Reads
MISTRESS PAGE:
'Ask me no reason why I love you, for though
MISTRESS PAGE:
Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
MISTRESS PAGE:
not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
MISTRESS PAGE:
am I, go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,
MISTRESS PAGE:
so am I, ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you
MISTRESS PAGE:
love sack, and so do I, would you desire better
MISTRESS PAGE:
sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at
MISTRESS PAGE:
the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--
MISTRESS PAGE:
that I love thee. I will not say, pity me, 'tis
MISTRESS PAGE:
not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Thine own true knight,
MISTRESS PAGE:
By day or night,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Or any kind of light,
MISTRESS PAGE:
With all his might
MISTRESS PAGE:
For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'
MISTRESS PAGE:
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
MISTRESS PAGE:
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
MISTRESS PAGE:
age to show himself a young gallant! What an
MISTRESS PAGE:
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
MISTRESS PAGE:
picked--with the devil's name!--out of my
MISTRESS PAGE:
conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
MISTRESS PAGE:
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
MISTRESS PAGE:
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill
MISTRESS PAGE:
in the parliament for the putting down of men. How
MISTRESS PAGE:
shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,
MISTRESS PAGE:
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Enter MISTRESS FORD
MISTRESS FORD:
Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.
MISTRESS PAGE:
And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very
MISTRESS PAGE:
ill.
MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, I'll ne'er believe that, I have to show to the contrary.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Faith, but you do, in my mind.
MISTRESS FORD:
Well, I do then, yet I say I could show you to the
MISTRESS FORD:
contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!
MISTRESS PAGE:
What's the matter, woman?
MISTRESS FORD:
O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I
MISTRESS FORD:
could come to such honour!
MISTRESS PAGE:
Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is
MISTRESS PAGE:
it? dispense with trifles, what is it?
MISTRESS FORD:
If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,
MISTRESS FORD:
I could be knighted.
MISTRESS PAGE:
What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights
MISTRESS PAGE:
will hack, and so thou shouldst not alter the
MISTRESS PAGE:
article of thy gentry.
MISTRESS FORD:
We burn daylight: here, read, read, perceive how I
MISTRESS FORD:
might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
MISTRESS FORD:
men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of
MISTRESS FORD:
men's liking: and yet he would not swear, praised
MISTRESS FORD:
women's modesty, and gave such orderly and
MISTRESS FORD:
well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I
MISTRESS FORD:
would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
MISTRESS FORD:
the truth of his words, but they do no more adhere
MISTRESS FORD:
and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to
MISTRESS FORD:
the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
MISTRESS FORD:
threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
MISTRESS FORD:
belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged
MISTRESS FORD:
on him? I think the best way were to entertain him
MISTRESS FORD:
with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted
MISTRESS FORD:
him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and
MISTRESS PAGE:
Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery
MISTRESS PAGE:
of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy
MISTRESS PAGE:
letter: but let thine inherit first, for, I
MISTRESS PAGE:
protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a
MISTRESS PAGE:
thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
MISTRESS PAGE:
different names--sure, more,--and these are of the
MISTRESS PAGE:
second edition: he will print them, out of doubt,
MISTRESS PAGE:
for he cares not what he puts into the press, when
MISTRESS PAGE:
he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,
MISTRESS PAGE:
and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you
MISTRESS PAGE:
twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.
MISTRESS FORD:
Why, this is the very same, the very hand, the very
MISTRESS FORD:
words. What doth he think of us?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to
MISTRESS PAGE:
wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain
MISTRESS PAGE:
myself like one that I am not acquainted withal,
MISTRESS PAGE:
for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I
MISTRESS PAGE:
know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.
MISTRESS FORD:
'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him
MISTRESS FORD:
above deck.
MISTRESS PAGE:
So will I	if he come under my hatches, I'll never
MISTRESS PAGE:
to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's
MISTRESS PAGE:
appoint him a meeting, give him a show of comfort in
MISTRESS PAGE:
his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,
MISTRESS PAGE:
till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.
MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,
MISTRESS FORD:
that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,
MISTRESS FORD:
that my husband saw this letter! it would give
MISTRESS FORD:
eternal food to his jealousy.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Why, look where he comes, and my good man too: he's
MISTRESS PAGE:
as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause,
MISTRESS PAGE:
and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.
MISTRESS FORD:
You are the happier woman.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Let's consult together against this greasy knight.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Come hither.
MISTRESS PAGE:
They retire
MISTRESS PAGE:
Enter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with NYM
FORD:
Well, I hope it be not so.
PISTOL:
Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs
PISTOL:
Sir John affects thy wife.
FORD:
Why, sir, my wife is not young.
PISTOL:
He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,
PISTOL:
Both young and old, one with another, Ford,
PISTOL:
He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.
FORD:
Love my wife!
PISTOL:
With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
PISTOL:
Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels
PISTOL:
O, odious is the name!
FORD:
What name, sir?
PISTOL:
The horn, I say. Farewell.
PISTOL:
Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night
PISTOL:
Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.
PISTOL:
Away, Sir Corporal Nym!
PISTOL:
Believe it, Page, he speaks sense.
PISTOL:
Exit
FORD:
[Aside]  I will be patient, I will find out this.
NYM:
[To PAGE]  And this is true, I like not the humour
NYM:
of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I
NYM:
should have borne the humoured letter to her, but I
NYM:
have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.
NYM:
He loves your wife, there's the short and the long.
NYM:
My name is Corporal Nym, I speak and I avouch, 'tis
NYM:
true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.
NYM:
Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,
NYM:
and there's the humour of it. Adieu.
NYM:
Exit
PAGE:
'The humour of it,' quoth a'! here's a fellow
PAGE:
frights English out of his wits.
FORD:
I will seek out Falstaff.
PAGE:
I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.
FORD:
If I do find it: well.
PAGE:
I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest
PAGE:
o' the town commended him for a true man.
FORD:
'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.
PAGE:
How now, Meg!
PAGE:
MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD come forward
MISTRESS PAGE:
Whither go you, George? Hark you.
MISTRESS FORD:
How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy?
FORD:
I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.
MISTRESS FORD:
Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,
MISTRESS FORD:
will you go, Mistress Page?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Aside to MISTRESS FORD
MISTRESS PAGE:
Look who comes yonder: she shall be our messenger
MISTRESS PAGE:
to this paltry knight.
MISTRESS FORD:
[Aside to MISTRESS PAGE]  Trust me, I thought on her
MISTRESS FORD:
she'll fit it.
MISTRESS FORD:
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
MISTRESS PAGE:
You are come to see my daughter Anne?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Ay, forsooth, and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with
MISTRESS PAGE:
you.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and MISTRESS QUICKLY
PAGE:
How now, Master Ford!
FORD:
You heard what this knave told me, did you not?
PAGE:
Yes: and you heard what the other told me?
FORD:
Do you think there is truth in them?
PAGE:
Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
PAGE:
offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent
PAGE:
towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men,
PAGE:
very rogues, now they be out of service.
FORD:
Were they his men?
PAGE:
Marry, were they.
FORD:
I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at
FORD:
the Garter?
PAGE:
Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage
PAGE:
towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him, and
PAGE:
what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it
PAGE:
lie on my head.
FORD:
I do not misdoubt my wife, but I would be loath to
FORD:
turn them together. A man may be too confident: I
FORD:
would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.
PAGE:
Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes
PAGE:
there is either liquor in his pate or money in his
PAGE:
purse when he looks so merrily.
PAGE:
Enter Host
PAGE:
How now, mine host!
Host:
How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.
Host:
Cavaleiro-justice, I say!
Host:
Enter SHALLOW
SHALLOW:
I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
SHALLOW:
twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go
SHALLOW:
with us? we have sport in hand.
Host:
Tell him, cavaleiro-justice, tell him, bully-rook.
SHALLOW:
Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
SHALLOW:
the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.
FORD:
Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.
FORD:
Drawing him aside
Host:
What sayest thou, my bully-rook?
SHALLOW:
[To PAGE]  Will you go with us to behold it? My
SHALLOW:
merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons,
SHALLOW:
and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places,
SHALLOW:
for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.
SHALLOW:
Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.
SHALLOW:
They converse apart
Host:
Hast thou no suit against my knight, my
Host:
guest-cavaleire?
FORD:
None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of
FORD:
burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him
FORD:
my name is Brook, only for a jest.
Host:
My hand, bully, thou shalt have egress and regress,
Host:
--said I well?--and thy name shall be Brook. It is
Host:
a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?
SHALLOW:
Have with you, mine host.
PAGE:
I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in
PAGE:
his rapier.
SHALLOW:
Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times
SHALLOW:
you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and
SHALLOW:
I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page, 'tis
SHALLOW:
here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long
SHALLOW:
sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.
Host:
Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?
PAGE:
Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.
PAGE:
Exeunt Host, SHALLOW, and PAGE
FORD:
Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly
FORD:
on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my
FORD:
opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's
FORD:
house, and what they made there, I know not. Well,
FORD:
I will look further into't: and I have a disguise
FORD:
to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not
FORD:
my labour, if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.
FORD:
Exit
FORD:
SCENE II. A room in the Garter Inn.
FORD:
Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL
FALSTAFF:
I will not lend thee a penny.
PISTOL:
Why, then the world's mine oyster.
PISTOL:
Which I with sword will open.
FALSTAFF:
Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should
FALSTAFF:
lay my countenance to pawn, I have grated upon my
FALSTAFF:
good friends for three reprieves for you and your
FALSTAFF:
coach-fellow Nym, or else you had looked through
FALSTAFF:
the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in
FALSTAFF:
hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were
FALSTAFF:
good soldiers and tall fellows, and when Mistress
FALSTAFF:
Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon
FALSTAFF:
mine honour thou hadst it not.
PISTOL:
Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?
FALSTAFF:
Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
FALSTAFF:
endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more
FALSTAFF:
about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife
FALSTAFF:
and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.
FALSTAFF:
You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you
FALSTAFF:
stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable
FALSTAFF:
baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the
FALSTAFF:
terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself
FALSTAFF:
sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand
FALSTAFF:
and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to
FALSTAFF:
shuffle, to hedge and to lurch, and yet you, rogue,
FALSTAFF:
will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain
FALSTAFF:
looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your
FALSTAFF:
bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your
FALSTAFF:
honour! You will not do it, you!
PISTOL:
I do relent: what would thou more of man?
PISTOL:
Enter ROBIN
ROBIN:
Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
FALSTAFF:
Let her approach.
FALSTAFF:
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Give your worship good morrow.
FALSTAFF:
Good morrow, good wife.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Not so, an't please your worship.
FALSTAFF:
Good maid, then.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I'll be sworn,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
As my mother was, the first hour I was born.
FALSTAFF:
I do believe the swearer. What with me?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
FALSTAFF:
Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee
FALSTAFF:
the hearing.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Doctor Caius,--
FALSTAFF:
Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
come a little nearer this ways.
FALSTAFF:
I warrant thee, nobody hears, mine own people, mine
FALSTAFF:
own people.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!
FALSTAFF:
Well, Mistress Ford, what of her?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
of us, I pray!
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, come, Mistress Ford,--
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Marry, this is the short and the long of it, you
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
after gift, smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
such alligant terms, and in such wine and sugar of
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
the best and the fairest, that would have won any
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
woman's heart, and, I warrant you, they could never
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
given me this morning, but I defy all angels, in
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
is more, pensioners, but, I warrant you, all is one with her.
FALSTAFF:
But what says she to me? be brief, my good
FALSTAFF:
she-Mercury.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
she thanks you a thousand times, and she gives you
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
to notify that her husband will be absence from his
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
house between ten and eleven.
FALSTAFF:
Ten and eleven?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Ay, forsooth, and then you may come and see the
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
him, good heart.
FALSTAFF:
Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her, I will
FALSTAFF:
not fail her.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
commendations to you too: and let me tell you in
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
other: and she bade me tell your worship that her
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
a man: surely I think you have charms, la, yes, in truth.
FALSTAFF:
Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my
FALSTAFF:
good parts aside I have no other charms.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Blessing on your heart for't!
FALSTAFF:
But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and
FALSTAFF:
Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
That were a jest indeed! they have not so little
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Mistress Page would desire you to send her your
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
little page, of all loves: her husband has a
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
marvellous infection to the little page, and truly
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
she will: and truly she deserves it, for if there
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
send her your page, no remedy.
FALSTAFF:
Why, I will.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
go between you both, and in any case have a
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
the boy never need to understand any thing, for
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
'tis not good that children should know any
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
as they say, and know the world.
FALSTAFF:
Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's
FALSTAFF:
my purse, I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
FALSTAFF:
this woman.
FALSTAFF:
Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBIN
FALSTAFF:
This news distracts me!
PISTOL:
This punk is one of Cupid's carriers
PISTOL:
Clap on more sails, pursue, up with your fights
PISTOL:
Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!
PISTOL:
Exit
FALSTAFF:
Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways, I'll make
FALSTAFF:
more of thy old body than I have done. Will they
FALSTAFF:
yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense
FALSTAFF:
of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I
FALSTAFF:
thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done, so it be
FALSTAFF:
fairly done, no matter.
FALSTAFF:
Enter BARDOLPH
BARDOLPH:
Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain
BARDOLPH:
speak with you, and be acquainted with you, and hath
BARDOLPH:
sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
FALSTAFF:
Brook is his name?
BARDOLPH:
Ay, sir.
FALSTAFF:
Call him in.
FALSTAFF:
Exit BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF:
Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such
FALSTAFF:
liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page
FALSTAFF:
have I encompassed you? go to, via!
FALSTAFF:
Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised
FORD:
Bless you, sir!
FALSTAFF:
And you, sir! Would you speak with me?
FORD:
I make bold to press with so little preparation upon
FORD:
you.
FALSTAFF:
You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.
FALSTAFF:
Exit BARDOLPH
FORD:
Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much, my name is Brook.
FALSTAFF:
Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.
FORD:
Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you,
FORD:
for I must let you understand I think myself in
FORD:
better plight for a lender than you are: the which
FORD:
hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned
FORD:
intrusion, for they say, if money go before, all
FORD:
ways do lie open.
FALSTAFF:
Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.
FORD:
Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me
FORD:
if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or
FORD:
half, for easing me of the carriage.
FALSTAFF:
Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.
FORD:
I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.
FALSTAFF:
Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
FALSTAFF:
your servant.
FORD:
Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief
FORD:
with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,
FORD:
though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
FORD:
myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
FORD:
thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
FORD:
own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
FORD:
one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
FORD:
turn another into the register of your own, that I
FORD:
may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
FORD:
yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.
FALSTAFF:
Very well, sir, proceed.
FORD:
There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband's
FORD:
name is Ford.
FALSTAFF:
Well, sir.
FORD:
I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,
FORD:
bestowed much on her, followed her with a doting
FORD:
observance, engrossed opportunities to meet her,
FORD:
fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
FORD:
give me sight of her, not only bought many presents
FORD:
to give her, but have given largely to many to know
FORD:
what she would have given, briefly, I have pursued
FORD:
her as love hath pursued me, which hath been on the
FORD:
wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
FORD:
merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
FORD:
I am sure, I have received none, unless experience
FORD:
be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
FORD:
rate, and that hath taught me to say this
FORD:
'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues,
FORD:
Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'
FALSTAFF:
Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?
FORD:
Never.
FALSTAFF:
Have you importuned her to such a purpose?
FORD:
Never.
FALSTAFF:
Of what quality was your love, then?
FORD:
Like a fair house built on another man's ground, so
FORD:
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
FORD:
where I erected it.
FALSTAFF:
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
FORD:
When I have told you that, I have told you all.
FORD:
Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
FORD:
other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
FORD:
there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
FORD:
John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
FORD:
gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
FORD:
discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
FORD:
place and person, generally allowed for your many
FORD:
war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.
FALSTAFF:
O, sir!
FORD:
Believe it, for you know it. There is money, spend
FORD:
it, spend it, spend more, spend all I have, only
FORD:
give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
FORD:
to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
FORD:
Ford's wife: use your art of wooing, win her to
FORD:
consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
FORD:
any.
FALSTAFF:
Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
FALSTAFF:
affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
FALSTAFF:
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
FORD:
O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on
FORD:
the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my
FORD:
soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
FORD:
be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
FORD:
with any detection in my hand, my desires had
FORD:
instance and argument to commend themselves: I
FORD:
could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
FORD:
her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
FORD:
other her defences, which now are too too strongly
FORD:
embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?
FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
FALSTAFF:
money, next, give me your hand, and last, as I am a
FALSTAFF:
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
FORD:
O good sir!
FALSTAFF:
I say you shall.
FORD:
Want no money, Sir John, you shall want none.
FALSTAFF:
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook, you shall want
FALSTAFF:
none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
FALSTAFF:
own appointment, even as you came in to me, her
FALSTAFF:
assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
FALSTAFF:
shall be with her between ten and eleven, for at
FALSTAFF:
that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
FALSTAFF:
will be forth. Come you to me at night, you shall
FALSTAFF:
know how I speed.
FORD:
I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
FORD:
sir?
FALSTAFF:
Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not
FALSTAFF:
yet I wrong him to call him poor, they say the
FALSTAFF:
jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money, for the
FALSTAFF:
which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
FALSTAFF:
use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer,
FALSTAFF:
and there's my harvest-home.
FORD:
I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
FORD:
if you saw him.
FALSTAFF:
Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
FALSTAFF:
stare him out of his wits, I will awe him with my
FALSTAFF:
cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
FALSTAFF:
cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
FALSTAFF:
will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
FALSTAFF:
lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
FALSTAFF:
Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style,
FALSTAFF:
thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
FALSTAFF:
cuckold. Come to me soon at night.
FALSTAFF:
Exit
FORD:
What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
FORD:
ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
FORD:
improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him, the
FORD:
hour is fixed, the match is made. Would any man
FORD:
have thought this? See the hell of having a false
FORD:
woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
FORD:
ransacked, my reputation gnawn at, and I shall not
FORD:
only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under
FORD:
the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
FORD:
does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
FORD:
well, Lucifer, well, Barbason, well, yet they are
FORD:
devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
FORD:
Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath
FORD:
not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
FORD:
will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will
FORD:
rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
FORD:
the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
FORD:
aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
FORD:
gelding, than my wife with herself, then she plots,
FORD:
then she ruminates, then she devises, and what they
FORD:
think in their hearts they may effect, they will
FORD:
break their hearts but they will effect. God be
FORD:
praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
FORD:
I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
FORD:
Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it,
FORD:
better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
FORD:
Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!
FORD:
Exit

Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?

Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?
FORD:
Ay, and as idle as she may hang together, for want

of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,
FORD:
you two would marry.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Be sure of that,--two other husbands.
FORD:
Where had you this pretty weather-cock?

I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my

score. He pieces out his wife's inclination, he
FORD:
gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's
FORD:
going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A
FORD:
man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And
FORD:
Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid,
FORD:
and our revolted wives share damnation together.
FORD:
Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
FORD:
the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming
FORD:
Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and
FORD:
wilful Actaeon, and to these violent proceedings all
FORD:
my neighbours shall cry aim.
FORD:
Clock heard
FORD:
The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me
FORD:
search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be
FORD:
rather praised for this than mocked, for it is as
FORD:
positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
FORD:
there: I will go.
FORD:
Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, Host, SIR HUGH EVANS, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY
PAGE:
Well met, Master Ford.
FORD:
Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home,
FORD:
and I pray you all go with me.
SHALLOW:
I must excuse myself, Master Ford.
SLENDER:
And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with
SLENDER:
Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for
SLENDER:
more money than I'll speak of.
SHALLOW:
We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and
SHALLOW:
my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.
SLENDER:
I hope I have your good will, father Page.
PAGE:
You have, Master Slender, I stand wholly for you
PAGE:
but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ay, be-gar, and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Quickly tell me so mush.
Host:
What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he
Host:
dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he
Host:
speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will
Host:
carry't, he will carry't, 'tis in his buttons, he
Host:
will carry't.
PAGE:
Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is
PAGE:
of no having: he kept company with the wild prince
PAGE:
and Poins, he is of too high a region, he knows too
PAGE:
much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes
PAGE:
with the finger of my substance: if he take her,
PAGE:
let him take her simply, the wealth I have waits on
PAGE:
my consent, and my consent goes not that way.
FORD:
I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me
FORD:
to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have
FORD:
sport, I will show you a monster. Master doctor,
FORD:
you shall go, so shall you, Master Page, and you, Sir Hugh.
SHALLOW:
Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing
SHALLOW:
at Master Page's.
SHALLOW:
Exeunt SHALLOW, and SLENDER
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Go home, John Rugby, I come anon.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Exit RUGBY
Host:
Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight
Host:
Falstaff, and drink canary with him.
Host:
Exit
FORD:
[Aside]  I think I shall drink in pipe wine first
FORD:
with him, I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?
All:
Have with you to see this monster.
All:
Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in FORD'S house.
All:
Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE
MISTRESS FORD:
What, John! What, Robert!
MISTRESS PAGE:
Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket--
MISTRESS FORD:
I warrant. What, Robin, I say!
MISTRESS FORD:
Enter Servants with a basket
MISTRESS PAGE:
Come, come, come.
MISTRESS FORD:
Here, set it down.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Give your men the charge, we must be brief.
MISTRESS FORD:
Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be
MISTRESS FORD:
ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I
MISTRESS FORD:
suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause
MISTRESS FORD:
or staggering take this basket on your shoulders
MISTRESS FORD:
that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry
MISTRESS FORD:
it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there
MISTRESS FORD:
empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.
MISTRESS PAGE:
You will do it?
MISTRESS FORD:
I ha' told them over and over, they lack no
MISTRESS FORD:
direction. Be gone, and come when you are called.
MISTRESS FORD:
Exeunt Servants
MISTRESS PAGE:
Here comes little Robin.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Enter ROBIN
MISTRESS FORD:
How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?
ROBIN:
My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,
ROBIN:
Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
MISTRESS PAGE:
You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?
ROBIN:
Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
ROBIN:
being here and hath threatened to put me into
ROBIN:
everlasting liberty if I tell you of it, for he
ROBIN:
swears he'll turn me away.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be
MISTRESS PAGE:
a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet
MISTRESS PAGE:
and hose. I'll go hide me.
MISTRESS FORD:
Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.
MISTRESS FORD:
Exit ROBIN
MISTRESS FORD:
Mistress Page, remember you your cue.
MISTRESS PAGE:
I warrant thee, if I do not act it, hiss me.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exit
MISTRESS FORD:
Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,
MISTRESS FORD:
this gross watery pumpion, we'll teach him to know
MISTRESS FORD:
turtles from jays.
MISTRESS FORD:
Enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF:
Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let
FALSTAFF:
me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the
FALSTAFF:
period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!
MISTRESS FORD:
O sweet Sir John!
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
FALSTAFF:
thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the
FALSTAFF:
best lord, I would make thee my lady.
MISTRESS FORD:
I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!
FALSTAFF:
Let the court of France show me such another. I see
FALSTAFF:
how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast
FALSTAFF:
the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
FALSTAFF:
ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
FALSTAFF:
Venetian admittance.
MISTRESS FORD:
A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing
MISTRESS FORD:
else, nor that well neither.
FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou
FALSTAFF:
wouldst make an absolute courtier, and the firm
FALSTAFF:
fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion
FALSTAFF:
to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
FALSTAFF:
what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature
FALSTAFF:
thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.
MISTRESS FORD:
Believe me, there is no such thing in me.
FALSTAFF:
What made me love thee? let that persuade thee
FALSTAFF:
there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I
FALSTAFF:
cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a
FALSTAFF:
many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like
FALSTAFF:
women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury
FALSTAFF:
in simple time, I cannot: but I love thee, none
FALSTAFF:
but thee, and thou deservest it.
MISTRESS FORD:
Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.
FALSTAFF:
Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the
FALSTAFF:
Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek
FALSTAFF:
of a lime-kiln.
MISTRESS FORD:
Well, heaven knows how I love you, and you shall one
MISTRESS FORD:
day find it.
FALSTAFF:
Keep in that mind, I'll deserve it.
MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, I must tell you, so you do, or else I could not
MISTRESS FORD:
be in that mind.
ROBIN:
[Within]  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's
ROBIN:
Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and
ROBIN:
looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.
FALSTAFF:
She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.
MISTRESS FORD:
Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.
MISTRESS FORD:
FALSTAFF hides himself
MISTRESS FORD:
Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN
MISTRESS FORD:
What's the matter? how now!
MISTRESS PAGE:
O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
MISTRESS PAGE:
you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!
MISTRESS FORD:
What's the matter, good Mistress Page?
MISTRESS PAGE:
O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man
MISTRESS PAGE:
to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!
MISTRESS FORD:
What cause of suspicion?
MISTRESS PAGE:
What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I
MISTRESS PAGE:
mistook in you!
MISTRESS FORD:
Why, alas, what's the matter?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the
MISTRESS PAGE:
officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that
MISTRESS PAGE:
he says is here now in the house by your consent, to
MISTRESS PAGE:
take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.
MISTRESS FORD:
'Tis not so, I hope.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man
MISTRESS PAGE:
here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,
MISTRESS PAGE:
with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a
MISTRESS PAGE:
one. I come before to tell you. If you know
MISTRESS PAGE:
yourself clear, why, I am glad of it, but if you
MISTRESS PAGE:
have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not
MISTRESS PAGE:
amazed, call all your senses to you, defend your
MISTRESS PAGE:
reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.
MISTRESS FORD:
What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear
MISTRESS FORD:
friend, and I fear not mine own shame so much as his
MISTRESS FORD:
peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were
MISTRESS FORD:
out of the house.
MISTRESS PAGE:
For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you
MISTRESS PAGE:
had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink
MISTRESS PAGE:
you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot
MISTRESS PAGE:
hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here
MISTRESS PAGE:
is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he
MISTRESS PAGE:
may creep in here, and throw foul linen upon him, as
MISTRESS PAGE:
if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time
MISTRESS PAGE:
--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.
MISTRESS FORD:
He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?
FALSTAFF:
[Coming forward]  Let me see't, let me see't, O, let
FALSTAFF:
me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
FALSTAFF:
counsel. I'll in.
MISTRESS PAGE:
What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?
FALSTAFF:
I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.
FALSTAFF:
I'll never--
FALSTAFF:
Gets into the basket, they cover him with foul linen
MISTRESS PAGE:
Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!
MISTRESS FORD:
What, John! Robert! John!
MISTRESS FORD:
Exit ROBIN
MISTRESS FORD:
Re-enter Servants
MISTRESS FORD:
Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where's the
MISTRESS FORD:
cowl-staff? look, how you drumble! Carry them to
MISTRESS FORD:
the laundress in Datchet-meat, quickly, come.
MISTRESS FORD:
Enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS
FORD:
Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,
FORD:
why then make sport at me, then let me be your jest,
FORD:
I deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?
Servant:
To the laundress, forsooth.
MISTRESS FORD:
Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You
MISTRESS FORD:
were best meddle with buck-washing.
FORD:
Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!
FORD:
Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck, I warrant you, buck,
FORD:
and of the season too, it shall appear.
FORD:
Exeunt Servants with the basket
FORD:
Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night, I'll tell you my
FORD:
dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my
FORD:
chambers, search, seek, find out: I'll warrant
FORD:
we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.
FORD:
Locking the door
FORD:
So, now uncape.
PAGE:
Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.
FORD:
True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see
FORD:
sport anon: follow me, gentlemen.
FORD:
Exit
SIR HUGH EVANS:
This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France, it is not
DOCTOR CAIUS:
jealous in France.
PAGE:
Nay, follow him, gentlemen, see the issue of his search.
PAGE:
Exeunt PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS
MISTRESS PAGE:
Is there not a double excellency in this?
MISTRESS FORD:
I know not which pleases me better, that my husband
MISTRESS FORD:
is deceived, or Sir John.
MISTRESS PAGE:
What a taking was he in when your husband asked who
MISTRESS PAGE:
was in the basket!
MISTRESS FORD:
I am half afraid he will have need of washing, so
MISTRESS FORD:
throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same
MISTRESS PAGE:
strain were in the same distress.
MISTRESS FORD:
I think my husband hath some special suspicion of
MISTRESS FORD:
Falstaff's being here, for I never saw him so gross
MISTRESS FORD:
in his jealousy till now.
MISTRESS PAGE:
I will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have
MISTRESS PAGE:
more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will
MISTRESS PAGE:
scarce obey this medicine.
MISTRESS FORD:
Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
MISTRESS FORD:
Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the
MISTRESS FORD:
water, and give him another hope, to betray him to
MISTRESS FORD:
another punishment?
MISTRESS PAGE:
We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,
MISTRESS PAGE:
eight o'clock, to have amends.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Re-enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS
FORD:
I cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that
FORD:
he could not compass.
MISTRESS PAGE:
[Aside to MISTRESS FORD]  Heard you that?
MISTRESS FORD:
You use me well, Master Ford, do you?
FORD:
Ay, I do so.
MISTRESS FORD:
Heaven make you better than your thoughts!
FORD:
Amen!
MISTRESS PAGE:
You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.
FORD:
Ay, ay, I must bear it.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
If there be any pody in the house, and in the
SIR HUGH EVANS:
chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!
DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.
PAGE:
Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What
PAGE:
spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I
PAGE:
would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the
PAGE:
wealth of Windsor Castle.
FORD:
'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as
SIR HUGH EVANS:
honest a 'omans as I will desires among five
SIR HUGH EVANS:
thousand, and five hundred too.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.
FORD:
Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in
FORD:
the Park: I pray you, pardon me, I will hereafter
FORD:
make known to you why I have done this. Come,
FORD:
wife, come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me,
FORD:
pray heartily, pardon me.
PAGE:
Let's go in, gentlemen, but, trust me, we'll mock
PAGE:
him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house
PAGE:
to breakfast: after, we'll a-birding together, I
PAGE:
have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?
FORD:
Any thing.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
If there is one, I shall make two in the company.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.
FORD:
Pray you, go, Master Page.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy
SIR HUGH EVANS:
knave, mine host.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Dat is good, by gar, with all my heart!
SIR HUGH EVANS:
A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Exeunt
SIR HUGH EVANS:
SCENE IV. A room in PAGE'S house.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE
FENTON:
I see I cannot get thy father's love,
FENTON:
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
ANNE PAGE:
Alas, how then?
FENTON:
Why, thou must be thyself.
FENTON:
He doth object I am too great of birth--,
FENTON:
And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
FENTON:
I seek to heal it only by his wealth
FENTON:
Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
FENTON:
My riots past, my wild societies,
FENTON:
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
FENTON:
I should love thee but as a property.
ANNE PAGE:
May be he tells you true.
FENTON:
No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
FENTON:
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
FENTON:
Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne
FENTON:
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
FENTON:
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags,
FENTON:
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
FENTON:
That now I aim at.
ANNE PAGE:
Gentle Master Fenton,
ANNE PAGE:
Yet seek my father's love, still seek it, sir
ANNE PAGE:
If opportunity and humblest suit
ANNE PAGE:
Cannot attain it, why, then,--hark you hither!
ANNE PAGE:
They converse apart
ANNE PAGE:
Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and MISTRESS QUICKLY
SHALLOW:
Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman shall
SHALLOW:
speak for himself.
SLENDER:
I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but
SLENDER:
venturing.
SHALLOW:
Be not dismayed.
SLENDER:
No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that,
SLENDER:
but that I am afeard.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Hark ye, Master Slender would speak a word with you.
ANNE PAGE:
I come to him.
ANNE PAGE:
Aside
ANNE PAGE:
This is my father's choice.
ANNE PAGE:
O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults
ANNE PAGE:
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.
SHALLOW:
She's coming, to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!
SLENDER:
I had a father, Mistress Anne, my uncle can tell you
SLENDER:
good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress
SLENDER:
Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of
SLENDER:
a pen, good uncle.
SHALLOW:
Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.
SLENDER:
Ay, that I do, as well as I love any woman in
SLENDER:
Gloucestershire.
SHALLOW:
He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
SLENDER:
Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the
SLENDER:
degree of a squire.
SHALLOW:
He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.
ANNE PAGE:
Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.
SHALLOW:
Marry, I thank you for it, I thank you for that good
SHALLOW:
comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.
ANNE PAGE:
Now, Master Slender,--
SLENDER:
Now, good Mistress Anne,--
ANNE PAGE:
What is your will?
SLENDER:
My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
SLENDER:
indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven, I
SLENDER:
am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.
ANNE PAGE:
I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
SLENDER:
Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing
SLENDER:
with you. Your father and my uncle hath made
SLENDER:
motions: if it be my luck, so, if not, happy man be
SLENDER:
his dole! They can tell you how things go better
SLENDER:
than I can: you may ask your father, here he comes.
SLENDER:
Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE
PAGE:
Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
PAGE:
Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?
PAGE:
You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house
PAGE:
I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.
FENTON:
Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
PAGE:
She is no match for you.
FENTON:
Sir, will you hear me?
PAGE:
No, good Master Fenton.
PAGE:
Come, Master Shallow, come, son Slender, in.
PAGE:
Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
PAGE:
Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Speak to Mistress Page.
FENTON:
Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
FENTON:
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
FENTON:
Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,
FENTON:
I must advance the colours of my love
FENTON:
And not retire: let me have your good will.
ANNE PAGE:
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
MISTRESS PAGE:
I mean it not, I seek you a better husband.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
That's my master, master doctor.
ANNE PAGE:
Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth
ANNE PAGE:
And bowl'd to death with turnips!
MISTRESS PAGE:
Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
MISTRESS PAGE:
I will not be your friend nor enemy
MISTRESS PAGE:
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
MISTRESS PAGE:
And as I find her, so am I affected.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Her father will be angry.
FENTON:
Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.
FENTON:
Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ANNE PAGE
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Master Fenton:' this is my doing.
FENTON:
I thank thee, and I pray thee, once to-night
FENTON:
Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Now heaven send thee good fortune!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Exit FENTON
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
would my master had Mistress Anne, or I would
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Master Slender had her, or, in sooth, I would Master
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Fenton had her, I will do what I can for them all
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
three, for so I have promised, and I'll be as good
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
as my word, but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Exit
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, I say,--
BARDOLPH:
Here, sir.
FALSTAFF:
Go fetch me a quart of sack, put a toast in't.
FALSTAFF:
Exit BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF:
Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a
FALSTAFF:
barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the
FALSTAFF:
Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,
FALSTAFF:
I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
FALSTAFF:
them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues
FALSTAFF:
slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
FALSTAFF:
they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,
FALSTAFF:
fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size
FALSTAFF:
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking, if the
FALSTAFF:
bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had
FALSTAFF:
been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and
FALSTAFF:
shallow,--a death that I abhor, for the water swells
FALSTAFF:
a man, and what a thing should I have been when I
FALSTAFF:
had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.
FALSTAFF:
Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack
BARDOLPH:
Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.
FALSTAFF:
Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water, for my
FALSTAFF:
belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for
FALSTAFF:
pills to cool the reins. Call her in.
BARDOLPH:
Come in, woman!
BARDOLPH:
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
By your leave, I cry you mercy: give your worship
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
good morrow.
FALSTAFF:
Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of
FALSTAFF:
sack finely.
BARDOLPH:
With eggs, sir?
FALSTAFF:
Simple of itself, I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.
FALSTAFF:
Exit BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF:
How now!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough, I was thrown
FALSTAFF:
into the ford, I have my belly full of ford.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
she does so take on with her men, they mistook their erection.
FALSTAFF:
So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
a-birding, she desires you once more to come to her
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
between eight and nine: I must carry her word
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.
FALSTAFF:
Well, I will visit her: tell her so, and bid her
FALSTAFF:
think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,
FALSTAFF:
and then judge of my merit.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I will tell her.
FALSTAFF:
Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Eight and nine, sir.
FALSTAFF:
Well, be gone: I will not miss her.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Peace be with you, sir.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Exit
FALSTAFF:
I marvel I hear not of Master Brook, he sent me word
FALSTAFF:
to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.
FALSTAFF:
Enter FORD
FORD:
Bless you, sir!
FALSTAFF:
Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed
FALSTAFF:
between me and Ford's wife?
FORD:
That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.
FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her
FALSTAFF:
house the hour she appointed me.
FORD:
And sped you, sir?
FALSTAFF:
Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
FORD:
How so, sir? Did she change her determination?
FALSTAFF:
No, Master Brook, but the peaking Cornuto her
FALSTAFF:
husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
FALSTAFF:
'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
FALSTAFF:
encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
FALSTAFF:
and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy,
FALSTAFF:
and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
FALSTAFF:
provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
FALSTAFF:
forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.
FORD:
What, while you were there?
FALSTAFF:
While I was there.
FORD:
And did he search for you, and could not find you?
FALSTAFF:
You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
FALSTAFF:
in one Mistress Page, gives intelligence of Ford's
FALSTAFF:
approach, and, in her invention and Ford's wife's
FALSTAFF:
distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.
FORD:
A buck-basket!
FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul
FALSTAFF:
shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
FALSTAFF:
napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
FALSTAFF:
compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.
FORD:
And how long lay you there?
FALSTAFF:
Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
FALSTAFF:
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
FALSTAFF:
Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
FALSTAFF:
knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
FALSTAFF:
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
FALSTAFF:
Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders, met
FALSTAFF:
the jealous knave their master in the door, who
FALSTAFF:
asked them once or twice what they had in their
FALSTAFF:
basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
FALSTAFF:
would have searched it, but fate, ordaining he
FALSTAFF:
should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
FALSTAFF:
for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
FALSTAFF:
mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
FALSTAFF:
of three several deaths, first, an intolerable
FALSTAFF:
fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
FALSTAFF:
bell-wether, next, to be compassed, like a good
FALSTAFF:
bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
FALSTAFF:
point, heel to head, and then, to be stopped in,
FALSTAFF:
like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
FALSTAFF:
that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a
FALSTAFF:
man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject
FALSTAFF:
to heat as butter, a man of continual dissolution
FALSTAFF:
and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
FALSTAFF:
And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
FALSTAFF:
half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
FALSTAFF:
thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
FALSTAFF:
in that surge, like a horse-shoe, think of
FALSTAFF:
that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.
FORD:
In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you
FORD:
have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate,
FORD:
you'll undertake her no more?
FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have
FALSTAFF:
been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
FALSTAFF:
husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
FALSTAFF:
received from her another embassy of meeting, 'twixt
FALSTAFF:
eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
FORD:
'Tis past eight already, sir.
FALSTAFF:
Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
FALSTAFF:
Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
FALSTAFF:
know how I speed, and the conclusion shall be
FALSTAFF:
crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
FALSTAFF:
have her, Master Brook, Master Brook, you shall
FALSTAFF:
cuckold Ford.
FALSTAFF:
Exit
FORD:
Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I
FORD:
sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!
FORD:
there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
FORD:
This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen
FORD:
and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
FORD:
what I am: I will now take the lecher, he is at my
FORD:
house, he cannot 'scape me, 'tis impossible he
FORD:
should, he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
FORD:
nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
FORD:
guides him should aid him, I will search
FORD:
impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
FORD:
yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame
FORD:
if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
FORD:
with me: I'll be horn-mad.
FORD:
Exit

ACT IV
FORD:
SCENE I. A street.
FORD:
Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS QUICKLY, and WILLIAM PAGE
MISTRESS PAGE:
Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Sure he is by this, or will be presently: but,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.
MISTRESS PAGE:
I'll be with her by and by, I'll but bring my young
MISTRESS PAGE:
man here to school. Look, where his master comes,
MISTRESS PAGE:
'tis a playing-day, I see.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Enter SIR HUGH EVANS
MISTRESS PAGE:
How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day?
SIR HUGH EVANS:
No, Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Blessing of his heart!
MISTRESS PAGE:
Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in
MISTRESS PAGE:
the world at his book. I pray you, ask him some
MISTRESS PAGE:
questions in his accidence.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Come hither, William, hold up your head, come.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Come on, sirrah, hold up your head, answer your
MISTRESS PAGE:
master, be not afraid.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
William, how many numbers is in nouns?
WILLIAM PAGE:
Two.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Truly, I thought there had been one number more,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
because they say, ''Od's nouns.'
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Peace your tattlings! What is 'fair,' William?
WILLIAM PAGE:
Pulcher.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats, sure.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
You are a very simplicity 'oman: I pray you peace.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
What is 'lapis,' William?
WILLIAM PAGE:
A stone.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
And what is 'a stone,' William?
WILLIAM PAGE:
A pebble.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
No, it is 'lapis:' I pray you, remember in your prain.
WILLIAM PAGE:
Lapis.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
That is a good William. What is he, William, that
SIR HUGH EVANS:
does lend articles?
WILLIAM PAGE:
Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus
WILLIAM PAGE:
declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Nominativo, hig, hag, hog, pray you, mark
SIR HUGH EVANS:
genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?
WILLIAM PAGE:
Accusativo, hinc.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
I pray you, have your remembrance, child,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
accusative, hung, hang, hog.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Leave your prabbles, 'oman. What is the focative
SIR HUGH EVANS:
case, William?
WILLIAM PAGE:
O,--vocativo, O.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Remember, William, focative is caret.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And that's a good root.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Oman, forbear.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Peace!
SIR HUGH EVANS:
What is your genitive case plural, William?
WILLIAM PAGE:
Genitive case!
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Ay.
WILLIAM PAGE:
Genitive,--horum, harum, horum.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Vengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her! never name
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
her, child, if she be a whore.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
For shame, 'oman.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
You do ill to teach the child such words: he
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
fast enough of themselves, and to call 'horum:' fie upon you!
SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Oman, art thou lunatics? hast thou no
SIR HUGH EVANS:
understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the
SIR HUGH EVANS:
genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as
SIR HUGH EVANS:
I would desires.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Prithee, hold thy peace.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.
WILLIAM PAGE:
Forsooth, I have forgot.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your 'quies,'
SIR HUGH EVANS:
your 'quaes,' and your 'quods,' you must be
SIR HUGH EVANS:
preeches. Go your ways, and play, go.
MISTRESS PAGE:
He is a better scholar than I thought he was.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Adieu, good Sir Hugh.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exit SIR HUGH EVANS
MISTRESS PAGE:
Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exeunt
MISTRESS PAGE:
SCENE II. A room in FORD'S house.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
FALSTAFF:
sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
FALSTAFF:
and I profess requital to a hair's breadth, not
FALSTAFF:
only, Mistress Ford, in the simple
FALSTAFF:
office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
FALSTAFF:
complement and ceremony of it. But are you
FALSTAFF:
sure of your husband now?
MISTRESS FORD:
He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.
MISTRESS PAGE:
[Within]  What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!
MISTRESS FORD:
Step into the chamber, Sir John.
MISTRESS FORD:
Exit FALSTAFF
MISTRESS FORD:
Enter MISTRESS PAGE
MISTRESS PAGE:
How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?
MISTRESS FORD:
Why, none but mine own people.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Indeed!
MISTRESS FORD:
No, certainly.
MISTRESS FORD:
Aside to her
MISTRESS FORD:
Speak louder.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.
MISTRESS FORD:
Why?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again
MISTRESS PAGE:
he so takes on yonder with my husband, so rails
MISTRESS PAGE:
against all married mankind, so curses all Eve's
MISTRESS PAGE:
daughters, of what complexion soever, and so buffets
MISTRESS PAGE:
himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer
MISTRESS PAGE:
out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
MISTRESS PAGE:
tameness, civility and patience, to this his
MISTRESS PAGE:
distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.
MISTRESS FORD:
Why, does he talk of him?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Of none but him, and swears he was carried out, the
MISTRESS PAGE:
last time he searched for him, in a basket, protests
MISTRESS PAGE:
to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
MISTRESS PAGE:
the rest of their company from their sport, to make
MISTRESS PAGE:
another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad
MISTRESS PAGE:
the knight is not here, now he shall see his own foolery.
MISTRESS FORD:
How near is he, Mistress Page?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Hard by, at street end, he will be here anon.
MISTRESS FORD:
I am undone! The knight is here.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead
MISTRESS PAGE:
man. What a woman are you!--Away with him, away
MISTRESS PAGE:
with him! better shame than murder.
FORD:
Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?
FORD:
Shall I put him into the basket again?
FORD:
Re-enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF:
No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go
FALSTAFF:
out ere he come?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door
MISTRESS PAGE:
with pistols, that none shall issue out, otherwise
MISTRESS PAGE:
you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?
FALSTAFF:
What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.
MISTRESS FORD:
There they always use to discharge their
MISTRESS FORD:
birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.
FALSTAFF:
Where is it?
MISTRESS FORD:
He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
MISTRESS FORD:
coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
MISTRESS FORD:
abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
MISTRESS FORD:
goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.
FALSTAFF:
I'll go out then.
MISTRESS PAGE:
If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir
MISTRESS PAGE:
John. Unless you go out disguised--
MISTRESS FORD:
How might we disguise him?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown
MISTRESS PAGE:
big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
MISTRESS PAGE:
a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.
FALSTAFF:
Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather
FALSTAFF:
than a mischief.
MISTRESS FORD:
My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a
MISTRESS FORD:
gown above.
MISTRESS PAGE:
On my word, it will serve him, she's as big as he
MISTRESS PAGE:
is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler
MISTRESS PAGE:
too. Run up, Sir John.
MISTRESS FORD:
Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will
MISTRESS FORD:
look some linen for your head.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put
MISTRESS PAGE:
on the gown the while.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exit FALSTAFF
MISTRESS FORD:
I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he
MISTRESS FORD:
cannot abide the old woman of Brentford, he swears
MISTRESS FORD:
she's a witch, forbade her my house and hath
MISTRESS FORD:
threatened to beat her.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the
MISTRESS PAGE:
devil guide his cudgel afterwards!
MISTRESS FORD:
But is my husband coming?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Ah, in good sadness, is he, and talks of the basket
MISTRESS PAGE:
too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.
MISTRESS FORD:
We'll try that, for I'll appoint my men to carry the
MISTRESS FORD:
basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as
MISTRESS FORD:
they did last time.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him
MISTRESS PAGE:
like the witch of Brentford.
MISTRESS FORD:
I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the
MISTRESS FORD:
basket. Go up, I'll bring linen for him straight.
MISTRESS FORD:
Exit
MISTRESS PAGE:
Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.
MISTRESS PAGE:
We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Wives may be merry, and yet honest too
MISTRESS PAGE:
We do not act that often jest and laugh,
MISTRESS PAGE:
'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exit
MISTRESS PAGE:
Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants
MISTRESS FORD:
Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders
MISTRESS FORD:
your master is hard at door, if he bid you set it
MISTRESS FORD:
down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.
MISTRESS FORD:
Exit
First Servant:
Come, come, take it up.
Second Servant:
Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.
First Servant:
I hope not, I had as lief bear so much lead.
First Servant:
Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS
FORD:
Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any
FORD:
way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,
FORD:
villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!
FORD:
O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a
FORD:
pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil
FORD:
be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!
FORD:
Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!
PAGE:
Why, this passes, Master Ford, you are not to go
PAGE:
loose any longer, you must be pinioned.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!
SHALLOW:
Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.
FORD:
So say I too, sir.
FORD:
Re-enter MISTRESS FORD
FORD:
Come hither, Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford the honest
FORD:
woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that
FORD:
hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect
FORD:
without cause, mistress, do I?
MISTRESS FORD:
Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in
MISTRESS FORD:
any dishonesty.
FORD:
Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!
FORD:
Pulling clothes out of the basket
PAGE:
This passes!
MISTRESS FORD:
Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.
FORD:
I shall find you anon.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's
SIR HUGH EVANS:
clothes? Come away.
FORD:
Empty the basket, I say!
MISTRESS FORD:
Why, man, why?
FORD:
Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed
FORD:
out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
FORD:
not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is
FORD:
my intelligence is true, my jealousy is reasonable.
FORD:
Pluck me out all the linen.
MISTRESS FORD:
If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.
PAGE:
Here's no man.
SHALLOW:
By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford, this
SHALLOW:
wrongs you.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the
SIR HUGH EVANS:
imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.
FORD:
Well, he's not here I seek for.
PAGE:
No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.
FORD:
Help to search my house this one time. If I find
FORD:
not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity, let
FORD:
me for ever be your table-sport, let them say of
FORD:
me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
FORD:
walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more,
FORD:
once more search with me.
MISTRESS FORD:
What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old woman
MISTRESS FORD:
down, my husband will come into the chamber.
FORD:
Old woman! what old woman's that?
MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.
FORD:
A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not
FORD:
forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does
FORD:
she? We are simple men, we do not know what's
FORD:
brought to pass under the profession of
FORD:
fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,
FORD:
by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond
FORD:
our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,
FORD:
you hag, you, come down, I say!
MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him
MISTRESS FORD:
not strike the old woman.
MISTRESS FORD:
Re-enter FALSTAFF in woman's clothes, and MISTRESS PAGE
MISTRESS PAGE:
Come, Mother Prat, come, give me your hand.
FORD:
I'll prat her.
FORD:
Beating him
FORD:
Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you
FORD:
polecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,
FORD:
I'll fortune-tell you.
FORD:
Exit FALSTAFF
MISTRESS PAGE:
Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the
MISTRESS PAGE:
poor woman.
MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.
FORD:
Hang her, witch!
SIR HUGH EVANS:
By the yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch
SIR HUGH EVANS:
indeed: I like not when a 'oman has a great peard,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
I spy a great peard under his muffler.
FORD:
Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow,
FORD:
see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus
FORD:
upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.
PAGE:
Let's obey his humour a little further: come,
PAGE:
gentlemen.
PAGE:
Exeunt FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS
MISTRESS PAGE:
Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.
MISTRESS FORD:
Nay, by the mass, that he did not, he beat him most
MISTRESS FORD:
unpitifully, methought.
MISTRESS PAGE:
I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the
MISTRESS PAGE:
altar, it hath done meritorious service.
MISTRESS FORD:
What think you? may we, with the warrant of
MISTRESS FORD:
womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,
MISTRESS FORD:
pursue him with any further revenge?
MISTRESS PAGE:
The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of
MISTRESS PAGE:
him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with
MISTRESS PAGE:
fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the
MISTRESS PAGE:
way of waste, attempt us again.
MISTRESS FORD:
Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Yes, by all means, if it be but to scrape the
MISTRESS PAGE:
figures out of your husband's brains. If they can
MISTRESS PAGE:
find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight
MISTRESS PAGE:
shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be
MISTRESS PAGE:
the ministers.
MISTRESS FORD:
I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and
MISTRESS FORD:
methinks there would be no period to the jest,
MISTRESS FORD:
should he not be publicly shamed.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Come, to the forge with it then, shape it: I would
MISTRESS PAGE:
not have things cool.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exeunt
MISTRESS PAGE:
SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Enter Host and BARDOLPH
BARDOLPH:
Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
BARDOLPH:
horses: the duke himself will be to-morrow at
BARDOLPH:
court, and they are going to meet him.
Host:
What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear
Host:
not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
Host:
gentlemen: they speak English?
BARDOLPH:
Ay, sir, I'll call them to you.
Host:
They shall have my horses, but I'll make them pay,
Host:
I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at
Host:
command, I have turned away my other guests: they
Host:
must come off, I'll sauce them. Come.
Host:
Exeunt
Host:
SCENE IV. A room in FORD'S house.
Host:
Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS
SIR HUGH EVANS:
'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever
SIR HUGH EVANS:
I did look upon.
PAGE:
And did he send you both these letters at an instant?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Within a quarter of an hour.
FORD:
Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt,
FORD:
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
FORD:
Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand
FORD:
In him that was of late an heretic,
FORD:
As firm as faith.
PAGE:
'Tis well, 'tis well, no more
PAGE:
Be not as extreme in submission
PAGE:
As in offence.
PAGE:
But let our plot go forward: let our wives
PAGE:
Yet once again, to make us public sport,
PAGE:
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
PAGE:
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.
FORD:
There is no better way than that they spoke of.
PAGE:
How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park
PAGE:
at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
SIR HUGH EVANS:
been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks
SIR HUGH EVANS:
there should be terrors in him that he should not
SIR HUGH EVANS:
come, methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have
SIR HUGH EVANS:
no desires.
PAGE:
So think I too.
MISTRESS FORD:
Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
MISTRESS FORD:
And let us two devise to bring him thither.
MISTRESS PAGE:
There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns,
MISTRESS PAGE:
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
MISTRESS PAGE:
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
MISTRESS PAGE:
In a most hideous and dreadful manner
MISTRESS PAGE:
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
MISTRESS PAGE:
The superstitious idle-headed eld
MISTRESS PAGE:
Received and did deliver to our age
MISTRESS PAGE:
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.
PAGE:
Why, yet there want not many that do fear
PAGE:
In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak
PAGE:
But what of this?
MISTRESS FORD:
Marry, this is our device,
MISTRESS FORD:
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.
PAGE:
Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come
PAGE:
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
PAGE:
What shall be done with him? what is your plot?
MISTRESS PAGE:
That likewise have we thought upon, and thus
MISTRESS PAGE:
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
MISTRESS PAGE:
And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
MISTRESS PAGE:
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
MISTRESS PAGE:
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
MISTRESS PAGE:
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
MISTRESS PAGE:
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
MISTRESS PAGE:
With some diffused song: upon their sight,
MISTRESS PAGE:
We two in great amazedness will fly
MISTRESS PAGE:
Then let them all encircle him about
MISTRESS PAGE:
And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,
MISTRESS PAGE:
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
MISTRESS PAGE:
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
MISTRESS PAGE:
In shape profane.
MISTRESS FORD:
And till he tell the truth,
MISTRESS FORD:
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
MISTRESS FORD:
And burn him with their tapers.
MISTRESS PAGE:
The truth being known,
MISTRESS PAGE:
We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
MISTRESS PAGE:
And mock him home to Windsor.
FORD:
The children must
FORD:
Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
I will teach the children their behaviors, and I
SIR HUGH EVANS:
will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the
SIR HUGH EVANS:
knight with my taber.
FORD:
That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.
MISTRESS PAGE:
My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Finely attired in a robe of white.
PAGE:
That silk will I go buy.
PAGE:
Aside
PAGE:
And in that time
PAGE:
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
PAGE:
And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.
FORD:
Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
FORD:
He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Fear not you that. Go get us properties
MISTRESS PAGE:
And tricking for our fairies.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery
SIR HUGH EVANS:
honest knaveries.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS
MISTRESS PAGE:
Go, Mistress Ford,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exit MISTRESS FORD
MISTRESS PAGE:
I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,
MISTRESS PAGE:
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
MISTRESS PAGE:
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot,
MISTRESS PAGE:
And he my husband best of all affects.
MISTRESS PAGE:
The doctor is well money'd, and his friends
MISTRESS PAGE:
Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exit

SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Enter Host and SIMPLE
Host:
What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin?
Host:
speak, breathe, discuss, brief, short, quick, snap.
SIMPLE:
Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
SIMPLE:
from Master Slender.
Host:
There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
Host:
standing-bed and truckle-bed, 'tis painted about
Host:
with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go
Host:
knock and call, hell speak like an Anthropophaginian
Host:
unto thee: knock, I say.
SIMPLE:
There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his
SIMPLE:
chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come
SIMPLE:
down, I come to speak with her, indeed.
Host:
Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll
Host:
call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
Host:
thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine
Host:
host, thine Ephesian, calls.
FALSTAFF:
[Above]  How now, mine host!
Host:
Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of
Host:
thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her
Host:
descend, my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?
Host:
fie!
Host:
Enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF:
There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with
FALSTAFF:
me,  but she's gone.
SIMPLE:
Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
SIMPLE:
Brentford?
FALSTAFF:
Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?
SIMPLE:
My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing
SIMPLE:
her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
SIMPLE:
one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the
SIMPLE:
chain or no.
FALSTAFF:
I spake with the old woman about it.
SIMPLE:
And what says she, I pray, sir?
FALSTAFF:
Marry, she says that the very same man that
FALSTAFF:
beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of
FALSTAFF:
it.
SIMPLE:
I would I could have spoken with the woman herself,
SIMPLE:
I had other things to have spoken with her too from
SIMPLE:
him.
FALSTAFF:
What are they? let us know.
Host:
Ay, come, quick.
SIMPLE:
I may not conceal them, sir.
Host:
Conceal them, or thou diest.
SIMPLE:
Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne
SIMPLE:
Page, to know if it were my master's fortune to
SIMPLE:
have her or no.
FALSTAFF:
'Tis, 'tis his fortune.
SIMPLE:
What, sir?
FALSTAFF:
To have her, or no. Go, say the woman told me so.
SIMPLE:
May I be bold to say so, sir?
FALSTAFF:
Ay, sir, like who more bold.
SIMPLE:
I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad
SIMPLE:
with these tidings.
SIMPLE:
Exit
Host:
Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was
Host:
there a wise woman with thee?
FALSTAFF:
Ay, that there was, mine host, one that hath taught
FALSTAFF:
me more wit than ever I learned before in my life,
FALSTAFF:
and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for
FALSTAFF:
my learning.
FALSTAFF:
Enter BARDOLPH
BARDOLPH:
Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!
Host:
Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.
BARDOLPH:
Run away with the cozeners, for so soon as I came
BARDOLPH:
beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
BARDOLPH:
them, in a slough of mire, and set spurs and away,
BARDOLPH:
like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.
Host:
They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not
Host:
say they be fled, Germans are honest men.
Host:
Enter SIR HUGH EVANS
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Where is mine host?
Host:
What is the matter, sir?
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Have a care of your entertainments: there is a
SIR HUGH EVANS:
friend of mine come to town tells me there is three
SIR HUGH EVANS:
cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and
SIR HUGH EVANS:
money. I tell you for good will, look you: you
SIR HUGH EVANS:
are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and
SIR HUGH EVANS:
'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Exit
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Enter DOCTOR CAIUS
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vere is mine host de Jarteer?
Host:
Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat
DOCTOR CAIUS:
you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by
DOCTOR CAIUS:
my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to
DOCTOR CAIUS:
come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Exit
Host:
Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am
Host:
undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!
Host:
Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF:
I would all the world might be cozened, for I have
FALSTAFF:
been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
FALSTAFF:
the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
FALSTAFF:
and how my transformation hath been washed and
FALSTAFF:
cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
FALSTAFF:
drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me, I warrant
FALSTAFF:
they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
FALSTAFF:
as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
FALSTAFF:
since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my
FALSTAFF:
wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.
FALSTAFF:
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
FALSTAFF:
Now, whence come you?
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
From the two parties, forsooth.
FALSTAFF:
The devil take one party and his dam the other! and
FALSTAFF:
so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more
FALSTAFF:
for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy
FALSTAFF:
of man's disposition is able to bear.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
speciously one of them, Mistress Ford, good heart,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
white spot about her.
FALSTAFF:
What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
FALSTAFF:
beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow,
FALSTAFF:
and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
FALSTAFF:
Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,
FALSTAFF:
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
FALSTAFF:
delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the
FALSTAFF:
stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
shall hear how things go, and, I warrant, to your
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
you are so crossed.
FALSTAFF:
Come up into my chamber.
FALSTAFF:
Exeunt
FALSTAFF:
SCENE VI. Another room in the Garter Inn.
FALSTAFF:
Enter FENTON and Host
Host:
Master Fenton, talk not to me, my mind is heavy: I
Host:
will give over all.
FENTON:
Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
FENTON:
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
FENTON:
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
Host:
I will hear you, Master Fenton, and I will at the
Host:
least keep your counsel.
FENTON:
From time to time I have acquainted you
FENTON:
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page,
FENTON:
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
FENTON:
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
FENTON:
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
FENTON:
Of such contents as you will wonder at,
FENTON:
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
FENTON:
That neither singly can be manifested,
FENTON:
Without the show of both, fat Falstaff
FENTON:
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
FENTON:
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
FENTON:
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
FENTON:
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen,
FENTON:
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
FENTON:
While other jests are something rank on foot,
FENTON:
Her father hath commanded her to slip
FENTON:
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
FENTON:
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
FENTON:
Her mother, ever strong against that match
FENTON:
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
FENTON:
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
FENTON:
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
FENTON:
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
FENTON:
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
FENTON:
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
FENTON:
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests
FENTON:
Her father means she shall be all in white,
FENTON:
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
FENTON:
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
FENTON:
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
FENTON:
The better to denote her to the doctor,
FENTON:
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
FENTON:
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
FENTON:
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head,
FENTON:
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
FENTON:
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
FENTON:
The maid hath given consent to go with him.
Host:
Which means she to deceive, father or mother?
FENTON:
Both, my good host, to go along with me
FENTON:
And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
FENTON:
To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
FENTON:
And, in the lawful name of marrying,
FENTON:
To give our hearts united ceremony.
Host:
Well, husband your device, I'll to the vicar
Host:
Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.
FENTON:
So shall I evermore be bound to thee,
FENTON:
Besides, I'll make a present recompense.
FENTON:
Exeunt
FENTON:
ACT V
FENTON:
SCENE I. A room in the Garter Inn.
FENTON:
Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS QUICKLY
FALSTAFF:
Prithee, no more prattling, go. I'll hold. This is
FALSTAFF:
the third time, I hope good luck lies in odd
FALSTAFF:
numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in
FALSTAFF:
odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
I'll provide you a chain, and I'll do what I can to
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
get you a pair of horns.
FALSTAFF:
Away, I say, time wears: hold up your head, and mince.
FALSTAFF:
Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY
FALSTAFF:
Enter FORD
FALSTAFF:
How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter
FALSTAFF:
will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the
FALSTAFF:
Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall
FALSTAFF:
see wonders.
FORD:
Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me
FORD:
you had appointed?
FALSTAFF:
I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor
FALSTAFF:
old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a
FALSTAFF:
poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,
FALSTAFF:
hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,
FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
FALSTAFF:
you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
FALSTAFF:
woman, for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear
FALSTAFF:
not Goliath with a weaver's beam, because I know
FALSTAFF:
also life is a shuttle. I am in haste, go along
FALSTAFF:
with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I
FALSTAFF:
plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew
FALSTAFF:
not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow
FALSTAFF:
me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave
FALSTAFF:
Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I
FALSTAFF:
will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.
FALSTAFF:
Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.
FALSTAFF:
Exeunt
FALSTAFF:
SCENE II. Windsor Park.
FALSTAFF:
Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER
PAGE:
Come, come, we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we
PAGE:
see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender,
PAGE:
my daughter.
SLENDER:
Ay, forsooth, I have spoke with her and we have a
SLENDER:
nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in
SLENDER:
white, and cry 'mum,' she cries 'budget,' and by
SLENDER:
that we know one another.
SHALLOW:
That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'
SHALLOW:
or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well
SHALLOW:
enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.
PAGE:
The night is dark, light and spirits will become it
PAGE:
well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil
PAGE:
but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.
PAGE:
Let's away, follow me.
PAGE:
Exeunt
PAGE:
SCENE III. A street leading to the Park.
PAGE:
Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS
MISTRESS PAGE:
Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you
MISTRESS PAGE:
see your time, take her by the band, away with her
MISTRESS PAGE:
to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before
MISTRESS PAGE:
into the Park: we two must go together.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
I know vat I have to do. Adieu.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Fare you well, sir.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Exit DOCTOR CAIUS
MISTRESS PAGE:
My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of
MISTRESS PAGE:
Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying
MISTRESS PAGE:
my daughter: but 'tis no matter, better a little
MISTRESS PAGE:
chiding than a great deal of heart-break.
MISTRESS FORD:
Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the
MISTRESS FORD:
Welsh devil Hugh?
MISTRESS PAGE:
They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,
MISTRESS PAGE:
with obscured lights, which, at the very instant of
MISTRESS PAGE:
Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once
MISTRESS PAGE:
display to the night.
MISTRESS FORD:
That cannot choose but amaze him.
MISTRESS PAGE:
If he be not amazed, he will be mocked, if he be
MISTRESS PAGE:
amazed, he will every way be mocked.
MISTRESS FORD:
We'll betray him finely.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Against such lewdsters and their lechery
MISTRESS PAGE:
Those that betray them do no treachery.
MISTRESS FORD:
The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!
MISTRESS FORD:
Exeunt
MISTRESS FORD:
SCENE IV. Windsor Park.
MISTRESS FORD:
Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised, with others as Fairies
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Trib, trib, fairies, come, and remember your parts
SIR HUGH EVANS:
be pold, I pray you, follow me into the pit, and
SIR HUGH EVANS:
when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid you
SIR HUGH EVANS:
come, come, trib, trib.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Exeunt
SIR HUGH EVANS:
SCENE V. Another part of the Park.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Enter FALSTAFF disguised as Herne
FALSTAFF:
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve, the minute
FALSTAFF:
draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!
FALSTAFF:
Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa, love
FALSTAFF:
set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some
FALSTAFF:
respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man
FALSTAFF:
a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love
FALSTAFF:
of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew
FALSTAFF:
to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in
FALSTAFF:
the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And
FALSTAFF:
then another fault in the semblance of a fowl, think
FALSTAFF:
on 't, Jove, a foul fault! When gods have hot
FALSTAFF:
backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
FALSTAFF:
Windsor stag, and the fattest, I think, i' the
FALSTAFF:
forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can
FALSTAFF:
blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my
FALSTAFF:
doe?
FALSTAFF:
Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE
MISTRESS FORD:
Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?
FALSTAFF:
My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
FALSTAFF:
potatoes, let it thunder to the tune of Green
FALSTAFF:
Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes, let
FALSTAFF:
there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.
MISTRESS FORD:
Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.
FALSTAFF:
Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will
FALSTAFF:
keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow
FALSTAFF:
of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.
FALSTAFF:
Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?
FALSTAFF:
Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience, he makes
FALSTAFF:
restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!
FALSTAFF:
Noise within
MISTRESS PAGE:
Alas, what noise?
MISTRESS FORD:
Heaven forgive our sins
FALSTAFF:
What should this be?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Away, away!
MISTRESS PAGE:
They run off
FALSTAFF:
I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the
FALSTAFF:
oil that's in me should set hell on fire, he would
FALSTAFF:
never else cross me thus.
FALSTAFF:
Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised as before, PISTOL,  as Hobgoblin, MISTRESS QUICKLY, ANNE PAGE, and others, as Fairies, with tapers
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
You moonshine revellers and shades of night,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Attend your office and your quality.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.
PISTOL:
Elves, list your names, silence, you airy toys.
PISTOL:
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap
PISTOL:
Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,
PISTOL:
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry
PISTOL:
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.
FALSTAFF:
They are fairies, he that speaks to them shall die
FALSTAFF:
I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.
FALSTAFF:
Lies down upon his face
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid
SIR HUGH EVANS:
That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Raise up the organs of her fantasy,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy
SIR HUGH EVANS:
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
About, about,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
The several chairs of order look you scour
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
With juice of balm and every precious flower
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Away, disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Our dance of custom round about the oak
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Pray you, lock hand in hand, yourselves in order set
SIR HUGH EVANS:
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
SIR HUGH EVANS:
To guide our measure round about the tree.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
But, stay, I smell a man of middle-earth.
FALSTAFF:
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
FALSTAFF:
transform me to a piece of cheese!
PISTOL:
Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
With trial-fire touch me his finger-end
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And turn him to no pain, but if he start,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.
PISTOL:
A trial, come.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Come, will this wood take fire?
SIR HUGH EVANS:
They burn him with their tapers
FALSTAFF:
Oh, Oh, Oh!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
About him, fairies, sing a scornful rhyme,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
SONG.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Fie on sinful fantasy!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Fie on lust and luxury!
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Lust is but a bloody fire,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Kindled with unchaste desire,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Pinch him, fairies, mutually,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Pinch him for his villany,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS  comes one way, and steals away a boy in green,  SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white,  and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.  A noise of hunting is heard within. All the  Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head, and rises
MISTRESS QUICKLY:
Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD
PAGE:
Nay, do not fly, I think we have watch'd you now
PAGE:
Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?
MISTRESS PAGE:
I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher
MISTRESS PAGE:
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
MISTRESS PAGE:
See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
MISTRESS PAGE:
Become the forest better than the town?
FORD:
Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
FORD:
Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave, here are his
FORD:
horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
FORD:
enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his
FORD:
cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be
FORD:
paid to Master Brook, his horses are arrested for
FORD:
it, Master Brook.
MISTRESS FORD:
Sir John, we have had ill luck, we could never meet.
MISTRESS FORD:
I will never take you for my love again, but I will
MISTRESS FORD:
always count you my deer.
FALSTAFF:
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
FORD:
Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.
FALSTAFF:
And these are not fairies? I was three or four
FALSTAFF:
times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
FALSTAFF:
the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
FALSTAFF:
powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
FALSTAFF:
received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
FALSTAFF:
rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
FALSTAFF:
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon
FALSTAFF:
ill employment!
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your
SIR HUGH EVANS:
desires, and fairies will not pinse you.
FORD:
Well said, fairy Hugh.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.
FORD:
I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
FORD:
able to woo her in good English.
FALSTAFF:
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that
FALSTAFF:
it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
FALSTAFF:
this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
FALSTAFF:
have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
FALSTAFF:
with a piece of toasted cheese.
SIR HUGH EVANS:
Seese is not good to give putter, your belly is all putter.
FALSTAFF:
'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
FALSTAFF:
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
FALSTAFF:
is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
FALSTAFF:
through the realm.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the
MISTRESS PAGE:
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
MISTRESS PAGE:
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
MISTRESS PAGE:
that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
FORD:
What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?
MISTRESS PAGE:
A puffed man?
PAGE:
Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?
FORD:
And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
PAGE:
And as poor as Job?
FORD:
And as wicked as his wife?
SIR HUGH EVANS:
And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack
SIR HUGH EVANS:
and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and
SIR HUGH EVANS:
swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
FALSTAFF:
Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me, I
FALSTAFF:
am dejected, I am not able to answer the Welsh
FALSTAFF:
flannel, ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use
FALSTAFF:
me as you will.
FORD:
Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one
FORD:
Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to
FORD:
whom you should have been a pander: over and above
FORD:
that you have suffered, I think to repay that money
FORD:
will be a biting affliction.
PAGE:
Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset
PAGE:
to-night at my house, where I will desire thee to
PAGE:
laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her
PAGE:
Master Slender hath married her daughter.
MISTRESS PAGE:
[Aside]  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my
MISTRESS PAGE:
daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Enter SLENDER
SLENDER:
Whoa ho! ho, father Page!
PAGE:
Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?
SLENDER:
Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire
SLENDER:
know on't, would I were hanged, la, else.
PAGE:
Of what, son?
SLENDER:
I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,
SLENDER:
and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been
SLENDER:
i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he
SLENDER:
should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
SLENDER:
been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis
SLENDER:
a postmaster's boy.
PAGE:
Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
SLENDER:
What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took
SLENDER:
a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for
SLENDER:
all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had
SLENDER:
him.
PAGE:
Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how
PAGE:
you should know my daughter by her garments?
SLENDER:
I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she
SLENDER:
cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed, and yet
SLENDER:
it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose,
MISTRESS PAGE:
turned my daughter into green, and, indeed, she is
MISTRESS PAGE:
now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Enter DOCTOR CAIUS
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'
DOCTOR CAIUS:
married un garcon, a boy, un paysan, by gar, a boy,
DOCTOR CAIUS:
it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Why, did you take her in green?
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.
DOCTOR CAIUS:
Exit
FORD:
This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?
PAGE:
My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.
PAGE:
Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE
PAGE:
How now, Master Fenton!
ANNE PAGE:
Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!
PAGE:
Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?
MISTRESS PAGE:
Why went you not with master doctor, maid?
FENTON:
You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
FENTON:
You would have married her most shamefully,
FENTON:
Where there was no proportion held in love.
FENTON:
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
FENTON:
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
FENTON:
The offence is holy that she hath committed,
FENTON:
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
FENTON:
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
FENTON:
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
FENTON:
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
FENTON:
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.
FORD:
Stand not amazed, here is no remedy
FORD:
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state,
FORD:
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.
FALSTAFF:
I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to
FALSTAFF:
strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.
PAGE:
Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
PAGE:
What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.
FALSTAFF:
When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.
MISTRESS PAGE:
Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Heaven give you many, many merry days!
MISTRESS PAGE:
Good husband, let us every one go home,
MISTRESS PAGE:
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire,
MISTRESS PAGE:
Sir John and all.
FORD:
Let it be so. Sir John,
FORD:
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
FORD:
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
FORD:
Exeunt
