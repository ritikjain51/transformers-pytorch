OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
ACT I
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants
AEGEON:
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
AEGEON:
And by the doom of death end woes and all.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more,
DUKE SOLINUS:
I am not partial to infringe our laws
DUKE SOLINUS:
The enmity and discord which of late
DUKE SOLINUS:
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
DUKE SOLINUS:
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
DUKE SOLINUS:
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
DUKE SOLINUS:
For, since the mortal and intestine jars
DUKE SOLINUS:
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
DUKE SOLINUS:
It hath in solemn synods been decreed
DUKE SOLINUS:
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
DUKE SOLINUS:
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
DUKE SOLINUS:
If any born at Ephesus be seen
DUKE SOLINUS:
At any Syracusian marts and fairs,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Again: if any Syracusian born
DUKE SOLINUS:
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
DUKE SOLINUS:
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Unless a thousand marks be levied,
DUKE SOLINUS:
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
AEGEON:
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
AEGEON:
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
DUKE SOLINUS:
Why thou departed'st from thy native home
DUKE SOLINUS:
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
AEGEON:
A heavier task could not have been imposed
AEGEON:
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable
AEGEON:
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
AEGEON:
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
AEGEON:
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
AEGEON:
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
AEGEON:
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
AEGEON:
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
AEGEON:
With her I lived in joy, our wealth increased
AEGEON:
By prosperous voyages I often made
AEGEON:
To Epidamnum, till my factor's death
AEGEON:
And the great care of goods at random left
AEGEON:
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
AEGEON:
From whom my absence was not six months old
AEGEON:
Before herself, almost at fainting under
AEGEON:
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
AEGEON:
Had made provision for her following me
AEGEON:
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
AEGEON:
There had she not been long, but she became
AEGEON:
A joyful mother of two goodly sons,
AEGEON:
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
AEGEON:
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
AEGEON:
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
AEGEON:
A meaner woman was delivered
AEGEON:
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike
AEGEON:
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
AEGEON:
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
AEGEON:
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
AEGEON:
Made daily motions for our home return
AEGEON:
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
AEGEON:
We came aboard.
AEGEON:
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
AEGEON:
Before the always wind-obeying deep
AEGEON:
Gave any tragic instance of our harm
AEGEON:
But longer did we not retain much hope,
AEGEON:
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
AEGEON:
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
AEGEON:
A doubtful warrant of immediate death,
AEGEON:
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
AEGEON:
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
AEGEON:
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
AEGEON:
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
AEGEON:
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
AEGEON:
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
AEGEON:
And this it was, for other means was none
AEGEON:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
AEGEON:
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us
AEGEON:
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
AEGEON:
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
AEGEON:
Such as seafaring men provide for storms,
AEGEON:
To him one of the other twins was bound,
AEGEON:
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other
AEGEON:
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
AEGEON:
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
AEGEON:
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast,
AEGEON:
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
AEGEON:
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
AEGEON:
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
AEGEON:
Dispersed those vapours that offended us,
AEGEON:
And by the benefit of his wished light,
AEGEON:
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
AEGEON:
Two ships from far making amain to us,
AEGEON:
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this
AEGEON:
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
AEGEON:
Gather the sequel by that went before.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,
DUKE SOLINUS:
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
AEGEON:
O, had the gods done so, I had not now
AEGEON:
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
AEGEON:
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
AEGEON:
We were encounterd by a mighty rock,
AEGEON:
Which being violently borne upon,
AEGEON:
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst,
AEGEON:
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
AEGEON:
Fortune had left to both of us alike
AEGEON:
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
AEGEON:
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
AEGEON:
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
AEGEON:
Was carried with more speed before the wind,
AEGEON:
And in our sight they three were taken up
AEGEON:
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
AEGEON:
At length, another ship had seized on us,
AEGEON:
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
AEGEON:
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests,
AEGEON:
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
AEGEON:
Had not their bark been very slow of sail,
AEGEON:
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
AEGEON:
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,
AEGEON:
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
AEGEON:
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
DUKE SOLINUS:
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Do me the favour to dilate at full
DUKE SOLINUS:
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
AEGEON:
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
AEGEON:
At eighteen years became inquisitive
AEGEON:
After his brother: and importuned me
AEGEON:
That his attendant--so his case was like,
AEGEON:
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
AEGEON:
Might bear him company in the quest of him
AEGEON:
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
AEGEON:
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
AEGEON:
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
AEGEON:
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
AEGEON:
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,
AEGEON:
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
AEGEON:
Or that or any place that harbours men.
AEGEON:
But here must end the story of my life,
AEGEON:
And happy were I in my timely death,
AEGEON:
Could all my travels warrant me they live.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
DUKE SOLINUS:
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
DUKE SOLINUS:
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
DUKE SOLINUS:
My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
DUKE SOLINUS:
But, though thou art adjudged to the death
DUKE SOLINUS:
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
DUKE SOLINUS:
But to our honour's great disparagement,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
DUKE SOLINUS:
To seek thy life by beneficial help
DUKE SOLINUS:
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
DUKE SOLINUS:
And live, if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
Gaoler:
I will, my lord.
AEGEON:
Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
AEGEON:
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
AEGEON:
Exeunt
AEGEON:
SCENE II. The Mart.
AEGEON:
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant
First Merchant:
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
First Merchant:
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
First Merchant:
This very day a Syracusian merchant
First Merchant:
Is apprehended for arrival here,
First Merchant:
And not being able to buy out his life
First Merchant:
According to the statute of the town,
First Merchant:
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
First Merchant:
There is your money that I had to keep.
First Merchant:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
OF SYRACUSE:
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
OF SYRACUSE:
Within this hour it will be dinner-time
OF SYRACUSE:
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
OF SYRACUSE:
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
OF SYRACUSE:
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
OF SYRACUSE:
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
OF SYRACUSE:
Get thee away.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Many a man would take you at your word,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Exit
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
OF SYRACUSE:
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
OF SYRACUSE:
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
OF SYRACUSE:
What, will you walk with me about the town,
OF SYRACUSE:
And then go to my inn and dine with me?
First Merchant:
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
First Merchant:
Of whom I hope to make much benefit,
First Merchant:
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
First Merchant:
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
First Merchant:
And afterward consort you till bed-time
First Merchant:
My present business calls me from you now.
First Merchant:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
OF SYRACUSE:
And wander up and down to view the city.
First Merchant:
Sir, I commend you to your own content.
First Merchant:
Exit
First Merchant:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
He that commends me to mine own content
OF SYRACUSE:
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
OF SYRACUSE:
I to the world am like a drop of water
OF SYRACUSE:
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
OF SYRACUSE:
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
OF SYRACUSE:
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself
OF SYRACUSE:
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
OF SYRACUSE:
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
OF SYRACUSE:
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
OF SYRACUSE:
Here comes the almanac of my true date.
OF SYRACUSE:
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
My mistress made it one upon my cheek
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
She is so hot because the meat is cold,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
The meat is cold because you come not home,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
You come not home because you have no stomach,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
You have no stomach having broke your fast,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Are penitent for your default to-day.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray
OF SYRACUSE:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
The saddler had it, sir, I kept it not.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I am not in a sportive humour now
OF SYRACUSE:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
OF SYRACUSE:
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
OF SYRACUSE:
So great a charge from thine own custody?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I from my mistress come to you in post,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And strike you home without a messenger.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season,
OF SYRACUSE:
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
OF SYRACUSE:
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
OF SYRACUSE:
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
My mistress and her sister stays for you.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
OF SYRACUSE:
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
OF SYRACUSE:
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed
OF SYRACUSE:
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
But not a thousand marks between you both.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
If I should pay your worship those again,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
OF SYRACUSE:
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Exit
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Upon my life, by some device or other
OF SYRACUSE:
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
OF SYRACUSE:
They say this town is full of cozenage,
OF SYRACUSE:
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
OF SYRACUSE:
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
OF SYRACUSE:
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
OF SYRACUSE:
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
OF SYRACUSE:
And many such-like liberties of sin
OF SYRACUSE:
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
OF SYRACUSE:
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave
OF SYRACUSE:
I greatly fear my money is not safe.
OF SYRACUSE:
Exit
OF SYRACUSE:
ACT II
OF SYRACUSE:
SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.
OF SYRACUSE:
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
ADRIANA:
Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
ADRIANA:
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
ADRIANA:
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
LUCIANA:
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
LUCIANA:
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
LUCIANA:
Good sister, let us dine and never fret
LUCIANA:
A man is master of his liberty
LUCIANA:
Time is their master, and, when they see time,
LUCIANA:
They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
ADRIANA:
Why should their liberty than ours be more?
LUCIANA:
Because their business still lies out o' door.
ADRIANA:
Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
LUCIANA:
O, know he is the bridle of your will.
ADRIANA:
There's none but asses will be bridled so.
LUCIANA:
Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
LUCIANA:
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
LUCIANA:
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky
LUCIANA:
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
LUCIANA:
Are their males' subjects and at their controls
LUCIANA:
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
LUCIANA:
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
LUCIANA:
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
LUCIANA:
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
LUCIANA:
Are masters to their females, and their lords
LUCIANA:
Then let your will attend on their accords.
ADRIANA:
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
LUCIANA:
Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
ADRIANA:
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
LUCIANA:
Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
ADRIANA:
How if your husband start some other where?
LUCIANA:
Till he come home again, I would forbear.
ADRIANA:
Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause,
ADRIANA:
They can be meek that have no other cause.
ADRIANA:
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
ADRIANA:
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry,
ADRIANA:
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
ADRIANA:
As much or more would we ourselves complain
ADRIANA:
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
ADRIANA:
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
ADRIANA:
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
ADRIANA:
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
LUCIANA:
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
LUCIANA:
Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.
LUCIANA:
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
ADRIANA:
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
can witness.
ADRIANA:
Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
LUCIANA:
Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
blows, and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
understand them.
ADRIANA:
But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
ADRIANA:
hath great care to please his wife.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
ADRIANA:
Horn-mad, thou villain!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I mean not cuckold-mad,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
But, sure, he is stark mad.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
When I desired him to come home to dinner,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I, 'My gold!' quoth he,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I, 'My gold!' quoth he
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
'Will you come home?' quoth I, 'My gold!' quoth he.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd,' 'My gold!' quoth he
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
'My mistress, sir' quoth I, 'Hang up thy mistress!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I know not thy mistress, out on thy mistress!'
LUCIANA:
Quoth who?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Quoth my master
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
ADRIANA:
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Go back again, and be new beaten home?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
For God's sake, send some other messenger.
ADRIANA:
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And he will bless that cross with other beating
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Between you I shall have a holy head.
ADRIANA:
Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Am I so round with you as you with me,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Exit
LUCIANA:
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!
ADRIANA:
His company must do his minions grace,
ADRIANA:
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
ADRIANA:
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
ADRIANA:
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it
ADRIANA:
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
ADRIANA:
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
ADRIANA:
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
ADRIANA:
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
ADRIANA:
That's not my fault: he's master of my state
ADRIANA:
What ruins are in me that can be found,
ADRIANA:
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
ADRIANA:
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
ADRIANA:
A sunny look of his would soon repair
ADRIANA:
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
ADRIANA:
And feeds from home, poor I am but his stale.
LUCIANA:
Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!
ADRIANA:
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
ADRIANA:
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
ADRIANA:
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
ADRIANA:
Sister, you know he promised me a chain,
ADRIANA:
Would that alone, alone he would detain,
ADRIANA:
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
ADRIANA:
I see the jewel best enamelled
ADRIANA:
Will lose his beauty, yet the gold bides still,
ADRIANA:
That others touch, and often touching will
ADRIANA:
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
ADRIANA:
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
ADRIANA:
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
ADRIANA:
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
LUCIANA:
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
LUCIANA:
Exeunt
LUCIANA:
SCENE II. A public place.
LUCIANA:
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
OF SYRACUSE:
Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
OF SYRACUSE:
Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
OF SYRACUSE:
By computation and mine host's report.
OF SYRACUSE:
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
OF SYRACUSE:
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
OF SYRACUSE:
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
OF SYRACUSE:
How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
OF SYRACUSE:
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
OF SYRACUSE:
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
OF SYRACUSE:
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
OF SYRACUSE:
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
OF SYRACUSE:
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I did not see you since you sent me hence,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
OF SYRACUSE:
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner,
OF SYRACUSE:
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I am glad to see you in this merry vein
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
OF SYRACUSE:
Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
OF SYRACUSE:
Beating him
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Upon what bargain do you give it me?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Because that I familiarly sometimes
OF SYRACUSE:
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
OF SYRACUSE:
Your sauciness will jest upon my love
OF SYRACUSE:
And make a common of my serious hours.
OF SYRACUSE:
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
OF SYRACUSE:
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
OF SYRACUSE:
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
OF SYRACUSE:
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
OF SYRACUSE:
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
it too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Dost thou not know?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Shall I tell you why?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Ay, sir, and wherefore, for they say every why hath
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
a wherefore.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Why, first,--for flouting me, and then, wherefore--
OF SYRACUSE:
For urging it the second time to me.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
nor reason?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, I thank you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Thank me, sir, for what?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
OF SYRACUSE:
something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, sir, I think the meat wants that I have.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
In good time, sir, what's that?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Basting.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Your reason?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
dry basting.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
OF SYRACUSE:
time for all things.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
By what rule, sir?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
pate of father Time himself.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Let's hear it.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
grows bald by nature.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
May he not do it by fine and recovery?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
lost hair of another man.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
OF SYRACUSE:
so plentiful an excrement?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
it in a kind of jollity.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
For what reason?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
For two, and sound ones too.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, not sound, I pray you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Sure ones, then.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Certain ones then.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Name them.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The one, to save the money that he spends in
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
trimming, the other, that at dinner they should not
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
drop in his porridge.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
You would all this time have proved there is no
OF SYRACUSE:
time for all things.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, and did, sir, namely, no time to recover hair
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
lost by nature.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
OF SYRACUSE:
time to recover.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
to the world's end will have bald followers.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion
OF SYRACUSE:
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?
OF SYRACUSE:
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
ADRIANA:
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown
ADRIANA:
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects,
ADRIANA:
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
ADRIANA:
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
ADRIANA:
That never words were music to thine ear,
ADRIANA:
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
ADRIANA:
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
ADRIANA:
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
ADRIANA:
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
ADRIANA:
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
ADRIANA:
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
ADRIANA:
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
ADRIANA:
That, undividable, incorporate,
ADRIANA:
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
ADRIANA:
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
ADRIANA:
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
ADRIANA:
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
ADRIANA:
And take unmingled that same drop again,
ADRIANA:
Without addition or diminishing,
ADRIANA:
As take from me thyself and not me too.
ADRIANA:
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
ADRIANA:
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
ADRIANA:
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
ADRIANA:
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
ADRIANA:
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
ADRIANA:
And hurl the name of husband in my face
ADRIANA:
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
ADRIANA:
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
ADRIANA:
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
ADRIANA:
I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.
ADRIANA:
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot,
ADRIANA:
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust
ADRIANA:
For if we too be one and thou play false,
ADRIANA:
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
ADRIANA:
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
ADRIANA:
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed,
ADRIANA:
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not
OF SYRACUSE:
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
OF SYRACUSE:
As strange unto your town as to your talk,
OF SYRACUSE:
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
OF SYRACUSE:
Want wit in all one word to understand.
LUCIANA:
Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
LUCIANA:
When were you wont to use my sister thus?
LUCIANA:
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
By Dromio?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
By me?
ADRIANA:
By thee, and this thou didst return from him,
ADRIANA:
That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
ADRIANA:
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
OF SYRACUSE:
What is the course and drift of your compact?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Villain, thou liest, for even her very words
OF SYRACUSE:
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I never spake with her in all my life.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
How can she thus then call us by our names,
OF SYRACUSE:
Unless it be by inspiration.
ADRIANA:
How ill agrees it with your gravity
ADRIANA:
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
ADRIANA:
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
ADRIANA:
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
ADRIANA:
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
ADRIANA:
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine
ADRIANA:
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
ADRIANA:
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
ADRIANA:
Makes me with thy strength to communicate
ADRIANA:
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
ADRIANA:
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss,
ADRIANA:
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
ADRIANA:
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
To me she speaks, she moves me for her theme
OF SYRACUSE:
What, was I married to her in my dream?
OF SYRACUSE:
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
OF SYRACUSE:
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
OF SYRACUSE:
Until I know this sure uncertainty,
OF SYRACUSE:
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
LUCIANA:
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
If we obey them not, this will ensue,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
LUCIANA:
Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
LUCIANA:
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I am transformed, master, am I not?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Thou hast thine own form.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, I am an ape.
LUCIANA:
If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
'Tis true, she rides me and I long for grass.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
'Tis so, I am an ass, else it could never be
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
But I should know her as well as she knows me.
ADRIANA:
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
ADRIANA:
To put the finger in the eye and weep,
ADRIANA:
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
ADRIANA:
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
ADRIANA:
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
ADRIANA:
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
ADRIANA:
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
ADRIANA:
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
ADRIANA:
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
OF SYRACUSE:
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
OF SYRACUSE:
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
OF SYRACUSE:
I'll say as they say and persever so,
OF SYRACUSE:
And in this mist at all adventures go.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
ADRIANA:
Ay, and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
LUCIANA:
Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
LUCIANA:
Exeunt
LUCIANA:
ACT III
LUCIANA:
SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.
LUCIANA:
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all,
OF EPHESUS:
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours
OF EPHESUS:
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
OF EPHESUS:
To see the making of her carcanet,
OF EPHESUS:
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
OF EPHESUS:
But here's a villain that would face me down
OF EPHESUS:
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
OF EPHESUS:
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
OF EPHESUS:
And that I did deny my wife and house.
OF EPHESUS:
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
I think thou art an ass.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Marry, so it doth appear
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I should kick, being kick'd, and, being at that pass,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
OF EPHESUS:
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
BALTHAZAR:
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
BALTHAZAR:
welcome dear.
BALTHAZAR:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
OF EPHESUS:
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.
BALTHAZAR:
Good meat, sir, is common, that every churl affords.
BALTHAZAR:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
And welcome more common, for that's nothing but words.
BALTHAZAR:
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
BALTHAZAR:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest
OF EPHESUS:
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part,
OF EPHESUS:
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
OF EPHESUS:
But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
idiot, patch!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
for such store,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
the street.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  Let him walk from whence he came, lest he
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
catch cold on's feet.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Who talks within there? ho, open the door!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  Right, sir, I'll tell you when, an you tell
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
me wherefore.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  Nor to-day here you must not, come again
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
when you may.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  The porter for this time, sir, and my name
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
is Dromio.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
name for an ass.
LUCE:
[Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those
LUCE:
at the gate?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Let my master in, Luce.
LUCE:
[Within]  Faith, no, he comes too late,
LUCE:
And so tell your master.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
O Lord, I must laugh!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?
LUCE:
[Within]  Have at you with another, that's--When?
LUCE:
can you tell?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
answered him well.
ANTIPHOLUS:
Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
ANTIPHOLUS:
OF EPHESUS
LUCE:
[Within]  I thought to have asked you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  And you said no.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Thou baggage, let me in.
LUCE:
[Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Master, knock the door hard.
LUCE:
[Within]  Let him knock till it ache.
LUCE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
LUCE:
[Within]  What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
ADRIANA:
[Within]  Who is that at the door that keeps all
ADRIANA:
this noise?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  By my troth, your town is troubled with
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
unruly boys.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Are you there, wife? you might have come before.
ADRIANA:
[Within]  Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.
ANGELO:
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
ANGELO:
fain have either.
BALTHAZAR:
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
They stand at the door, master, bid them welcome hither.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Your cake there is warm within, you stand here in the cold
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  Break any breaking here, and I'll break your
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
knave's pate.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
thee, hind!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
let me in.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
[Within]  Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Go get thee gone, fetch me an iron crow.
BALTHAZAR:
Have patience, sir, O, let it not be so!
BALTHAZAR:
Herein you war against your reputation
BALTHAZAR:
And draw within the compass of suspect
BALTHAZAR:
The unviolated honour of your wife.
BALTHAZAR:
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
BALTHAZAR:
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
BALTHAZAR:
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown
BALTHAZAR:
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
BALTHAZAR:
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
BALTHAZAR:
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
BALTHAZAR:
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
BALTHAZAR:
And about evening come yourself alone
BALTHAZAR:
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
BALTHAZAR:
If by strong hand you offer to break in
BALTHAZAR:
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
BALTHAZAR:
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
BALTHAZAR:
And that supposed by the common rout
BALTHAZAR:
Against your yet ungalled estimation
BALTHAZAR:
That may with foul intrusion enter in
BALTHAZAR:
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead,
BALTHAZAR:
For slander lives upon succession,
BALTHAZAR:
For ever housed where it gets possession.
BALTHAZAR:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
OF EPHESUS:
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
OF EPHESUS:
I know a wench of excellent discourse,
OF EPHESUS:
Pretty and witty, wild, and yet, too, gentle
OF EPHESUS:
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
OF EPHESUS:
My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
OF EPHESUS:
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal
OF EPHESUS:
To her will we to dinner.
OF EPHESUS:
To Angelo
OF EPHESUS:
Get you home
OF EPHESUS:
And fetch the chain, by this I know 'tis made
OF EPHESUS:
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,
OF EPHESUS:
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
OF EPHESUS:
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
OF EPHESUS:
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
OF EPHESUS:
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
OF EPHESUS:
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
ANGELO:
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
OF EPHESUS:
Exeunt
OF EPHESUS:
SCENE II. The same.
OF EPHESUS:
Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
LUCIANA:
And may it be that you have quite forgot
LUCIANA:
A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
LUCIANA:
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
LUCIANA:
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
LUCIANA:
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
LUCIANA:
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness
LUCIANA:
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth,
LUCIANA:
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness
LUCIANA:
Let not my sister read it in your eye,
LUCIANA:
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator,
LUCIANA:
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty,
LUCIANA:
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger,
LUCIANA:
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted,
LUCIANA:
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint,
LUCIANA:
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
LUCIANA:
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
LUCIANA:
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
LUCIANA:
And let her read it in thy looks at board
LUCIANA:
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed,
LUCIANA:
Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.
LUCIANA:
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
LUCIANA:
Being compact of credit, that you love us,
LUCIANA:
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve,
LUCIANA:
We in your motion turn and you may move us.
LUCIANA:
Then, gentle brother, get you in again,
LUCIANA:
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife
LUCIANA:
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
LUCIANA:
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
OF SYRACUSE:
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
OF SYRACUSE:
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
OF SYRACUSE:
Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
OF SYRACUSE:
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak,
OF SYRACUSE:
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
OF SYRACUSE:
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
OF SYRACUSE:
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
OF SYRACUSE:
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
OF SYRACUSE:
To make it wander in an unknown field?
OF SYRACUSE:
Are you a god? would you create me new?
OF SYRACUSE:
Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
OF SYRACUSE:
But if that I am I, then well I know
OF SYRACUSE:
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
OF SYRACUSE:
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
OF SYRACUSE:
Far more, far more to you do I decline.
OF SYRACUSE:
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
OF SYRACUSE:
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears
OF SYRACUSE:
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote
OF SYRACUSE:
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
OF SYRACUSE:
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
OF SYRACUSE:
And in that glorious supposition think
OF SYRACUSE:
He gains by death that hath such means to die
OF SYRACUSE:
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
LUCIANA:
What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Not mad, but mated, how, I do not know.
LUCIANA:
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
LUCIANA:
Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
LUCIANA:
Why call you me love? call my sister so.
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Thy sister's sister.
LUCIANA:
That's my sister.
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
No,
OF SYRACUSE:
It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
OF SYRACUSE:
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
OF SYRACUSE:
My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
OF SYRACUSE:
My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.
LUCIANA:
All this my sister is, or else should be.
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
OF SYRACUSE:
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life
OF SYRACUSE:
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
OF SYRACUSE:
Give me thy hand.
LUCIANA:
O, soft, air! hold you still
LUCIANA:
I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.
LUCIANA:
Exit
LUCIANA:
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
am I myself?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.
ANTIPHOLUS:
What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman, one
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
What claim lays she to thee?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
horse, and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
being a beast, she would have me, but that she,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
What is she?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A very reverent body, ay, such a one as a man may
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
wondrous fat marriage.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
What complexion is she of?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
clean kept: for why, she sweats, a man may go over
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
shoes in the grime of it.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
That's a fault that water will mend.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, sir, 'tis in grain, Noah's flood could not do it.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
What's her name?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nell, sir, but her name and three quarters, that's
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
hip to hip.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Then she bears some breadth?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
she is spherical, like a globe, I could find out
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
countries in her.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
In what part of her body stands Ireland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Where Scotland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I found it by the barrenness, hard in the palm of the hand.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Where France?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
In her forehead, armed and reverted, making war
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
against her heir.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Where England?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
whiteness in them, but I guess it stood in her chin,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Where Spain?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in her breath.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Where America, the Indies?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Dromio, swore I was assured to her, told me what
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
faith and my heart of steel,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
me turn i' the wheel.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Go hie thee presently, post to the road
OF SYRACUSE:
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
OF SYRACUSE:
I will not harbour in this town to-night
OF SYRACUSE:
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
OF SYRACUSE:
Where I will walk till thou return to me.
OF SYRACUSE:
If every one knows us and we know none,
OF SYRACUSE:
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
As from a bear a man would run for life,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
So fly I from her that would be my wife.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Exit
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
There's none but witches do inhabit here,
OF SYRACUSE:
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
OF SYRACUSE:
She that doth call me husband, even my soul
OF SYRACUSE:
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
OF SYRACUSE:
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
OF SYRACUSE:
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
OF SYRACUSE:
Hath almost made me traitor to myself
OF SYRACUSE:
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
OF SYRACUSE:
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
OF SYRACUSE:
Enter ANGELO with the chain
ANGELO:
Master Antipholus,--
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO:
I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
ANGELO:
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine
ANGELO:
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO:
What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO:
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANGELO:
Go home with it and please your wife withal,
ANGELO:
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
ANGELO:
And then receive my money for the chain.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
OF SYRACUSE:
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
ANGELO:
You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.
ANGELO:
Exit
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
What I should think of this, I cannot tell
OF SYRACUSE:
But this I think, there's no man is so vain
OF SYRACUSE:
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
OF SYRACUSE:
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
OF SYRACUSE:
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
OF SYRACUSE:
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay
OF SYRACUSE:
If any ship put out, then straight away.
OF SYRACUSE:
Exit
OF SYRACUSE:
ACT IV
OF SYRACUSE:
SCENE I. A public place.
OF SYRACUSE:
Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer
Second Merchant:
You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
Second Merchant:
And since I have not much importuned you,
Second Merchant:
Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
Second Merchant:
To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage
Second Merchant:
Therefore make present satisfaction,
Second Merchant:
Or I'll attach you by this officer.
ANGELO:
Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANGELO:
Is growing to me by Antipholus,
ANGELO:
And in the instant that I met with you
ANGELO:
He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
ANGELO:
I shall receive the money for the same.
ANGELO:
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
ANGELO:
I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
ANGELO:
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's
Officer:
That labour may you save: see where he comes.
Officer:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
OF EPHESUS:
And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
OF EPHESUS:
Among my wife and her confederates,
OF EPHESUS:
For locking me out of my doors by day.
OF EPHESUS:
But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone,
OF EPHESUS:
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Exit
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
A man is well holp up that trusts to you
OF EPHESUS:
I promised your presence and the chain,
OF EPHESUS:
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
OF EPHESUS:
Belike you thought our love would last too long,
OF EPHESUS:
If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
ANGELO:
Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANGELO:
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
ANGELO:
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
ANGELO:
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
ANGELO:
Than I stand debted to this gentleman
ANGELO:
I pray you, see him presently discharged,
ANGELO:
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
I am not furnish'd with the present money,
OF EPHESUS:
Besides, I have some business in the town.
OF EPHESUS:
Good signior, take the stranger to my house
OF EPHESUS:
And with you take the chain and bid my wife
OF EPHESUS:
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof
OF EPHESUS:
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
ANGELO:
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
No, bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO:
Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
An if I have not, sir, I hope you have,
OF EPHESUS:
Or else you may return without your money.
ANGELO:
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain
ANGELO:
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
ANGELO:
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
OF EPHESUS:
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
OF EPHESUS:
I should have chid you for not bringing it,
OF EPHESUS:
But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
Second Merchant:
The hour steals on, I pray you, sir, dispatch.
ANGELO:
You hear how he importunes me,--the chain!
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.
ANGELO:
Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANGELO:
Either send the chain or send me by some token.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
OF EPHESUS:
where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
Second Merchant:
My business cannot brook this dalliance.
Second Merchant:
Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no
Second Merchant:
If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
Second Merchant:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
I answer you! what should I answer you?
ANGELO:
The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO:
You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO:
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it
ANGELO:
Consider how it stands upon my credit.
Second Merchant:
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
Officer:
I do, and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.
ANGELO:
This touches me in reputation.
ANGELO:
Either consent to pay this sum for me
ANGELO:
Or I attach you by this officer.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Consent to pay thee that I never had!
OF EPHESUS:
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.
ANGELO:
Here is thy fee, arrest him, officer,
ANGELO:
I would not spare my brother in this case,
ANGELO:
If he should scorn me so apparently.
Officer:
I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
Officer:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
OF EPHESUS:
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
OF EPHESUS:
As all the metal in your shop will answer.
ANGELO:
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,
ANGELO:
To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
ANGELO:
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I have convey'd aboard, and I have bought
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The ship is in her trim, the merry wind
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
But for their owner, master, and yourself.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
OF EPHESUS:
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope,
OF EPHESUS:
And told thee to what purpose and what end.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
You sent me for a rope's end as soon
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
I will debate this matter at more leisure
OF EPHESUS:
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
OF EPHESUS:
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight
OF EPHESUS:
Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
OF EPHESUS:
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
OF EPHESUS:
There is a purse of ducats, let her send it
OF EPHESUS:
Tell her I am arrested in the street
OF EPHESUS:
And that shall bail me, hie thee, slave, be gone!
OF EPHESUS:
On, officer, to prison till it come.
OF EPHESUS:
Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and Antipholus of Ephesus
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
To Adriana! that is where we dined,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Thither I must, although against my will,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Exit
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
SCENE II. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
ADRIANA:
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
ADRIANA:
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
ADRIANA:
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
ADRIANA:
Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
ADRIANA:
What observation madest thou in this case
ADRIANA:
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
LUCIANA:
First he denied you had in him no right.
ADRIANA:
He meant he did me none, the more my spite.
LUCIANA:
Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
ADRIANA:
And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
LUCIANA:
Then pleaded I for you.
ADRIANA:
And what said he?
LUCIANA:
That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
ADRIANA:
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
LUCIANA:
With words that in an honest suit might move.
LUCIANA:
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
ADRIANA:
Didst speak him fair?
LUCIANA:
Have patience, I beseech.
ADRIANA:
I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still,
ADRIANA:
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
ADRIANA:
He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
ADRIANA:
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere,
ADRIANA:
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,
ADRIANA:
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
LUCIANA:
Who would be jealous then of such a one?
LUCIANA:
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
ADRIANA:
Ah, but I think him better than I say,
ADRIANA:
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
ADRIANA:
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away
ADRIANA:
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
ADRIANA:
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Here! go, the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.
LUCIANA:
How hast thou lost thy breath?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
By running fast.
ADRIANA:
Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
countermands
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.
ADRIANA:
Why, man, what is the matter?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.
ADRIANA:
What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
ADRIANA:
Go fetch it, sister.
ADRIANA:
Exit Luciana
ADRIANA:
This I wonder at,
ADRIANA:
That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
ADRIANA:
Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not on a band, but on a stronger thing,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?
ADRIANA:
What, the chain?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
strikes one.
ADRIANA:
The hours come back! that did I never hear.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
O, yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
very fear.
ADRIANA:
As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
worth, to season.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse
ADRIANA:
Go, Dromio, there's the money, bear it straight,
ADRIANA:
And bring thy master home immediately.
ADRIANA:
Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
ADRIANA:
Conceit, my comfort and my injury.
ADRIANA:
Exeunt
ADRIANA:
SCENE III. A public place.
ADRIANA:
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
OF SYRACUSE:
As if I were their well-acquainted friend,
OF SYRACUSE:
And every one doth call me by my name.
OF SYRACUSE:
Some tender money to me, some invite me,
OF SYRACUSE:
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,
OF SYRACUSE:
Some offer me commodities to buy
OF SYRACUSE:
Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
OF SYRACUSE:
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
OF SYRACUSE:
And therewithal took measure of my body.
OF SYRACUSE:
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
OF SYRACUSE:
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
OF SYRACUSE:
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
skin that was killed for the Prodigal, he that came
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
forsake your liberty.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I understand thee not.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
bass-viol, in a case of leather, the man, sir,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
and 'rests them, he, sir, that takes pity on decayed
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
men and gives them suits of durance, he that sets up
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
morris-pike.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
What, thou meanest an officer?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
any man to answer it that breaks his band, one that
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
give you good rest!'
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
bark Expedition put forth to-night, and then were
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
deliver you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
The fellow is distract, and so am I,
OF SYRACUSE:
And here we wander in illusions
OF SYRACUSE:
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
OF SYRACUSE:
Enter a Courtezan
Courtezan:
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
Courtezan:
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now
Courtezan:
Is that the chain you promised me to-day?
Courtezan:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, is this Mistress Satan?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
It is the devil.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam, and here
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
comes that the wenches say 'God damn me,' that's as
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
written, they appear to men like angels of light
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.
Courtezan:
Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
Courtezan:
Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat, or bespeak a
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
long spoon.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Why, Dromio?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
the devil.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
OF SYRACUSE:
Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress
OF SYRACUSE:
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
Courtezan:
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
Courtezan:
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
Courtezan:
And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
A nut, a cherry-stone,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.
Courtezan:
I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain
Courtezan:
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
Courtezan:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
Courtezan:
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
Courtezan:
Else would he never so demean himself.
Courtezan:
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
Courtezan:
And for the same he promised me a chain
Courtezan:
Both one and other he denies me now.
Courtezan:
The reason that I gather he is mad,
Courtezan:
Besides this present instance of his rage,
Courtezan:
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
Courtezan:
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Courtezan:
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
Courtezan:
On purpose shut the doors against his way.
Courtezan:
My way is now to hie home to his house,
Courtezan:
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
Courtezan:
He rush'd into my house and took perforce
Courtezan:
My ring away. This course I fittest choose,
Courtezan:
For forty ducats is too much to lose.
Courtezan:
Exit
Courtezan:
SCENE IV. A street.
Courtezan:
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer
Courtezan:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Fear me not, man, I will not break away
OF EPHESUS:
I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
OF EPHESUS:
To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
OF EPHESUS:
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
OF EPHESUS:
And will not lightly trust the messenger
OF EPHESUS:
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
OF EPHESUS:
I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
OF EPHESUS:
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end
OF EPHESUS:
Here comes my man, I think he brings the money.
OF EPHESUS:
How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
But where's the money?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
To a rope's-end, sir, and to that end am I returned.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
OF EPHESUS:
Beating him
Officer:
Good sir, be patient.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, 'tis for me to be patient, I am in adversity.
Officer:
Good, now, hold thy tongue.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
your blows.
ANTIPHOLUS:
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an
ANTIPHOLUS:
ass.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I am an ass, indeed, you may prove it by my long
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ears. I have served him from the hour of my
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
heats me with beating, when I am warm, he cools me
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
with beating, I am waked with it when I sleep,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
raised with it when I sit, driven out of doors with
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
it when I go from home, welcomed home with it when
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I return, nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
beggar wont her brat, and, I think when he hath
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Come, go along, my wife is coming yonder.
OF EPHESUS:
Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end, or
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
rope's-end.'
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Wilt thou still talk?
OF EPHESUS:
Beating him
Courtezan:
How say you now? is not your husband mad?
ADRIANA:
His incivility confirms no less.
ADRIANA:
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer,
ADRIANA:
Establish him in his true sense again,
ADRIANA:
And I will please you what you will demand.
LUCIANA:
Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
Courtezan:
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!
PINCH:
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
PINCH:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
OF EPHESUS:
Striking him
PINCH:
I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
PINCH:
To yield possession to my holy prayers
PINCH:
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight
PINCH:
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
PINCH:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ADRIANA:
O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
You minion, you, are these your customers?
OF EPHESUS:
Did this companion with the saffron face
OF EPHESUS:
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
OF EPHESUS:
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
OF EPHESUS:
And I denied to enter in my house?
ADRIANA:
O husband, God doth know you dined at home,
ADRIANA:
Where would you had remain'd until this time,
ADRIANA:
Free from these slanders and this open shame!
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
And did not she herself revile me there?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Certes, she did, the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
And did not I in rage depart from thence?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
In verity you did, my bones bear witness,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
ADRIANA:
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
PINCH:
It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
PINCH:
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
PINCH:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ADRIANA:
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
ADRIANA:
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
But surely master, not a rag of money.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
ADRIANA:
He came to me and I deliver'd it.
LUCIANA:
And I am witness with her that she did.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
God and the rope-maker bear me witness
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
PINCH:
Mistress, both man and master is possess'd,
PINCH:
I know it by their pale and deadly looks
PINCH:
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
PINCH:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
OF EPHESUS:
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
ADRIANA:
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And, gentle master, I received no gold,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
ADRIANA:
Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
OF EPHESUS:
And art confederate with a damned pack
OF EPHESUS:
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me
OF EPHESUS:
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
OF EPHESUS:
That would behold in me this shameful sport.
OF EPHESUS:
Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives
ADRIANA:
O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.
PINCH:
More company! The fiend is strong within him.
LUCIANA:
Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
LUCIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
OF EPHESUS:
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
OF EPHESUS:
To make a rescue?
Officer:
Masters, let him go
Officer:
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
PINCH:
Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
PINCH:
They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus
ADRIANA:
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
ADRIANA:
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
ADRIANA:
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
Officer:
He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
Officer:
The debt he owes will be required of me.
ADRIANA:
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee
ADRIANA:
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
ADRIANA:
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
ADRIANA:
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
ADRIANA:
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
O most unhappy strumpet!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
cry 'The devil!'
LUCIANA:
God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
ADRIANA:
Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
ADRIANA:
Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan
ADRIANA:
Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
Officer:
One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?
ADRIANA:
I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
Officer:
Two hundred ducats.
ADRIANA:
Say, how grows it due?
Officer:
Due for a chain your husband had of him.
ADRIANA:
He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
Courtezan:
When as your husband all in rage to-day
Courtezan:
Came to my house and took away my ring--
Courtezan:
The ring I saw upon his finger now--
Courtezan:
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
ADRIANA:
It may be so, but I did never see it.
ADRIANA:
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is
ADRIANA:
I long to know the truth hereof at large.
ADRIANA:
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and DROMIO of Syracuse
LUCIANA:
God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
ADRIANA:
And come with naked swords.
ADRIANA:
Let's call more help to have them bound again.
Officer:
Away! they'll kill us.
Officer:
Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
Officer:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I see these witches are afraid of swords.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
She that would be your wife now ran from you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Come to the Centaur, fetch our stuff from thence
OF SYRACUSE:
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Faith, stay here this night, they will surely do us
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
turn witch.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I will not stay to-night for all the town,
OF SYRACUSE:
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
OF SYRACUSE:
Exeunt
OF SYRACUSE:
ACT V
OF SYRACUSE:
SCENE I. A street before a Priory.
OF SYRACUSE:
Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO
ANGELO:
I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you,
ANGELO:
But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
ANGELO:
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
Second Merchant:
How is the man esteemed here in the city?
ANGELO:
Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO:
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
ANGELO:
Second to none that lives here in the city
ANGELO:
His word might bear my wealth at any time.
Second Merchant:
Speak softly, yonder, as I think, he walks.
Second Merchant:
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
ANGELO:
'Tis so, and that self chain about his neck
ANGELO:
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
ANGELO:
Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
ANGELO:
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
ANGELO:
That you would put me to this shame and trouble,
ANGELO:
And, not without some scandal to yourself,
ANGELO:
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
ANGELO:
This chain which now you wear so openly
ANGELO:
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
ANGELO:
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
ANGELO:
Who, but for staying on our controversy,
ANGELO:
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day
ANGELO:
This chain you had of me, can you deny it?
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I think I had, I never did deny it.
Second Merchant:
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
Second Merchant:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
Second Merchant:
These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.
Second Merchant:
Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest
Second Merchant:
To walk where any honest man resort.
Second Merchant:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus
OF SYRACUSE:
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
OF SYRACUSE:
Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.
Second Merchant:
I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
Second Merchant:
They draw
Second Merchant:
Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others
ADRIANA:
Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
ADRIANA:
Some get within him, take his sword away
ADRIANA:
Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Run, master, run, for God's sake, take a house!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA
AEMELIA:
Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
ADRIANA:
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
ADRIANA:
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
ADRIANA:
And bear him home for his recovery.
ANGELO:
I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
Second Merchant:
I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
AEMELIA:
How long hath this possession held the man?
ADRIANA:
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
ADRIANA:
And much different from the man he was,
ADRIANA:
But till this afternoon his passion
ADRIANA:
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
AEMELIA:
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
AEMELIA:
Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
AEMELIA:
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
AEMELIA:
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
AEMELIA:
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
AEMELIA:
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
ADRIANA:
To none of these, except it be the last,
ADRIANA:
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
AEMELIA:
You should for that have reprehended him.
ADRIANA:
Why, so I did.
AEMELIA:
Ay, but not rough enough.
ADRIANA:
As roughly as my modesty would let me.
AEMELIA:
Haply, in private.
ADRIANA:
And in assemblies too.
AEMELIA:
Ay, but not enough.
ADRIANA:
It was the copy of our conference
ADRIANA:
In bed he slept not for my urging it,
ADRIANA:
At board he fed not for my urging it,
ADRIANA:
Alone, it was the subject of my theme,
ADRIANA:
In company I often glanced it,
ADRIANA:
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
AEMELIA:
And thereof came it that the man was mad.
AEMELIA:
The venom clamours of a jealous woman
AEMELIA:
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
AEMELIA:
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
AEMELIA:
And therefore comes it that his head is light.
AEMELIA:
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings
AEMELIA:
Unquiet meals make ill digestions,
AEMELIA:
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,
AEMELIA:
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
AEMELIA:
Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls
AEMELIA:
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
AEMELIA:
But moody and dull melancholy,
AEMELIA:
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
AEMELIA:
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
AEMELIA:
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
AEMELIA:
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
AEMELIA:
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast
AEMELIA:
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
AEMELIA:
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
LUCIANA:
She never reprehended him but mildly,
LUCIANA:
When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
LUCIANA:
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?
ADRIANA:
She did betray me to my own reproof.
ADRIANA:
Good people enter and lay hold on him.
AEMELIA:
No, not a creature enters in my house.
ADRIANA:
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
AEMELIA:
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
AEMELIA:
And it shall privilege him from your hands
AEMELIA:
Till I have brought him to his wits again,
AEMELIA:
Or lose my labour in assaying it.
ADRIANA:
I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
ADRIANA:
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
ADRIANA:
And will have no attorney but myself,
ADRIANA:
And therefore let me have him home with me.
AEMELIA:
Be patient, for I will not let him stir
AEMELIA:
Till I have used the approved means I have,
AEMELIA:
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
AEMELIA:
To make of him a formal man again
AEMELIA:
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
AEMELIA:
A charitable duty of my order.
AEMELIA:
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
ADRIANA:
I will not hence and leave my husband here
ADRIANA:
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
ADRIANA:
To separate the husband and the wife.
AEMELIA:
Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.
AEMELIA:
Exit
LUCIANA:
Complain unto the duke of this indignity.
ADRIANA:
Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
ADRIANA:
And never rise until my tears and prayers
ADRIANA:
Have won his grace to come in person hither
ADRIANA:
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.
Second Merchant:
By this, I think, the dial points at five
Second Merchant:
Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person
Second Merchant:
Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
Second Merchant:
The place of death and sorry execution,
Second Merchant:
Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
ANGELO:
Upon what cause?
Second Merchant:
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
Second Merchant:
Who put unluckily into this bay
Second Merchant:
Against the laws and statutes of this town,
Second Merchant:
Beheaded publicly for his offence.
ANGELO:
See where they come: we will behold his death.
LUCIANA:
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.
LUCIANA:
Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended, AEGEON bareheaded, with the Headsman and other Officers
DUKE SOLINUS:
Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
DUKE SOLINUS:
If any friend will pay the sum for him,
DUKE SOLINUS:
He shall not die, so much we tender him.
ADRIANA:
Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!
DUKE SOLINUS:
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady
DUKE SOLINUS:
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
ADRIANA:
May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
ADRIANA:
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
ADRIANA:
At your important letters,--this ill day
ADRIANA:
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
ADRIANA:
That desperately he hurried through the street,
ADRIANA:
With him his bondman, all as mad as he--
ADRIANA:
Doing displeasure to the citizens
ADRIANA:
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
ADRIANA:
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
ADRIANA:
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
ADRIANA:
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
ADRIANA:
That here and there his fury had committed.
ADRIANA:
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
ADRIANA:
He broke from those that had the guard of him,
ADRIANA:
And with his mad attendant and himself,
ADRIANA:
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
ADRIANA:
Met us again and madly bent on us,
ADRIANA:
Chased us away, till, raising of more aid,
ADRIANA:
We came again to bind them. Then they fled
ADRIANA:
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them
ADRIANA:
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
ADRIANA:
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
ADRIANA:
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
ADRIANA:
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
ADRIANA:
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
DUKE SOLINUS:
And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
DUKE SOLINUS:
When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
DUKE SOLINUS:
To do him all the grace and good I could.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
DUKE SOLINUS:
And bid the lady abbess come to me.
DUKE SOLINUS:
I will determine this before I stir.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Enter a Servant
Servant:
O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
Servant:
My master and his man are both broke loose,
Servant:
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
Servant:
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire,
Servant:
And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
Servant:
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
Servant:
My master preaches patience to him and the while
Servant:
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
Servant:
And sure, unless you send some present help,
Servant:
Between them they will kill the conjurer.
ADRIANA:
Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
ADRIANA:
And that is false thou dost report to us.
Servant:
Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true,
Servant:
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
Servant:
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
Servant:
To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
Servant:
Cry within
Servant:
Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!
DUKE SOLINUS:
Come, stand by me, fear nothing. Guard with halberds!
ADRIANA:
Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
ADRIANA:
That he is borne about invisible
ADRIANA:
Even now we housed him in the abbey here,
ADRIANA:
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
ADRIANA:
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!
OF EPHESUS:
Even for the service that long since I did thee,
OF EPHESUS:
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
OF EPHESUS:
Deep scars to save thy life, even for the blood
OF EPHESUS:
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
AEGEON:
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
AEGEON:
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.
AEGEON:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
OF EPHESUS:
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
OF EPHESUS:
That hath abused and dishonour'd me
OF EPHESUS:
Even in the strength and height of injury!
OF EPHESUS:
Beyond imagination is the wrong
OF EPHESUS:
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
DUKE SOLINUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
OF EPHESUS:
While she with harlots feasted in my house.
DUKE SOLINUS:
A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?
ADRIANA:
No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
ADRIANA:
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
ADRIANA:
As this is false he burdens me withal!
LUCIANA:
Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
LUCIANA:
But she tells to your highness simple truth!
ANGELO:
O perjured woman! They are both forsworn
ANGELO:
In this the madman justly chargeth them.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
My liege, I am advised what I say,
OF EPHESUS:
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
OF EPHESUS:
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
OF EPHESUS:
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
OF EPHESUS:
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner
OF EPHESUS:
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
OF EPHESUS:
Could witness it, for he was with me then,
OF EPHESUS:
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
OF EPHESUS:
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
OF EPHESUS:
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
OF EPHESUS:
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
OF EPHESUS:
I went to seek him: in the street I met him
OF EPHESUS:
And in his company that gentleman.
OF EPHESUS:
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
OF EPHESUS:
That I this day of him received the chain,
OF EPHESUS:
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
OF EPHESUS:
He did arrest me with an officer.
OF EPHESUS:
I did obey, and sent my peasant home
OF EPHESUS:
For certain ducats: he with none return'd
OF EPHESUS:
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
OF EPHESUS:
To go in person with me to my house.
OF EPHESUS:
By the way we met
OF EPHESUS:
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
OF EPHESUS:
Of vile confederates. Along with them
OF EPHESUS:
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
OF EPHESUS:
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
OF EPHESUS:
A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
OF EPHESUS:
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
OF EPHESUS:
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
OF EPHESUS:
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
OF EPHESUS:
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
OF EPHESUS:
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
OF EPHESUS:
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
OF EPHESUS:
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
OF EPHESUS:
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
OF EPHESUS:
There left me and my man, both bound together,
OF EPHESUS:
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
OF EPHESUS:
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
OF EPHESUS:
Ran hither to your grace, whom I beseech
OF EPHESUS:
To give me ample satisfaction
OF EPHESUS:
For these deep shames and great indignities.
ANGELO:
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
ANGELO:
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.
DUKE SOLINUS:
But had he such a chain of thee or no?
ANGELO:
He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
ANGELO:
These people saw the chain about his neck.
Second Merchant:
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
Second Merchant:
Heard you confess you had the chain of him
Second Merchant:
After you first forswore it on the mart
Second Merchant:
And thereupon I drew my sword on you,
Second Merchant:
And then you fled into this abbey here,
Second Merchant:
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
Second Merchant:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
I never came within these abbey-walls,
OF EPHESUS:
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
OF EPHESUS:
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
OF EPHESUS:
And this is false you burden me withal.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
DUKE SOLINUS:
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
DUKE SOLINUS:
If here you housed him, here he would have been,
DUKE SOLINUS:
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly
DUKE SOLINUS:
You say he dined at home, the goldsmith here
DUKE SOLINUS:
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
Courtezan:
He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
Courtezan:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
'Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
Courtezan:
As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
DUKE SOLINUS:
I think you are all mated or stark mad.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Exit one to Abbess
AEGEON:
Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word
AEGEON:
Haply I see a friend will save my life
AEGEON:
And pay the sum that may deliver me.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
AEGEON:
Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
AEGEON:
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
AEGEON:
I am sure you both of you remember me.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
For lately we were bound, as you are now
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
AEGEON:
Why look you strange on me? you know me well.
ANTIPHOLUS:
I never saw you in my life till now.
AEGEON:
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
AEGEON:
And careful hours with time's deformed hand
AEGEON:
Have written strange defeatures in my face
AEGEON:
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
AEGEON:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Neither.
AEGEON:
Dromio, nor thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
No, trust me, sir, nor I.
AEGEON:
I am sure thou dost.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoever a
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
AEGEON:
Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
AEGEON:
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
AEGEON:
In seven short years, that here my only son
AEGEON:
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
AEGEON:
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
AEGEON:
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
AEGEON:
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
AEGEON:
Yet hath my night of life some memory,
AEGEON:
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
AEGEON:
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear
AEGEON:
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
AEGEON:
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
AEGEON:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
I never saw my father in my life.
AEGEON:
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
AEGEON:
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
AEGEON:
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
AEGEON:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
The duke and all that know me in the city
OF EPHESUS:
Can witness with me that it is not so
OF EPHESUS:
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.
DUKE SOLINUS:
I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
DUKE SOLINUS:
Have I been patron to Antipholus,
DUKE SOLINUS:
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa
DUKE SOLINUS:
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
AEMELIA:
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
AEMELIA:
All gather to see them
ADRIANA:
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
DUKE SOLINUS:
One of these men is Genius to the other,
DUKE SOLINUS:
And so of these. Which is the natural man,
DUKE SOLINUS:
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
I, sir, am Dromio, command him away.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I, sir, am Dromio, pray, let me stay.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
O, my old master! who hath bound him here?
AEMELIA:
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
AEMELIA:
And gain a husband by his liberty.
AEMELIA:
Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
AEMELIA:
That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
AEMELIA:
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons
AEMELIA:
O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
AEMELIA:
And speak unto the same AEmilia!
AEGEON:
If I dream not, thou art AEmilia
AEGEON:
If thou art she, tell me where is that son
AEGEON:
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
AEMELIA:
By men of Epidamnum he and I
AEMELIA:
And the twin Dromio all were taken up,
AEMELIA:
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
AEMELIA:
By force took Dromio and my son from them
AEMELIA:
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
AEMELIA:
What then became of them I cannot tell
AEMELIA:
I to this fortune that you see me in.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Why, here begins his morning story right,
DUKE SOLINUS:
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
DUKE SOLINUS:
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
DUKE SOLINUS:
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
DUKE SOLINUS:
These are the parents to these children,
DUKE SOLINUS:
Which accidentally are met together.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?
DUKE SOLINUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
No, sir, not I, I came from Syracuse.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Stay, stand apart, I know not which is which.
DUKE SOLINUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And I with him.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
OF EPHESUS:
Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.
ADRIANA:
Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I, gentle mistress.
ADRIANA:
And are not you my husband?
ADRIANA:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
No, I say nay to that.
OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
And so do I, yet did she call me so
OF SYRACUSE:
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
OF SYRACUSE:
Did call me brother.
OF SYRACUSE:
To Luciana
OF SYRACUSE:
What I told you then,
OF SYRACUSE:
I hope I shall have leisure to make good,
OF SYRACUSE:
If this be not a dream I see and hear.
ANGELO:
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANGELO:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
I think it be, sir, I deny it not.
OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO:
I think I did, sir, I deny it not.
ADRIANA:
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
ADRIANA:
By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
No, none by me.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
This purse of ducats I received from you,
OF SYRACUSE:
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
OF SYRACUSE:
I see we still did meet each other's man,
OF SYRACUSE:
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
OF SYRACUSE:
And thereupon these errors are arose.
OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
These ducats pawn I for my father here.
DUKE SOLINUS:
It shall not need, thy father hath his life.
Courtezan:
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
Courtezan:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
There, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer.
AEMELIA:
Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
AEMELIA:
To go with us into the abbey here
AEMELIA:
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes
AEMELIA:
And all that are assembled in this place,
AEMELIA:
That by this sympathized one day's error
AEMELIA:
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
AEMELIA:
And we shall make full satisfaction.
AEMELIA:
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
AEMELIA:
Of you, my sons, and till this present hour
AEMELIA:
My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
AEMELIA:
The duke, my husband and my children both,
AEMELIA:
And you the calendars of their nativity,
AEMELIA:
Go to a gossips' feast and go with me,
AEMELIA:
After so long grief, such festivity!
DUKE SOLINUS:
With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.
DUKE SOLINUS:
Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS:
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE:
He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio
OF SYRACUSE:
Come, go with us, we'll look to that anon
OF SYRACUSE:
Embrace thy brother there, rejoice with him.
OF SYRACUSE:
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
There is a fat friend at your master's house,
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
Not I, sir, you are my elder.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
That's a question: how shall we try it?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:
We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Nay, then, thus
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
We came into the world like brother and brother,
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Exeunt
