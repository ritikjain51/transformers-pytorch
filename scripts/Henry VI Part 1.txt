KING HENRY IV:
ACT I
KING HENRY IV:
SCENE I. Westminster Abbey.
KING HENRY IV:
Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the  Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of  France, GLOUCESTER, Protector, and EXETER, Earl of WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds,  and c
BEDFORD:
Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
BEDFORD:
Comets, importing change of times and states,
BEDFORD:
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
BEDFORD:
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
BEDFORD:
That have consented unto Henry's death!
BEDFORD:
King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
BEDFORD:
England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
GLOUCESTER:
England ne'er had a king until his time.
GLOUCESTER:
Virtue he had, deserving to command
GLOUCESTER:
His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams
GLOUCESTER:
His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings,
GLOUCESTER:
His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
GLOUCESTER:
More dazzled and drove back his enemies
GLOUCESTER:
Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
GLOUCESTER:
What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech
GLOUCESTER:
He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
EXETER:
We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
EXETER:
Henry is dead and never shall revive
EXETER:
Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
EXETER:
And death's dishonourable victory
EXETER:
We with our stately presence glorify,
EXETER:
Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
EXETER:
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
EXETER:
That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
EXETER:
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
EXETER:
Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him
EXETER:
By magic verses have contrived his end?
EXETER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
OF WINCHESTER:
Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day
OF WINCHESTER:
So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
OF WINCHESTER:
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought
OF WINCHESTER:
The church's prayers made him so prosperous.
GLOUCESTER:
The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,
GLOUCESTER:
His thread of life had not so soon decay'd
GLOUCESTER:
None do you like but an effeminate prince,
GLOUCESTER:
Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector
OF WINCHESTER:
And lookest to command the prince and realm.
OF WINCHESTER:
Thy wife is proud, she holdeth thee in awe,
OF WINCHESTER:
More than God or religious churchmen may.
GLOUCESTER:
Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,
GLOUCESTER:
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
GLOUCESTER:
Except it be to pray against thy foes.
BEDFORD:
Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace
BEDFORD:
Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us
BEDFORD:
Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms
BEDFORD:
Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.
BEDFORD:
Posterity, await for wretched years,
BEDFORD:
When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,
BEDFORD:
Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,
BEDFORD:
And none but women left to wail the dead.
BEDFORD:
Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate
BEDFORD:
Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,
BEDFORD:
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!
BEDFORD:
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
BEDFORD:
Than Julius Caesar or bright--
BEDFORD:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
My honourable lords, health to you all!
Messenger:
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
Messenger:
Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture
Messenger:
Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,
Messenger:
Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
BEDFORD:
What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
BEDFORD:
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
BEDFORD:
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
GLOUCESTER:
Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?
GLOUCESTER:
If Henry were recall'd to life again,
GLOUCESTER:
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
EXETER:
How were they lost? what treachery was used?
Messenger:
No treachery, but want of men and money.
Messenger:
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,
Messenger:
That here you maintain several factions,
Messenger:
And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
Messenger:
You are disputing of your generals
Messenger:
One would have lingering wars with little cost,
Messenger:
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings,
Messenger:
A third thinks, without expense at all,
Messenger:
By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
Messenger:
Awake, awake, English nobility!
Messenger:
Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot
Messenger:
Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms,
Messenger:
Of England's coat one half is cut away.
EXETER:
Were our tears wanting to this funeral,
EXETER:
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
BEDFORD:
Me they concern, Regent I am of France.
BEDFORD:
Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
BEDFORD:
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
BEDFORD:
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,
BEDFORD:
To weep their intermissive miseries.
BEDFORD:
Enter to them another Messenger
Messenger:
Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.
Messenger:
France is revolted from the English quite,
Messenger:
Except some petty towns of no import
Messenger:
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims,
Messenger:
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd,
Messenger:
Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part,
Messenger:
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.
EXETER:
The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
EXETER:
O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
GLOUCESTER:
We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.
GLOUCESTER:
Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.
BEDFORD:
Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
BEDFORD:
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,
BEDFORD:
Wherewith already France is overrun.
BEDFORD:
Enter another Messenger
Messenger:
My gracious lords, to add to your laments,
Messenger:
Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,
Messenger:
I must inform you of a dismal fight
Messenger:
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
Messenger:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?
Messenger:
O, no, wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown
Messenger:
The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
Messenger:
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,
Messenger:
Retiring from the siege of Orleans,
Messenger:
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
Messenger:
By three and twenty thousand of the French
Messenger:
Was round encompassed and set upon.
Messenger:
No leisure had he to enrank his men,
Messenger:
He wanted pikes to set before his archers,
Messenger:
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
Messenger:
They pitched in the ground confusedly,
Messenger:
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
Messenger:
More than three hours the fight continued,
Messenger:
Where valiant Talbot above human thought
Messenger:
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance
Messenger:
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him,
Messenger:
Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew
Messenger:
The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms,
Messenger:
All the whole army stood agazed on him
Messenger:
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
Messenger:
A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain
Messenger:
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
Messenger:
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,
Messenger:
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward
Messenger:
He, being in the vaward, placed behind
Messenger:
With purpose to relieve and follow them,
Messenger:
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
Messenger:
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre,
Messenger:
Enclosed were they with their enemies
Messenger:
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
Messenger:
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,
Messenger:
Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
Messenger:
Durst not presume to look once in the face.
BEDFORD:
Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,
BEDFORD:
For living idly here in pomp and ease,
BEDFORD:
Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
BEDFORD:
Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.
Messenger:
O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,
Messenger:
And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford
Messenger:
Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.
BEDFORD:
His ransom there is none but I shall pay
BEDFORD:
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne
BEDFORD:
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend,
BEDFORD:
Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
BEDFORD:
Farewell, my masters, to my task will I,
BEDFORD:
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,
BEDFORD:
To keep our great Saint George's feast withal
BEDFORD:
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
BEDFORD:
Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
Messenger:
So you had need, for Orleans is besieged,
Messenger:
The English army is grown weak and faint
Messenger:
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,
Messenger:
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
Messenger:
Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.
EXETER:
Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
EXETER:
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
EXETER:
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
BEDFORD:
I do remember it, and here take my leave,
BEDFORD:
To go about my preparation.
BEDFORD:
Exit
GLOUCESTER:
I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,
GLOUCESTER:
To view the artillery and munition,
GLOUCESTER:
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
EXETER:
To Eltham will I, where the young king is,
EXETER:
Being ordain'd his special governor,
EXETER:
And for his safety there I'll best devise.
EXETER:
Exit
EXETER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Each hath his place and function to attend
OF WINCHESTER:
I am left out, for me nothing remains.
OF WINCHESTER:
But long I will not be Jack out of office
OF WINCHESTER:
The king from Eltham I intend to steal
OF WINCHESTER:
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.
OF WINCHESTER:
Exeunt
OF WINCHESTER:
SCENE II. France. Before Orleans.
OF WINCHESTER:
Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, marching with drum and Soldiers
CHARLES:
Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens
CHARLES:
So in the earth, to this day is not known
CHARLES:
Late did he shine upon the English side,
CHARLES:
Now we are victors, upon us he smiles.
CHARLES:
What towns of any moment but we have?
CHARLES:
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans,
CHARLES:
Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,
CHARLES:
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
ALENCON:
They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves
ALENCON:
Either they must be dieted like mules
ALENCON:
And have their provender tied to their mouths
ALENCON:
Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
REIGNIER:
Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?
REIGNIER:
Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear
REIGNIER:
Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury,
REIGNIER:
And he may well in fretting spend his gall,
REIGNIER:
Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
CHARLES:
Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
CHARLES:
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
CHARLES:
Him I forgive my death that killeth me
CHARLES:
When he sees me go back one foot or fly.
CHARLES:
Exeunt
CHARLES:
Here alarum, they are beaten back by the English with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER
CHARLES:
Who ever saw the like? what men have I!
CHARLES:
Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,
CHARLES:
But that they left me 'midst my enemies.
REIGNIER:
Salisbury is a desperate homicide,
REIGNIER:
He fighteth as one weary of his life.
REIGNIER:
The other lords, like lions wanting food,
REIGNIER:
Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
ALENCON:
Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,
ALENCON:
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
ALENCON:
During the time Edward the Third did reign.
ALENCON:
More truly now may this be verified,
ALENCON:
For none but Samsons and Goliases
ALENCON:
It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
ALENCON:
Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose
ALENCON:
They had such courage and audacity?
CHARLES:
Let's leave this town, for they are hare-brain'd slaves,
CHARLES:
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager
CHARLES:
Of old I know them, rather with their teeth
CHARLES:
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
REIGNIER:
I think, by some odd gimmors or device
REIGNIER:
Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on,
REIGNIER:
Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
REIGNIER:
By my consent, we'll even let them alone.
ALENCON:
Be it so.
ALENCON:
Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
CHARLES:
Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
What's past and what's to come she can descry.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
For they are certain and unfallible.
CHARLES:
Go, call her in.
CHARLES:
Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS
CHARLES:
But first, to try her skill,
CHARLES:
Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place
CHARLES:
Question her proudly, let thy looks be stern
CHARLES:
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
CHARLES:
Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE
REIGNIER:
Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I know thee well, though never seen before.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
In private will I talk with thee apart.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
REIGNIER:
She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
To shine on my contemptible estate
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
God's mother deigned to appear to me
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And in a vision full of majesty
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Will'd me to leave my base vocation
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And free my country from calamity
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Her aid she promised and assured success
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
In complete glory she reveal'd herself,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And, whereas I was black and swart before,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
With those clear rays which she infused on me
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Ask me what question thou canst possible,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And I will answer unpremeditated
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
My courage try by combat, if thou darest,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
CHARLES:
Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms
CHARLES:
Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
CHARLES:
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,
CHARLES:
And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true,
CHARLES:
Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
churchyard,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
CHARLES:
Then come, o' God's name, I fear no woman.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes
CHARLES:
Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon
CHARLES:
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
CHARLES:
Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me
CHARLES:
Impatiently I burn with thy desire,
CHARLES:
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
CHARLES:
Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
CHARLES:
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be
CHARLES:
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I must not yield to any rites of love,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
For my profession's sacred from above
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Then will I think upon a recompense.
CHARLES:
Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
REIGNIER:
My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
ALENCON:
Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock,
ALENCON:
Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
REIGNIER:
Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
ALENCON:
He may mean more than we poor men do know
ALENCON:
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
REIGNIER:
My lord, where are you? what devise you on?
REIGNIER:
Shall we give over Orleans, or no?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Fight till the last gasp, I will be your guard.
CHARLES:
What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
This night the siege assuredly I'll raise
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Since I have entered into these wars.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Glory is like a circle in the water,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
With Henry's death the English circle ends,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Dispersed are the glories it included.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Now am I like that proud insulting ship
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.
CHARLES:
Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
CHARLES:
Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
CHARLES:
Helen, the mother of great Constantine,
CHARLES:
Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.
CHARLES:
Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,
CHARLES:
How may I reverently worship thee enough?
ALENCON:
Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
REIGNIER:
Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours,
REIGNIER:
Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.
CHARLES:
Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it
CHARLES:
No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.
CHARLES:
Exeunt
CHARLES:
SCENE III. London. Before the Tower.
CHARLES:
Enter GLOUCESTER, with his Serving-men in blue coats
GLOUCESTER:
I am come to survey the Tower this day
GLOUCESTER:
Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.
GLOUCESTER:
Where be these warders, that they wait not here?
GLOUCESTER:
Open the gates, 'tis Gloucester that calls.
First Warder:
[Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously?
First Warder:
First Serving-Man	It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.
Second Warder:
[Within]  Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.
Second Warder:
First Serving-Man	Villains, answer you so the lord protector?
First Warder:
[Within]  The Lord protect him! so we answer him
First Warder:
We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
GLOUCESTER:
Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?
GLOUCESTER:
There's none protector of the realm but I.
GLOUCESTER:
Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.
GLOUCESTER:
Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
GLOUCESTER:
Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within
WOODVILE:
What noise is this? what traitors have we here?
GLOUCESTER:
Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?
GLOUCESTER:
Open the gates, here's Gloucester that would enter.
WOODVILE:
Have patience, noble duke, I may not open,
WOODVILE:
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids
WOODVILE:
From him I have express commandment
WOODVILE:
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
GLOUCESTER:
Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?
GLOUCESTER:
Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,
GLOUCESTER:
Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?
GLOUCESTER:
Thou art no friend to God or to the king
GLOUCESTER:
Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.
GLOUCESTER:
Serving-Men	Open the gates unto the lord protector,
GLOUCESTER:
Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?
GLOUCESTER:
Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
I do, thou most usurping proditor,
OF WINCHESTER:
And not protector, of the king or realm.
GLOUCESTER:
Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,
GLOUCESTER:
Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord,
GLOUCESTER:
Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin
GLOUCESTER:
I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,
GLOUCESTER:
If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot
OF WINCHESTER:
This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,
OF WINCHESTER:
To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.
GLOUCESTER:
I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back
GLOUCESTER:
Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth
GLOUCESTER:
I'll use to carry thee out of this place.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Do what thou darest, I beard thee to thy face.
GLOUCESTER:
What! am I dared and bearded to my face?
GLOUCESTER:
Draw, men, for all this privileged place,
GLOUCESTER:
Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,
GLOUCESTER:
I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly
GLOUCESTER:
Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat
GLOUCESTER:
In spite of pope or dignities of church,
GLOUCESTER:
Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.
GLOUCESTER:
Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!
GLOUCESTER:
Now beat them hence, why do you let them stay?
GLOUCESTER:
Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.
GLOUCESTER:
Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!
GLOUCESTER:
Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER's men, and enter in the hurly- burly the Mayor of London and his Officers
Mayor:
Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,
Mayor:
Thus contumeliously should break the peace!
GLOUCESTER:
Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs
GLOUCESTER:
Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,
GLOUCESTER:
Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,
OF WINCHESTER:
One that still motions war and never peace,
OF WINCHESTER:
O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,
OF WINCHESTER:
That seeks to overthrow religion,
OF WINCHESTER:
Because he is protector of the realm,
OF WINCHESTER:
And would have armour here out of the Tower,
OF WINCHESTER:
To crown himself king and suppress the prince.
GLOUCESTER:
I will not answer thee with words, but blows.
GLOUCESTER:
Here they skirmish again
Mayor:
Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife
Mayor:
But to make open proclamation
Mayor:
Come, officer, as loud as e'er thou canst,
Mayor:
Cry.
Officer:
All manner of men assembled here in arms this day
Officer:
against God's peace and the king's, we charge and
Officer:
command you, in his highness' name, to repair to
Officer:
your several dwelling-places, and not to wear,
Officer:
handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,
Officer:
henceforward, upon pain of death.
GLOUCESTER:
Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law
GLOUCESTER:
But we shall meet, and break our minds at large.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, we will meet, to thy cost, be sure
OF WINCHESTER:
Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.
Mayor:
I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.
Mayor:
This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
GLOUCESTER:
Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head,
OF WINCHESTER:
For I intend to have it ere long.
OF WINCHESTER:
Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF WINCHESTER with their Serving-men
Mayor:
See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
Mayor:
Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!
Mayor:
I myself fight not once in forty year.
Mayor:
Exeunt
Mayor:
SCENE IV. Orleans.
Mayor:
Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy
Mayor:
Master-Gunner	Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,
Mayor:
And how the English have the suburbs won.
Boy:
Father, I know, and oft have shot at them,
Boy:
Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.
Boy:
Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me
Boy:
Chief master-gunner am I of this town,
Boy:
Something I must do to procure me grace.
Boy:
The prince's espials have informed me
Boy:
How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,
Boy:
Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
Boy:
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,
Boy:
And thence discover how with most advantage
Boy:
They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
Boy:
To intercept this inconvenience,
Boy:
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed,
Boy:
And even these three days have I watch'd,
Boy:
If I could see them.
Boy:
Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.
Boy:
If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word,
Boy:
And thou shalt find me at the governor's.
Boy:
Exit
Boy:
Father, I warrant you, take you no care,
Boy:
I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.
Boy:
Exit
Boy:
Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT, GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others
SALISBURY:
Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!
SALISBURY:
How wert thou handled being prisoner?
SALISBURY:
Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
SALISBURY:
Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
TALBOT:
The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
TALBOT:
Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles,
TALBOT:
For him was I exchanged and ransomed.
TALBOT:
But with a baser man of arms by far
TALBOT:
Once in contempt they would have barter'd me
TALBOT:
Which I, disdaining, scorn'd, and craved death,
TALBOT:
Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
TALBOT:
In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.
TALBOT:
But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,
TALBOT:
Whom with my bare fists I would execute,
TALBOT:
If I now had him brought into my power.
SALISBURY:
Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
TALBOT:
With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
TALBOT:
In open market-place produced they me,
TALBOT:
To be a public spectacle to all
TALBOT:
Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
TALBOT:
The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
TALBOT:
Then broke I from the officers that led me,
TALBOT:
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,
TALBOT:
To hurl at the beholders of my shame
TALBOT:
My grisly countenance made others fly,
TALBOT:
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
TALBOT:
In iron walls they deem'd me not secure,
TALBOT:
So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,
TALBOT:
That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,
TALBOT:
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant
TALBOT:
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,
TALBOT:
That walked about me every minute-while,
TALBOT:
And if I did but stir out of my bed,
TALBOT:
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
TALBOT:
Enter the Boy with a linstock
SALISBURY:
I grieve to hear what torments you endured,
SALISBURY:
But we will be revenged sufficiently
SALISBURY:
Now it is supper-time in Orleans
SALISBURY:
Here, through this grate, I count each one
SALISBURY:
and view the Frenchmen how they fortify
SALISBURY:
Let us look in, the sight will much delight thee.
SALISBURY:
Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,
SALISBURY:
Let me have your express opinions
SALISBURY:
Where is best place to make our battery next.
GARGRAVE:
I think, at the north gate, for there stand lords.
GLANSDALE:
And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.
TALBOT:
For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,
TALBOT:
Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
TALBOT:
Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall
SALISBURY:
O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!
GARGRAVE:
O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!
TALBOT:
What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
TALBOT:
Speak, Salisbury, at least, if thou canst speak
TALBOT:
How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?
TALBOT:
One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
TALBOT:
Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
TALBOT:
That hath contrived this woful tragedy!
TALBOT:
In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame,
TALBOT:
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars,
TALBOT:
Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,
TALBOT:
His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
TALBOT:
Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,
TALBOT:
One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace
TALBOT:
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
TALBOT:
Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
TALBOT:
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
TALBOT:
Bear hence his body, I will help to bury it.
TALBOT:
Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
TALBOT:
Speak unto Talbot, nay, look up to him.
TALBOT:
Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
TALBOT:
Thou shalt not die whiles--
TALBOT:
He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.
TALBOT:
As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
TALBOT:
Remember to avenge me on the French.'
TALBOT:
Plantagenet, I will, and like thee, Nero,
TALBOT:
Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn
TALBOT:
Wretched shall France be only in my name.
TALBOT:
Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens
TALBOT:
What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?
TALBOT:
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
TALBOT:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head
Messenger:
The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,
Messenger:
A holy prophetess new risen up,
Messenger:
Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
Messenger:
Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans
TALBOT:
Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!
TALBOT:
It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
TALBOT:
Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you
TALBOT:
Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,
TALBOT:
Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,
TALBOT:
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
TALBOT:
Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
TALBOT:
And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
TALBOT:
Alarum. Exeunt
TALBOT:
SCENE V. The same.
TALBOT:
Here an alarum again: and TALBOT pursueth the  DAUPHIN, and driveth him: then enter JOAN LA  PUCELLE, driving Englishmen before her, and exit after them then re-enter TALBOT
TALBOT:
Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?
TALBOT:
Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them
TALBOT:
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
TALBOT:
Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
TALBOT:
Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee,
TALBOT:
Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee
TALBOT:
Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,
TALBOT:
And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Here they fight
TALBOT:
Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?
TALBOT:
My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage
TALBOT:
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.
TALBOT:
But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.
TALBOT:
They fight again
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Talbot, farewell, thy hour is not yet come
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I must go victual Orleans forthwith.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
A short alarum, then enter the town with soldiers
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
O'ertake me, if thou canst, I scorn thy strength.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Help Salisbury to make his testament
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
This day is ours, as many more shall be.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Exit
TALBOT:
My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel,
TALBOT:
I know not where I am, nor what I do,
TALBOT:
A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
TALBOT:
Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists
TALBOT:
So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
TALBOT:
Are from their hives and houses driven away.
TALBOT:
They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs,
TALBOT:
Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.
TALBOT:
A short alarum
TALBOT:
Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,
TALBOT:
Or tear the lions out of England's coat,
TALBOT:
Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead
TALBOT:
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
TALBOT:
Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
TALBOT:
As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.
TALBOT:
Alarum. Here another skirmish
TALBOT:
It will not be: retire into your trenches
TALBOT:
You all consented unto Salisbury's death,
TALBOT:
For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
TALBOT:
Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,
TALBOT:
In spite of us or aught that we could do.
TALBOT:
O, would I were to die with Salisbury!
TALBOT:
The shame hereof will make me hide my head.
TALBOT:
Exit TALBOT. Alarum, retreat, flourish
TALBOT:
SCENE VI. The same.
TALBOT:
Enter, on the walls, JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, REIGNIER, ALENCON, and Soldiers
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Advance our waving colours on the walls,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Rescued is Orleans from the English
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.
CHARLES:
Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,
CHARLES:
How shall I honour thee for this success?
CHARLES:
Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens
CHARLES:
That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
CHARLES:
France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!
CHARLES:
Recover'd is the town of Orleans
CHARLES:
More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.
REIGNIER:
Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?
REIGNIER:
Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires
REIGNIER:
And feast and banquet in the open streets,
REIGNIER:
To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.
ALENCON:
All France will be replete with mirth and joy,
ALENCON:
When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.
CHARLES:
'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won,
CHARLES:
For which I will divide my crown with her,
CHARLES:
And all the priests and friars in my realm
CHARLES:
Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
CHARLES:
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
CHARLES:
Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was
CHARLES:
In memory of her when she is dead,
CHARLES:
Her ashes, in an urn more precious
CHARLES:
Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius,
CHARLES:
Transported shall be at high festivals
CHARLES:
Before the kings and queens of France.
CHARLES:
No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
CHARLES:
But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.
CHARLES:
Come in, and let us banquet royally,
CHARLES:
After this golden day of victory.
CHARLES:
Flourish. Exeunt
CHARLES:
ACT II
CHARLES:
SCENE I. Before Orleans.
CHARLES:
Enter a Sergeant of a band with two Sentinels
Sergeant:
Sirs, take your places and be vigilant
Sergeant:
If any noise or soldier you perceive
Sergeant:
Near to the walls, by some apparent sign
Sergeant:
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
First Sentinel:
Sergeant, you shall.
First Sentinel:
Exit Sergeant
First Sentinel:
Thus are poor servitors,
First Sentinel:
When others sleep upon their quiet beds,
First Sentinel:
Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold.
First Sentinel:
Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and Forces, with scaling-ladders, their drums beating a dead march
TALBOT:
Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,
TALBOT:
By whose approach the regions of Artois,
TALBOT:
Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,
TALBOT:
This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,
TALBOT:
Having all day caroused and banqueted
TALBOT:
Embrace we then this opportunity
TALBOT:
As fitting best to quittance their deceit
TALBOT:
Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.
BEDFORD:
Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,
BEDFORD:
Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,
BEDFORD:
To join with witches and the help of hell!
BURGUNDY:
Traitors have never other company.
BURGUNDY:
But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?
TALBOT:
A maid, they say.
BEDFORD:
A maid! and be so martial!
BURGUNDY:
Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,
BURGUNDY:
If underneath the standard of the French
BURGUNDY:
She carry armour as she hath begun.
TALBOT:
Well, let them practise and converse with spirits
TALBOT:
God is our fortress, in whose conquering name
TALBOT:
Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.
BEDFORD:
Ascend, brave Talbot, we will follow thee.
TALBOT:
Not all together: better far, I guess,
TALBOT:
That we do make our entrance several ways,
TALBOT:
That, if it chance the one of us do fail,
TALBOT:
The other yet may rise against their force.
BEDFORD:
Agreed: I'll to yond corner.
BURGUNDY:
And I to this.
TALBOT:
And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.
TALBOT:
Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right
TALBOT:
Of English Henry, shall this night appear
TALBOT:
How much in duty I am bound to both.
Sentinels:
Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!
Sentinels:
Cry: 'St. George,' 'A Talbot.'
Sentinels:
The French leap over the walls in their shirts.  Enter, several ways, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half unready
ALENCON:
How now, my lords! what, all unready so?
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
REIGNIER:
'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,
REIGNIER:
Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.
ALENCON:
Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,
ALENCON:
Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise
ALENCON:
More venturous or desperate than this.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
REIGNIER:
If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.
ALENCON:
Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE
CHARLES:
Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
CHARLES:
Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,
CHARLES:
Make us partakers of a little gain,
CHARLES:
That now our loss might be ten times so much?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
At all times will you have my power alike?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.
CHARLES:
Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
CHARLES:
That, being captain of the watch to-night,
CHARLES:
Did look no better to that weighty charge.
ALENCON:
Had all your quarters been as safely kept
ALENCON:
As that whereof I had the government,
ALENCON:
We had not been thus shamefully surprised.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Mine was secure.
REIGNIER:
And so was mine, my lord.
CHARLES:
And, for myself, most part of all this night,
CHARLES:
Within her quarter and mine own precinct
CHARLES:
I was employ'd in passing to and fro,
CHARLES:
About relieving of the sentinels
CHARLES:
Then how or which way should they first break in?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Question, my lords, no further of the case,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And now there rests no other shift but this,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And lay new platforms to endamage them.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A  Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their clothes behind
Soldier:
I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
Soldier:
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword,
Soldier:
For I have loaden me with many spoils,
Soldier:
Using no other weapon but his name.
Soldier:
Exit
Soldier:
SCENE II. Orleans. Within the town.
Soldier:
Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a Captain, and others
BEDFORD:
The day begins to break, and night is fled,
BEDFORD:
Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
BEDFORD:
Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.
BEDFORD:
Retreat sounded
TALBOT:
Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,
TALBOT:
And here advance it in the market-place,
TALBOT:
The middle centre of this cursed town.
TALBOT:
Now have I paid my vow unto his soul,
TALBOT:
For every drop of blood was drawn from him,
TALBOT:
There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.
TALBOT:
And that hereafter ages may behold
TALBOT:
What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,
TALBOT:
Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
TALBOT:
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd
TALBOT:
Upon the which, that every one may read,
TALBOT:
Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,
TALBOT:
The treacherous manner of his mournful death
TALBOT:
And what a terror he had been to France.
TALBOT:
But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
TALBOT:
I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,
TALBOT:
His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,
TALBOT:
Nor any of his false confederates.
BEDFORD:
'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,
BEDFORD:
Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
BEDFORD:
They did amongst the troops of armed men
BEDFORD:
Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.
BURGUNDY:
Myself, as far as I could well discern
BURGUNDY:
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,
BURGUNDY:
Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
BURGUNDY:
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
BURGUNDY:
Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
BURGUNDY:
That could not live asunder day or night.
BURGUNDY:
After that things are set in order here,
BURGUNDY:
We'll follow them with all the power we have.
BURGUNDY:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
All hail, my lords! which of this princely train
Messenger:
Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts
Messenger:
So much applauded through the realm of France?
TALBOT:
Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?
Messenger:
The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,
Messenger:
With modesty admiring thy renown,
Messenger:
By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe
Messenger:
To visit her poor castle where she lies,
Messenger:
That she may boast she hath beheld the man
Messenger:
Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
BURGUNDY:
Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars
BURGUNDY:
Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,
BURGUNDY:
When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.
BURGUNDY:
You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.
TALBOT:
Ne'er trust me then, for when a world of men
TALBOT:
Could not prevail with all their oratory,
TALBOT:
Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled
TALBOT:
And therefore tell her I return great thanks,
TALBOT:
And in submission will attend on her.
TALBOT:
Will not your honours bear me company?
BEDFORD:
No, truly, it is more than manners will
BEDFORD:
And I have heard it said, unbidden guests
BEDFORD:
Are often welcomest when they are gone.
TALBOT:
Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,
TALBOT:
I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.
TALBOT:
Come hither, captain.
TALBOT:
Whispers
TALBOT:
You perceive my mind?
Captain:
I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.
Captain:
Exeunt
Captain:
SCENE III. Auvergne. The COUNTESS's castle.
Captain:
Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter
Captain:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
Porter, remember what I gave in charge,
OF AUVERGNE:
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.
Porter:
Madam, I will.
Porter:
Exit
Porter:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,
OF AUVERGNE:
I shall as famous be by this exploit
OF AUVERGNE:
As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
OF AUVERGNE:
Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,
OF AUVERGNE:
And his achievements of no less account
OF AUVERGNE:
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,
OF AUVERGNE:
To give their censure of these rare reports.
OF AUVERGNE:
Enter Messenger and TALBOT
Messenger:
Madam,
Messenger:
According as your ladyship desired,
Messenger:
By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.
Messenger:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
And he is welcome. What! is this the man?
Messenger:
Madam, it is.
Messenger:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
Is this the scourge of France?
OF AUVERGNE:
Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
OF AUVERGNE:
That with his name the mothers still their babes?
OF AUVERGNE:
I see report is fabulous and false
OF AUVERGNE:
I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
OF AUVERGNE:
A second Hector, for his grim aspect,
OF AUVERGNE:
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
OF AUVERGNE:
Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
OF AUVERGNE:
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
OF AUVERGNE:
Should strike such terror to his enemies.
TALBOT:
Madam, I have been bold to trouble you,
TALBOT:
But since your ladyship is not at leisure,
TALBOT:
I'll sort some other time to visit you.
TALBOT:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.
Messenger:
Stay, my Lord Talbot, for my lady craves
Messenger:
To know the cause of your abrupt departure.
TALBOT:
Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,
TALBOT:
I go to certify her Talbot's here.
TALBOT:
Re-enter Porter with keys
TALBOT:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.
TALBOT:
Prisoner! to whom?
TALBOT:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
To me, blood-thirsty lord,
OF AUVERGNE:
And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
OF AUVERGNE:
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
OF AUVERGNE:
For in my gallery thy picture hangs
OF AUVERGNE:
But now the substance shall endure the like,
OF AUVERGNE:
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,
OF AUVERGNE:
That hast by tyranny these many years
OF AUVERGNE:
Wasted our country, slain our citizens
OF AUVERGNE:
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
TALBOT:
Ha, ha, ha!
TALBOT:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
TALBOT:
I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
TALBOT:
To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
TALBOT:
Whereon to practise your severity.
TALBOT:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
Why, art not thou the man?
TALBOT:
I am indeed.
TALBOT:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
Then have I substance too.
TALBOT:
No, no, I am but shadow of myself
TALBOT:
You are deceived, my substance is not here,
TALBOT:
For what you see is but the smallest part
TALBOT:
And least proportion of humanity
TALBOT:
I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
TALBOT:
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
TALBOT:
Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.
TALBOT:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
This is a riddling merchant for the nonce,
OF AUVERGNE:
He will be here, and yet he is not here
OF AUVERGNE:
How can these contrarieties agree?
TALBOT:
That will I show you presently.
TALBOT:
Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers
TALBOT:
How say you, madam? are you now persuaded
TALBOT:
That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
TALBOT:
These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,
TALBOT:
With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
TALBOT:
Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
TALBOT:
And in a moment makes them desolate.
TALBOT:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse
OF AUVERGNE:
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
OF AUVERGNE:
And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
OF AUVERGNE:
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,
OF AUVERGNE:
For I am sorry that with reverence
OF AUVERGNE:
I did not entertain thee as thou art.
TALBOT:
Be not dismay'd, fair lady, nor misconstrue
TALBOT:
The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake
TALBOT:
The outward composition of his body.
TALBOT:
What you have done hath not offended me,
TALBOT:
Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
TALBOT:
But only, with your patience, that we may
TALBOT:
Taste of your wine and see what cates you have,
TALBOT:
For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.
TALBOT:
COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE:
With all my heart, and think me honoured
OF AUVERGNE:
To feast so great a warrior in my house.
OF AUVERGNE:
Exeunt
OF AUVERGNE:
SCENE IV. London. The Temple-garden.
OF AUVERGNE:
Enter the Earls of SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another Lawyer
OF AUVERGNE:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?
PLANTAGENET:
Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
SUFFOLK:
Within the Temple-hall we were too loud,
SUFFOLK:
The garden here is more convenient.
SUFFOLK:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth,
PLANTAGENET:
Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?
SUFFOLK:
Faith, I have been a truant in the law,
SUFFOLK:
And never yet could frame my will to it,
SUFFOLK:
And therefore frame the law unto my will.
SOMERSET:
Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.
WARWICK:
Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch,
WARWICK:
Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,
WARWICK:
Between two blades, which bears the better temper
WARWICK:
Between two horses, which doth bear him best,
WARWICK:
Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye,
WARWICK:
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement,
WARWICK:
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
WARWICK:
Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
WARWICK:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance
PLANTAGENET:
The truth appears so naked on my side
PLANTAGENET:
That any purblind eye may find it out.
SOMERSET:
And on my side it is so well apparell'd,
SOMERSET:
So clear, so shining and so evident
SOMERSET:
That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
SOMERSET:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
PLANTAGENET:
In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
PLANTAGENET:
Let him that is a true-born gentleman
PLANTAGENET:
And stands upon the honour of his birth,
PLANTAGENET:
If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
PLANTAGENET:
From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
SOMERSET:
Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
SOMERSET:
But dare maintain the party of the truth,
SOMERSET:
Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
WARWICK:
I love no colours, and without all colour
WARWICK:
Of base insinuating flattery
WARWICK:
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
SUFFOLK:
I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
SUFFOLK:
And say withal I think he held the right.
VERNON:
Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,
VERNON:
Till you conclude that he upon whose side
VERNON:
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
VERNON:
Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
SOMERSET:
Good Master Vernon, it is well objected
SOMERSET:
If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.
SOMERSET:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
And I.
VERNON:
Then for the truth and plainness of the case.
VERNON:
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
VERNON:
Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
SOMERSET:
Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
SOMERSET:
Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
SOMERSET:
And fall on my side so, against your will.
VERNON:
If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,
VERNON:
Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
VERNON:
And keep me on the side where still I am.
SOMERSET:
Well, well, come on: who else?
Lawyer:
Unless my study and my books be false,
Lawyer:
The argument you held was wrong in you
Lawyer:
To SOMERSET
Lawyer:
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
Lawyer:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
SOMERSET:
Here in my scabbard, meditating that
SOMERSET:
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
SOMERSET:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses,
PLANTAGENET:
For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
PLANTAGENET:
The truth on our side.
SOMERSET:
No, Plantagenet,
SOMERSET:
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
SOMERSET:
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
SOMERSET:
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
SOMERSET:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
SOMERSET:
Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
SOMERSET:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,
PLANTAGENET:
Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
SOMERSET:
Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
SOMERSET:
That shall maintain what I have said is true,
SOMERSET:
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
SOMERSET:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
PLANTAGENET:
I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.
SUFFOLK:
Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.
SUFFOLK:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.
SUFFOLK:
I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
SOMERSET:
Away, away, good William de la Pole!
SOMERSET:
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
WARWICK:
Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset,
WARWICK:
His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,
WARWICK:
Third son to the third Edward King of England
WARWICK:
Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
WARWICK:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
He bears him on the place's privilege,
PLANTAGENET:
Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
SOMERSET:
By him that made me, I'll maintain my words
SOMERSET:
On any plot of ground in Christendom.
SOMERSET:
Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,
SOMERSET:
For treason executed in our late king's days?
SOMERSET:
And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,
SOMERSET:
Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
SOMERSET:
His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood,
SOMERSET:
And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.
SOMERSET:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
My father was attached, not attainted,
PLANTAGENET:
Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor,
PLANTAGENET:
And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
PLANTAGENET:
Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.
PLANTAGENET:
For your partaker Pole and you yourself,
PLANTAGENET:
I'll note you in my book of memory,
PLANTAGENET:
To scourge you for this apprehension
PLANTAGENET:
Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.
SOMERSET:
Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still,
SOMERSET:
And know us by these colours for thy foes,
SOMERSET:
For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
SOMERSET:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
PLANTAGENET:
As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
PLANTAGENET:
Will I for ever and my faction wear,
PLANTAGENET:
Until it wither with me to my grave
PLANTAGENET:
Or flourish to the height of my degree.
SUFFOLK:
Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!
SUFFOLK:
And so farewell until I meet thee next.
SUFFOLK:
Exit
SOMERSET:
Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.
SOMERSET:
Exit
SOMERSET:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
How I am braved and must perforce endure it!
WARWICK:
This blot that they object against your house
WARWICK:
Shall be wiped out in the next parliament
WARWICK:
Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester,
WARWICK:
And if thou be not then created York,
WARWICK:
I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
WARWICK:
Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,
WARWICK:
Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
WARWICK:
Will I upon thy party wear this rose
WARWICK:
And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
WARWICK:
Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,
WARWICK:
Shall send between the red rose and the white
WARWICK:
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
WARWICK:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,
PLANTAGENET:
That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.
VERNON:
In your behalf still will I wear the same.
Lawyer:
And so will I.
Lawyer:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Thanks, gentle sir.
PLANTAGENET:
Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say
PLANTAGENET:
This quarrel will drink blood another day.
PLANTAGENET:
Exeunt
PLANTAGENET:
SCENE V. The Tower of London.
PLANTAGENET:
Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers
MORTIMER:
Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
MORTIMER:
Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
MORTIMER:
Even like a man new haled from the rack,
MORTIMER:
So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.
MORTIMER:
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
MORTIMER:
Nestor-like aged in an age of care,
MORTIMER:
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
MORTIMER:
These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
MORTIMER:
Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent,
MORTIMER:
Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,
MORTIMER:
And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine
MORTIMER:
That droops his sapless branches to the ground,
MORTIMER:
Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
MORTIMER:
Unable to support this lump of clay,
MORTIMER:
Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
MORTIMER:
As witting I no other comfort have.
MORTIMER:
But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?
First Gaoler:
Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come
First Gaoler:
We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber,
First Gaoler:
And answer was return'd that he will come.
MORTIMER:
Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
MORTIMER:
Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
MORTIMER:
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
MORTIMER:
Before whose glory I was great in arms,
MORTIMER:
This loathsome sequestration have I had
MORTIMER:
And even since then hath Richard been obscured,
MORTIMER:
Deprived of honour and inheritance.
MORTIMER:
But now the arbitrator of despairs,
MORTIMER:
Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,
MORTIMER:
With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
MORTIMER:
I would his troubles likewise were expired,
MORTIMER:
That so he might recover what was lost.
MORTIMER:
Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET
First Gaoler:
My lord, your loving nephew now is come.
MORTIMER:
Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?
MORTIMER:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
PLANTAGENET:
Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.
MORTIMER:
Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
MORTIMER:
And in his bosom spend my latter gasp
MORTIMER:
O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
MORTIMER:
That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
MORTIMER:
And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
MORTIMER:
Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?
MORTIMER:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
First, lean thine aged back against mine arm,
PLANTAGENET:
And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
PLANTAGENET:
This day, in argument upon a case,
PLANTAGENET:
Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me,
PLANTAGENET:
Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
PLANTAGENET:
And did upbraid me with my father's death
PLANTAGENET:
Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
PLANTAGENET:
Else with the like I had requited him.
PLANTAGENET:
Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
PLANTAGENET:
In honour of a true Plantagenet
PLANTAGENET:
And for alliance sake, declare the cause
PLANTAGENET:
My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.
MORTIMER:
That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me
MORTIMER:
And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth
MORTIMER:
Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,
MORTIMER:
Was cursed instrument of his decease.
MORTIMER:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Discover more at large what cause that was,
PLANTAGENET:
For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
MORTIMER:
I will, if that my fading breath permit
MORTIMER:
And death approach not ere my tale be done.
MORTIMER:
Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
MORTIMER:
Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
MORTIMER:
The first-begotten and the lawful heir,
MORTIMER:
Of Edward king, the third of that descent
MORTIMER:
During whose reign the Percies of the north,
MORTIMER:
Finding his usurpation most unjust,
MORTIMER:
Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne
MORTIMER:
The reason moved these warlike lords to this
MORTIMER:
Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,
MORTIMER:
Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
MORTIMER:
I was the next by birth and parentage,
MORTIMER:
For by my mother I derived am
MORTIMER:
From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son
MORTIMER:
To King Edward the Third, whereas he
MORTIMER:
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
MORTIMER:
Being but fourth of that heroic line.
MORTIMER:
But mark: as in this haughty attempt
MORTIMER:
They laboured to plant the rightful heir,
MORTIMER:
I lost my liberty and they their lives.
MORTIMER:
Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,
MORTIMER:
Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
MORTIMER:
Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived
MORTIMER:
From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
MORTIMER:
Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
MORTIMER:
Again in pity of my hard distress
MORTIMER:
Levied an army, weening to redeem
MORTIMER:
And have install'd me in the diadem
MORTIMER:
But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl
MORTIMER:
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
MORTIMER:
In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.
MORTIMER:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
MORTIMER:
True, and thou seest that I no issue have
MORTIMER:
And that my fainting words do warrant death,
MORTIMER:
Thou art my heir, the rest I wish thee gather
MORTIMER:
But yet be wary in thy studious care.
MORTIMER:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Thy grave admonishments prevail with me
PLANTAGENET:
But yet, methinks, my father's execution
PLANTAGENET:
Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
MORTIMER:
With silence, nephew, be thou politic
MORTIMER:
Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,
MORTIMER:
And like a mountain, not to be removed.
MORTIMER:
But now thy uncle is removing hence
MORTIMER:
As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd
MORTIMER:
With long continuance in a settled place.
MORTIMER:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
O, uncle, would some part of my young years
PLANTAGENET:
Might but redeem the passage of your age!
MORTIMER:
Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth
MORTIMER:
Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
MORTIMER:
Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good,
MORTIMER:
Only give order for my funeral
MORTIMER:
And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes
MORTIMER:
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!
MORTIMER:
Dies
MORTIMER:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!
PLANTAGENET:
In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
PLANTAGENET:
And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
PLANTAGENET:
Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,
PLANTAGENET:
And what I do imagine let that rest.
PLANTAGENET:
Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself
PLANTAGENET:
Will see his burial better than his life.
PLANTAGENET:
Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER
PLANTAGENET:
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,
PLANTAGENET:
Choked with ambition of the meaner sort
PLANTAGENET:
And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,
PLANTAGENET:
Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house
PLANTAGENET:
I doubt not but with honour to redress,
PLANTAGENET:
And therefore haste I to the parliament,
PLANTAGENET:
Either to be restored to my blood,
PLANTAGENET:
Or make my ill the advantage of my good.
PLANTAGENET:
Exit
PLANTAGENET:
ACT III
PLANTAGENET:
SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.
PLANTAGENET:
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER,  WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK, the BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others.  GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill, BISHOP OF WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it
PLANTAGENET:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,
OF WINCHESTER:
With written pamphlets studiously devised,
OF WINCHESTER:
Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,
OF WINCHESTER:
Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
OF WINCHESTER:
Do it without invention, suddenly,
OF WINCHESTER:
As I with sudden and extemporal speech
OF WINCHESTER:
Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
GLOUCESTER:
Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,
GLOUCESTER:
Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.
GLOUCESTER:
Think not, although in writing I preferr'd
GLOUCESTER:
The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,
GLOUCESTER:
That therefore I have forged, or am not able
GLOUCESTER:
Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
GLOUCESTER:
No, prelate, such is thy audacious wickedness,
GLOUCESTER:
Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,
GLOUCESTER:
As very infants prattle of thy pride.
GLOUCESTER:
Thou art a most pernicious usurer,
GLOUCESTER:
Forward by nature, enemy to peace,
GLOUCESTER:
Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems
GLOUCESTER:
A man of thy profession and degree,
GLOUCESTER:
And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?
GLOUCESTER:
In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,
GLOUCESTER:
As well at London bridge as at the Tower.
GLOUCESTER:
Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,
GLOUCESTER:
The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
GLOUCESTER:
From envious malice of thy swelling heart.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe
OF WINCHESTER:
To give me hearing what I shall reply.
OF WINCHESTER:
If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,
OF WINCHESTER:
As he will have me, how am I so poor?
OF WINCHESTER:
Or how haps it I seek not to advance
OF WINCHESTER:
Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
OF WINCHESTER:
And for dissension, who preferreth peace
OF WINCHESTER:
More than I do?--except I be provoked.
OF WINCHESTER:
No, my good lords, it is not that offends,
OF WINCHESTER:
It is not that that hath incensed the duke
OF WINCHESTER:
It is, because no one should sway but he,
OF WINCHESTER:
No one but he should be about the king,
OF WINCHESTER:
And that engenders thunder in his breast
OF WINCHESTER:
And makes him roar these accusations forth.
OF WINCHESTER:
But he shall know I am as good--
GLOUCESTER:
As good!
GLOUCESTER:
Thou bastard of my grandfather!
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Ay, lordly sir, for what are you, I pray,
OF WINCHESTER:
But one imperious in another's throne?
GLOUCESTER:
Am I not protector, saucy priest?
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
And am not I a prelate of the church?
GLOUCESTER:
Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps
GLOUCESTER:
And useth it to patronage his theft.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Unreverent Gloster!
GLOUCESTER:
Thou art reverent
GLOUCESTER:
Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Rome shall remedy this.
WARWICK:
Roam thither, then.
SOMERSET:
My lord, it were your duty to forbear.
WARWICK:
Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.
SOMERSET:
Methinks my lord should be religious
SOMERSET:
And know the office that belongs to such.
WARWICK:
Methinks his lordship should be humbler,
WARWICK:
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
SOMERSET:
Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
WARWICK:
State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?
WARWICK:
Is not his grace protector to the king?
WARWICK:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
[Aside]  Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,
PLANTAGENET:
Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should,
PLANTAGENET:
Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'
PLANTAGENET:
Else would I have a fling at Winchester.
KING HENRY VI:
Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,
KING HENRY VI:
The special watchmen of our English weal,
KING HENRY VI:
I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,
KING HENRY VI:
To join your hearts in love and amity.
KING HENRY VI:
O, what a scandal is it to our crown,
KING HENRY VI:
That two such noble peers as ye should jar!
KING HENRY VI:
Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell
KING HENRY VI:
Civil dissension is a viperous worm
KING HENRY VI:
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
KING HENRY VI:
A noise within, 'Down with the tawny-coats!'
KING HENRY VI:
What tumult's this?
WARWICK:
An uproar, I dare warrant,
WARWICK:
Begun through malice of the bishop's men.
WARWICK:
A noise again, 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor
Mayor:
O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
Mayor:
Pity the city of London, pity us!
Mayor:
The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,
Mayor:
Forbidden late to carry any weapon,
Mayor:
Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
Mayor:
And banding themselves in contrary parts
Mayor:
Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
Mayor:
That many have their giddy brains knock'd out
Mayor:
Our windows are broke down in every street
Mayor:
And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
Mayor:
Enter Serving-men, in skirmish, with bloody pates
KING HENRY VI:
We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,
KING HENRY VI:
To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.
KING HENRY VI:
Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.
KING HENRY VI:
First Serving-man	Nay, if we be forbidden stones,
KING HENRY VI:
We'll fall to it with our teeth.
KING HENRY VI:
Second Serving-man	Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.
KING HENRY VI:
Skirmish again
GLOUCESTER:
You of my household, leave this peevish broil
GLOUCESTER:
And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.
GLOUCESTER:
Third Serving-man	My lord, we know your grace to be a man
GLOUCESTER:
Just and upright, and, for your royal birth,
GLOUCESTER:
Inferior to none but to his majesty
GLOUCESTER:
And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
GLOUCESTER:
So kind a father of the commonweal,
GLOUCESTER:
To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,
GLOUCESTER:
We and our wives and children all will fight
GLOUCESTER:
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.
GLOUCESTER:
First Serving-man	Ay, and the very parings of our nails
GLOUCESTER:
Shall pitch a field when we are dead.
GLOUCESTER:
Begin again
GLOUCESTER:
Stay, stay, I say!
GLOUCESTER:
And if you love me, as you say you do,
GLOUCESTER:
Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.
KING HENRY VI:
O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!
KING HENRY VI:
Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold
KING HENRY VI:
My sighs and tears and will not once relent?
KING HENRY VI:
Who should be pitiful, if you be not?
KING HENRY VI:
Or who should study to prefer a peace.
KING HENRY VI:
If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
WARWICK:
Yield, my lord protector, yield, Winchester,
WARWICK:
Except you mean with obstinate repulse
WARWICK:
To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
WARWICK:
You see what mischief and what murder too
WARWICK:
Hath been enacted through your enmity,
WARWICK:
Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.
WARWICK:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
He shall submit, or I will never yield.
GLOUCESTER:
Compassion on the king commands me stoop,
GLOUCESTER:
Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest
GLOUCESTER:
Should ever get that privilege of me.
WARWICK:
Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke
WARWICK:
Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,
WARWICK:
As by his smoothed brows it doth appear
WARWICK:
Why look you still so stern and tragical?
GLOUCESTER:
Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.
KING HENRY VI:
Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
KING HENRY VI:
That malice was a great and grievous sin,
KING HENRY VI:
And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
KING HENRY VI:
But prove a chief offender in the same?
WARWICK:
Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.
WARWICK:
For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!
WARWICK:
What, shall a child instruct you what to do?
WARWICK:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee,
OF WINCHESTER:
Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside]  Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.--
GLOUCESTER:
See here, my friends and loving countrymen,
GLOUCESTER:
This token serveth for a flag of truce
GLOUCESTER:
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers
GLOUCESTER:
So help me God, as I dissemble not!
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
[Aside]  So help me God, as I intend it not!
KING HENRY VI:
O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,
KING HENRY VI:
How joyful am I made by this contract!
KING HENRY VI:
Away, my masters! trouble us no more,
KING HENRY VI:
But join in friendship, as your lords have done.
KING HENRY VI:
First Serving-man	Content: I'll to the surgeon's.
KING HENRY VI:
Second Serving-man	And so will I.
KING HENRY VI:
Third Serving-man	And I will see what physic the tavern affords.
KING HENRY VI:
Exeunt Serving-men, Mayor,  and c
WARWICK:
Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,
WARWICK:
Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
WARWICK:
We do exhibit to your majesty.
GLOUCESTER:
Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,
GLOUCESTER:
And if your grace mark every circumstance,
GLOUCESTER:
You have great reason to do Richard right,
GLOUCESTER:
Especially for those occasions
GLOUCESTER:
At Eltham Place I told your majesty.
KING HENRY VI:
And those occasions, uncle, were of force
KING HENRY VI:
Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is
KING HENRY VI:
That Richard be restored to his blood.
WARWICK:
Let Richard be restored to his blood,
WARWICK:
So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.
WARWICK:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.
KING HENRY VI:
If Richard will be true, not that alone
KING HENRY VI:
But all the whole inheritance I give
KING HENRY VI:
That doth belong unto the house of York,
KING HENRY VI:
From whence you spring by lineal descent.
KING HENRY VI:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
Thy humble servant vows obedience
PLANTAGENET:
And humble service till the point of death.
KING HENRY VI:
Stoop then and set your knee against my foot,
KING HENRY VI:
And, in reguerdon of that duty done,
KING HENRY VI:
I gird thee with the valiant sword of York
KING HENRY VI:
Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,
KING HENRY VI:
And rise created princely Duke of York.
KING HENRY VI:
RICHARD
PLANTAGENET:
And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
PLANTAGENET:
And as my duty springs, so perish they
PLANTAGENET:
That grudge one thought against your majesty!
ALL:
Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!
SOMERSET:
[Aside]  Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!
GLOUCESTER:
Now will it best avail your majesty
GLOUCESTER:
To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France
GLOUCESTER:
The presence of a king engenders love
GLOUCESTER:
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
GLOUCESTER:
As it disanimates his enemies.
KING HENRY VI:
When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes,
KING HENRY VI:
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
GLOUCESTER:
Your ships already are in readiness.
GLOUCESTER:
Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER
EXETER:
Ay, we may march in England or in France,
EXETER:
Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
EXETER:
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
EXETER:
Burns under feigned ashes of forged love
EXETER:
And will at last break out into a flame
EXETER:
As fester'd members rot but by degree,
EXETER:
Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,
EXETER:
So will this base and envious discord breed.
EXETER:
And now I fear that fatal prophecy
EXETER:
Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
EXETER:
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe,
EXETER:
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
EXETER:
And Henry born at Windsor lose all
EXETER:
Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
EXETER:
His days may finish ere that hapless time.
EXETER:
Exit
EXETER:
SCENE II. France. Before Rouen.
EXETER:
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE disguised, with four Soldiers with sacks upon their backs
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Through which our policy must make a breach
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Take heed, be wary how you place your words,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
That come to gather money for their corn.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
First Soldier:
Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,
First Soldier:
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen,
First Soldier:
Therefore we'll knock.
First Soldier:
Knocks
Watch:
[Within]  Qui est la?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Paysans, pauvres gens de France,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.
Watch:
Enter, go in, the market bell is rung.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Exeunt
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, REIGNIER, and forces
CHARLES:
Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!
CHARLES:
And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants,
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Now she is there, how will she specify
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Where is the best and safest passage in?
REIGNIER:
By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower,
REIGNIER:
Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,
REIGNIER:
No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd.
REIGNIER:
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top, thrusting out a torch burning
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Behold, this is the happy wedding torch
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
But burning fatal to the Talbotites!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Exit
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend,
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
CHARLES:
Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
CHARLES:
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
REIGNIER:
Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends,
REIGNIER:
Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
REIGNIER:
And then do execution on the watch.
REIGNIER:
Alarum. Exeunt
REIGNIER:
An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion
TALBOT:
France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
TALBOT:
If Talbot but survive thy treachery.
TALBOT:
Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,
TALBOT:
Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,
TALBOT:
That hardly we escaped the pride of France.
TALBOT:
Exit
TALBOT:
An alarum: excursions. BEDFORD, brought in sick  in a chair. Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without:  within JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, on the walls
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Before he'll buy again at such a rate
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
'Twas full of darnel, do you like the taste?
BURGUNDY:
Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!
BURGUNDY:
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
BURGUNDY:
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.
CHARLES:
Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.
BEDFORD:
O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And run a tilt at death within a chair?
TALBOT:
Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,
TALBOT:
Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!
TALBOT:
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
TALBOT:
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
TALBOT:
Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
TALBOT:
Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Are ye so hot, sir? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
The English whisper together in council
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?
TALBOT:
Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
To try if that our own be ours or no.
TALBOT:
I speak not to that railing Hecate,
TALBOT:
But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest,
TALBOT:
Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?
ALENCON:
Signior, no.
TALBOT:
Signior, hang! base muleters of France!
TALBOT:
Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
TALBOT:
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Away, captains! let's get us from the walls,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
That we are here.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Exeunt from the walls
TALBOT:
And there will we be too, ere it be long,
TALBOT:
Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!
TALBOT:
Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,
TALBOT:
Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,
TALBOT:
Either to get the town again or die
TALBOT:
And I, as sure as English Henry lives
TALBOT:
And as his father here was conqueror,
TALBOT:
As sure as in this late-betrayed town
TALBOT:
Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,
TALBOT:
So sure I swear to get the town or die.
BURGUNDY:
My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
TALBOT:
But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,
TALBOT:
The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,
TALBOT:
We will bestow you in some better place,
TALBOT:
Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.
BEDFORD:
Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me
BEDFORD:
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen
BEDFORD:
And will be partner of your weal or woe.
BURGUNDY:
Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.
BEDFORD:
Not to be gone from hence, for once I read
BEDFORD:
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
BEDFORD:
Came to the field and vanquished his foes
BEDFORD:
Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,
BEDFORD:
Because I ever found them as myself.
TALBOT:
Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
TALBOT:
Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!
TALBOT:
And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
TALBOT:
But gather we our forces out of hand
TALBOT:
And set upon our boasting enemy.
TALBOT:
Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants
TALBOT:
An alarum: excursions. Enter FASTOLFE and a Captain
Captain:
Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?
FASTOLFE:
Whither away! to save myself by flight
FASTOLFE:
We are like to have the overthrow again.
Captain:
What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?
FASTOLFE:
Ay,
FASTOLFE:
All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!
FASTOLFE:
Exit
Captain:
Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!
Captain:
Exit
Captain:
Retreat: excursions. JOAN LA PUCELLE, ALENCON, and CHARLES fly
BEDFORD:
Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
BEDFORD:
For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.
BEDFORD:
What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
BEDFORD:
They that of late were daring with their scoffs
BEDFORD:
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
BEDFORD:
BEDFORD dies, and is carried in by two in his chair
BEDFORD:
An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest
TALBOT:
Lost, and recover'd in a day again!
TALBOT:
This is a double honour, Burgundy
TALBOT:
Yet heavens have glory for this victory!
BURGUNDY:
Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
BURGUNDY:
Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
BURGUNDY:
Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.
TALBOT:
Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?
TALBOT:
I think her old familiar is asleep
TALBOT:
Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?
TALBOT:
What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief
TALBOT:
That such a valiant company are fled.
TALBOT:
Now will we take some order in the town,
TALBOT:
Placing therein some expert officers,
TALBOT:
And then depart to Paris to the king,
TALBOT:
For there young Henry with his nobles lie.
BURGUNDY:
What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
TALBOT:
But yet, before we go, let's not forget
TALBOT:
The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,
TALBOT:
But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen
TALBOT:
A braver soldier never couched lance,
TALBOT:
A gentler heart did never sway in court,
TALBOT:
But kings and mightiest potentates must die,
TALBOT:
For that's the end of human misery.
TALBOT:
Exeunt
TALBOT:
SCENE III. The plains near Rouen.
TALBOT:
Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Dismay not, princes, at this accident,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
For things that are not to be remedied.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And like a peacock sweep along his tail,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.
CHARLES:
We have been guided by thee hitherto,
CHARLES:
And of thy cunning had no diffidence
CHARLES:
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Search out thy wit for secret policies,
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
And we will make thee famous through the world.
ALENCON:
We'll set thy statue in some holy place,
ALENCON:
And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint
ALENCON:
Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Then thus it must be, this doth Joan devise
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
To leave the Talbot and to follow us.
CHARLES:
Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,
CHARLES:
France were no place for Henry's warriors,
CHARLES:
Nor should that nation boast it so with us,
CHARLES:
But be extirped from our provinces.
ALENCON:
For ever should they be expulsed from France
ALENCON:
And not have title of an earldom here.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Your honours shall perceive how I will work
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
To bring this matter to the wished end.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Drum sounds afar off
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over at a distance, TALBOT and his forces
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And all the troops of English after him.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Now in the rearward comes the duke and his
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Summon a parley, we will talk with him.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Trumpets sound a parley
CHARLES:
A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!
BURGUNDY:
Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.
BURGUNDY:
What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.
CHARLES:
Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.
BURGUNDY:
Speak on, but be not over-tedious.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And see the cities and the towns defaced
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
As looks the mother on her lowly babe
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
When death doth close his tender dying eyes,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
See, see the pining malady of France,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
O, turn thy edged sword another way,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And wash away thy country's stained spots.
BURGUNDY:
Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
BURGUNDY:
Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
When Talbot hath set footing once in France
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Who then but English Henry will be lord
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And was he not in England prisoner?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
But when they heard he was thine enemy,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
They set him free without his ransom paid,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Come, come, return, return, thou wandering lord
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
BURGUNDY:
I am vanquished, these haughty words of hers
BURGUNDY:
Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,
BURGUNDY:
And made me almost yield upon my knees.
BURGUNDY:
Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,
BURGUNDY:
And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace
BURGUNDY:
My forces and my power of men are yours
BURGUNDY:
So farewell, Talbot, I'll no longer trust thee.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
[Aside]  Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!
CHARLES:
Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
And doth beget new courage in our breasts.
ALENCON:
Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,
ALENCON:
And doth deserve a coronet of gold.
CHARLES:
Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,
CHARLES:
And seek how we may prejudice the foe.
CHARLES:
Exeunt
CHARLES:
SCENE IV. Paris. The palace.
CHARLES:
Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK,  EXETER, VERNON	BASSET, and others. To them with his Soldiers, TALBOT
TALBOT:
My gracious prince, and honourable peers,
TALBOT:
Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
TALBOT:
I have awhile given truce unto my wars,
TALBOT:
To do my duty to my sovereign
TALBOT:
In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd
TALBOT:
To your obedience fifty fortresses,
TALBOT:
Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,
TALBOT:
Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,
TALBOT:
Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,
TALBOT:
And with submissive loyalty of heart
TALBOT:
Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
TALBOT:
First to my God and next unto your grace.
TALBOT:
Kneels
KING HENRY VI:
Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,
KING HENRY VI:
That hath so long been resident in France?
GLOUCESTER:
Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.
KING HENRY VI:
Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!
KING HENRY VI:
When I was young, as yet I am not old,
KING HENRY VI:
I do remember how my father said
KING HENRY VI:
A stouter champion never handled sword.
KING HENRY VI:
Long since we were resolved of your truth,
KING HENRY VI:
Your faithful service and your toil in war,
KING HENRY VI:
Yet never have you tasted our reward,
KING HENRY VI:
Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,
KING HENRY VI:
Because till now we never saw your face
KING HENRY VI:
Therefore, stand up, and, for these good deserts,
KING HENRY VI:
We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury,
KING HENRY VI:
And in our coronation take your place.
KING HENRY VI:
Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but VERNON and BASSET
VERNON:
Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,
VERNON:
Disgracing of these colours that I wear
VERNON:
In honour of my noble Lord of York
VERNON:
Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?
BASSET:
Yes, sir, as well as you dare patronage
BASSET:
The envious barking of your saucy tongue
BASSET:
Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.
VERNON:
Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.
BASSET:
Why, what is he? as good a man as York.
VERNON:
Hark ye, not so: in witness, take ye that.
VERNON:
Strikes him
BASSET:
Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
BASSET:
That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,
BASSET:
Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
BASSET:
But I'll unto his majesty, and crave
BASSET:
I may have liberty to venge this wrong,
BASSET:
When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.
VERNON:
Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you,
VERNON:
And, after, meet you sooner than you would.
VERNON:
Exeunt
VERNON:
ACT IV
VERNON:
SCENE I. Paris. A hall of state.
VERNON:
Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK, TALBOT, EXETER, the Governor, of Paris, and others
GLOUCESTER:
Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.
GLOUCESTER:
BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER:
God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!
GLOUCESTER:
Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,
GLOUCESTER:
That you elect no other king but him,
GLOUCESTER:
Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
GLOUCESTER:
And none your foes but such as shall pretend
GLOUCESTER:
Malicious practises against his state
GLOUCESTER:
This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!
GLOUCESTER:
Enter FASTOLFE
FASTOLFE:
My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,
FASTOLFE:
To haste unto your coronation,
FASTOLFE:
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
FASTOLFE:
Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.
TALBOT:
Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
TALBOT:
I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
TALBOT:
To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,
TALBOT:
Plucking it off
TALBOT:
Which I have done, because unworthily
TALBOT:
Thou wast installed in that high degree.
TALBOT:
Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest
TALBOT:
This dastard, at the battle of Patay,
TALBOT:
When but in all I was six thousand strong
TALBOT:
And that the French were almost ten to one,
TALBOT:
Before we met or that a stroke was given,
TALBOT:
Like to a trusty squire did run away
TALBOT:
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men,
TALBOT:
Myself and divers gentlemen beside
TALBOT:
Were there surprised and taken prisoners.
TALBOT:
Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss,
TALBOT:
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
TALBOT:
This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.
GLOUCESTER:
To say the truth, this fact was infamous
GLOUCESTER:
And ill beseeming any common man,
GLOUCESTER:
Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.
TALBOT:
When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,
TALBOT:
Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
TALBOT:
Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
TALBOT:
Such as were grown to credit by the wars,
TALBOT:
Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,
TALBOT:
But always resolute in most extremes.
TALBOT:
He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
TALBOT:
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
TALBOT:
Profaning this most honourable order,
TALBOT:
And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
TALBOT:
Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
TALBOT:
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.
KING HENRY VI:
Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!
KING HENRY VI:
Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight
KING HENRY VI:
Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.
KING HENRY VI:
Exit FASTOLFE
KING HENRY VI:
And now, my lord protector, view the letter
KING HENRY VI:
Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.
GLOUCESTER:
What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?
GLOUCESTER:
No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'
GLOUCESTER:
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
GLOUCESTER:
Or doth this churlish superscription
GLOUCESTER:
Pretend some alteration in good will?
GLOUCESTER:
What's here?
GLOUCESTER:
Reads
GLOUCESTER:
'I have, upon especial cause,
GLOUCESTER:
Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
GLOUCESTER:
Together with the pitiful complaints
GLOUCESTER:
Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
GLOUCESTER:
Forsaken your pernicious faction
GLOUCESTER:
And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'
GLOUCESTER:
O monstrous treachery! can this be so,
GLOUCESTER:
That in alliance, amity and oaths,
GLOUCESTER:
There should be found such false dissembling guile?
KING HENRY VI:
What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?
GLOUCESTER:
He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
KING HENRY VI:
Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
GLOUCESTER:
It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
KING HENRY VI:
Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him
KING HENRY VI:
And give him chastisement for this abuse.
KING HENRY VI:
How say you, my lord? are you not content?
TALBOT:
Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,
TALBOT:
I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.
KING HENRY VI:
Then gather strength and march unto him straight
KING HENRY VI:
Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
KING HENRY VI:
And what offence it is to flout his friends.
TALBOT:
I go, my lord, in heart desiring still
TALBOT:
You may behold confusion of your foes.
TALBOT:
Exit
TALBOT:
Enter VERNON and BASSET
VERNON:
Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.
BASSET:
And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.
YORK:
This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.
SOMERSET:
And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.
KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak.
KING HENRY VI:
Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?
KING HENRY VI:
And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?
VERNON:
With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong.
BASSET:
And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.
KING HENRY VI:
What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
KING HENRY VI:
First let me know, and then I'll answer you.
BASSET:
Crossing the sea from England into France,
BASSET:
This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,
BASSET:
Upbraided me about the rose I wear,
BASSET:
Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves
BASSET:
Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,
BASSET:
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
BASSET:
About a certain question in the law
BASSET:
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him,
BASSET:
With other vile and ignominious terms
BASSET:
In confutation of which rude reproach
BASSET:
And in defence of my lord's worthiness,
BASSET:
I crave the benefit of law of arms.
VERNON:
And that is my petition, noble lord
VERNON:
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
VERNON:
To set a gloss upon his bold intent,
VERNON:
Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him,
VERNON:
And he first took exceptions at this badge,
VERNON:
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
VERNON:
Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.
YORK:
Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?
SOMERSET:
Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,
SOMERSET:
Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.
KING HENRY VI:
Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,
KING HENRY VI:
When for so slight and frivolous a cause
KING HENRY VI:
Such factious emulations shall arise!
KING HENRY VI:
Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,
KING HENRY VI:
Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.
YORK:
Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
YORK:
And then your highness shall command a peace.
SOMERSET:
The quarrel toucheth none but us alone,
SOMERSET:
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.
YORK:
There is my pledge, accept it, Somerset.
VERNON:
Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
BASSET:
Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
GLOUCESTER:
Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!
GLOUCESTER:
And perish ye, with your audacious prate!
GLOUCESTER:
Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed
GLOUCESTER:
With this immodest clamorous outrage
GLOUCESTER:
To trouble and disturb the king and us?
GLOUCESTER:
And you, my lords, methinks you do not well
GLOUCESTER:
To bear with their perverse objections,
GLOUCESTER:
Much less to take occasion from their mouths
GLOUCESTER:
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
GLOUCESTER:
Let me persuade you take a better course.
EXETER:
It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.
KING HENRY VI:
Come hither, you that would be combatants
KING HENRY VI:
Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
KING HENRY VI:
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
KING HENRY VI:
And you, my lords, remember where we are,
KING HENRY VI:
In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation
KING HENRY VI:
If they perceive dissension in our looks
KING HENRY VI:
And that within ourselves we disagree,
KING HENRY VI:
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked
KING HENRY VI:
To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
KING HENRY VI:
Beside, what infamy will there arise,
KING HENRY VI:
When foreign princes shall be certified
KING HENRY VI:
That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
KING HENRY VI:
King Henry's peers and chief nobility
KING HENRY VI:
Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
KING HENRY VI:
O, think upon the conquest of my father,
KING HENRY VI:
My tender years, and let us not forego
KING HENRY VI:
That for a trifle that was bought with blood
KING HENRY VI:
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
KING HENRY VI:
I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
KING HENRY VI:
Putting on a red rose
KING HENRY VI:
That any one should therefore be suspicious
KING HENRY VI:
I more incline to Somerset than York
KING HENRY VI:
Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both
KING HENRY VI:
As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
KING HENRY VI:
Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.
KING HENRY VI:
But your discretions better can persuade
KING HENRY VI:
Than I am able to instruct or teach
KING HENRY VI:
And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
KING HENRY VI:
So let us still continue peace and love.
KING HENRY VI:
Cousin of York, we institute your grace
KING HENRY VI:
To be our regent in these parts of France
KING HENRY VI:
And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
KING HENRY VI:
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot,
KING HENRY VI:
And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
KING HENRY VI:
Go cheerfully together and digest.
KING HENRY VI:
Your angry choler on your enemies.
KING HENRY VI:
Ourself, my lord protector and the rest
KING HENRY VI:
After some respite will return to Calais,
KING HENRY VI:
From thence to England, where I hope ere long
KING HENRY VI:
To be presented, by your victories,
KING HENRY VI:
With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.
KING HENRY VI:
Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK, EXETER and VERNON
WARWICK:
My Lord of York, I promise you, the king
WARWICK:
Prettily, methought, did play the orator.
YORK:
And so he did, but yet I like it not,
YORK:
In that he wears the badge of Somerset.
WARWICK:
Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not,
WARWICK:
I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.
YORK:
An if I wist he did,--but let it rest,
YORK:
Other affairs must now be managed.
YORK:
Exeunt all but EXETER
EXETER:
Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice,
EXETER:
For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,
EXETER:
I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
EXETER:
More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,
EXETER:
Than yet can be imagined or supposed.
EXETER:
But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees
EXETER:
This jarring discord of nobility,
EXETER:
This shouldering of each other in the court,
EXETER:
This factious bandying of their favourites,
EXETER:
But that it doth presage some ill event.
EXETER:
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands,
EXETER:
But more when envy breeds unkind division,
EXETER:
There comes the rain, there begins confusion.
EXETER:
Exit
EXETER:
SCENE II. Before Bourdeaux.
EXETER:
Enter TALBOT, with trump and drum
TALBOT:
Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter
TALBOT:
Summon their general unto the wall.
TALBOT:
Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others, aloft
TALBOT:
English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
TALBOT:
Servant in arms to Harry King of England,
TALBOT:
And thus he would: Open your city gates,
TALBOT:
Be humble to us, call my sovereign yours,
TALBOT:
And do him homage as obedient subjects,
TALBOT:
And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power
TALBOT:
But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,
TALBOT:
You tempt the fury of my three attendants,
TALBOT:
Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire,
TALBOT:
Who in a moment even with the earth
TALBOT:
Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,
TALBOT:
If you forsake the offer of their love.
General:
Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,
General:
Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!
General:
The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
General:
On us thou canst not enter but by death,
General:
For, I protest, we are well fortified
General:
And strong enough to issue out and fight
General:
If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,
General:
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee
General:
On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,
General:
To wall thee from the liberty of flight,
General:
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,
General:
But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
General:
And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
General:
Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament
General:
To rive their dangerous artillery
General:
Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.
General:
Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,
General:
Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!
General:
This is the latest glory of thy praise
General:
That I, thy enemy, due thee withal,
General:
For ere the glass, that now begins to run,
General:
Finish the process of his sandy hour,
General:
These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,
General:
Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.
General:
Drum afar off
General:
Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,
General:
Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul,
General:
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.
General:
Exeunt General,  and c
TALBOT:
He fables not, I hear the enemy
TALBOT:
Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
TALBOT:
O, negligent and heedless discipline!
TALBOT:
How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,
TALBOT:
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
TALBOT:
Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!
TALBOT:
If we be English deer, be then in blood,
TALBOT:
Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,
TALBOT:
But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,
TALBOT:
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
TALBOT:
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay
TALBOT:
Sell every man his life as dear as mine,
TALBOT:
And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
TALBOT:
God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,
TALBOT:
Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!
TALBOT:
Exeunt
TALBOT:
SCENE III. Plains in Gascony.
TALBOT:
Enter a Messenger that meets YORK. Enter YORK with trumpet and many Soldiers
YORK:
Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,
YORK:
That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?
Messenger:
They are return'd, my lord, and give it out
Messenger:
That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,
Messenger:
To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,
Messenger:
By your espials were discovered
Messenger:
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,
Messenger:
Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.
YORK:
A plague upon that villain Somerset,
YORK:
That thus delays my promised supply
YORK:
Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
YORK:
Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,
YORK:
And I am lowted by a traitor villain
YORK:
And cannot help the noble chevalier
YORK:
God comfort him in this necessity!
YORK:
If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.
YORK:
Enter Sir William LUCY
LUCY:
Thou princely leader of our English strength,
LUCY:
Never so needful on the earth of France,
LUCY:
Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,
LUCY:
Who now is girdled with a waist of iron
LUCY:
And hemm'd about with grim destruction
LUCY:
To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!
LUCY:
Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.
YORK:
O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart
YORK:
Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
YORK:
So should we save a valiant gentleman
YORK:
By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.
YORK:
Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,
YORK:
That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.
LUCY:
O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!
YORK:
He dies, we lose, I break my warlike word,
YORK:
We mourn, France smiles, we lose, they daily get,
YORK:
All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.
LUCY:
Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul,
LUCY:
And on his son young John, who two hours since
LUCY:
I met in travel toward his warlike father!
LUCY:
This seven years did not Talbot see his son,
LUCY:
And now they meet where both their lives are done.
YORK:
Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have
YORK:
To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
YORK:
Away! vexation almost stops my breath,
YORK:
That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.
YORK:
Lucy, farewell, no more my fortune can,
YORK:
But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.
YORK:
Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,
YORK:
'Long all of Somerset and his delay.
YORK:
Exit, with his soldiers
LUCY:
Thus, while the vulture of sedition
LUCY:
Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,
LUCY:
Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
LUCY:
The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,
LUCY:
That ever living man of memory,
LUCY:
Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
LUCY:
Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss.
LUCY:
Exit
LUCY:
SCENE IV. Other plains in Gascony.
LUCY:
Enter SOMERSET, with his army, a Captain of TALBOT's with him
SOMERSET:
It is too late, I cannot send them now
SOMERSET:
This expedition was by York and Talbot
SOMERSET:
Too rashly plotted: all our general force
SOMERSET:
Might with a sally of the very town
SOMERSET:
Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot
SOMERSET:
Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
SOMERSET:
By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure
SOMERSET:
York set him on to fight and die in shame,
SOMERSET:
That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.
Captain:
Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me
Captain:
Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.
Captain:
Enter Sir William LUCY
SOMERSET:
How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?
LUCY:
Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot,
LUCY:
Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,
LUCY:
Cries out for noble York and Somerset,
LUCY:
To beat assailing death from his weak legions
LUCY:
And whiles the honourable captain there
LUCY:
Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,
LUCY:
And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,
LUCY:
You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,
LUCY:
Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
LUCY:
Let not your private discord keep away
LUCY:
The levied succors that should lend him aid,
LUCY:
While he, renowned noble gentleman,
LUCY:
Yields up his life unto a world of odds
LUCY:
Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,
LUCY:
Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,
LUCY:
And Talbot perisheth by your default.
SOMERSET:
York set him on, York should have sent him aid.
LUCY:
And York as fast upon your grace exclaims,
LUCY:
Swearing that you withhold his levied host,
LUCY:
Collected for this expedition.
SOMERSET:
York lies, he might have sent and had the horse,
SOMERSET:
I owe him little duty, and less love,
SOMERSET:
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.
LUCY:
The fraud of England, not the force of France,
LUCY:
Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot
LUCY:
Never to England shall he bear his life,
LUCY:
But dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife.
SOMERSET:
Come, go, I will dispatch the horsemen straight
SOMERSET:
Within six hours they will be at his aid.
LUCY:
Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain,
LUCY:
For fly he could not, if he would have fled,
LUCY:
And fly would Talbot never, though he might.
SOMERSET:
If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!
LUCY:
His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.
LUCY:
Exeunt
LUCY:
SCENE V. The English camp near Bourdeaux.
LUCY:
Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son
TALBOT:
O young John Talbot! I did send for thee
TALBOT:
To tutor thee in stratagems of war,
TALBOT:
That Talbot's name might be in thee revived
TALBOT:
When sapless age and weak unable limbs
TALBOT:
Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
TALBOT:
But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!
TALBOT:
Now thou art come unto a feast of death,
TALBOT:
A terrible and unavoided danger
TALBOT:
Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
TALBOT:
And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
TALBOT:
By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.
JOHN TALBOT:
Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?
JOHN TALBOT:
And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,
JOHN TALBOT:
Dishonour not her honourable name,
JOHN TALBOT:
To make a bastard and a slave of me!
JOHN TALBOT:
The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,
JOHN TALBOT:
That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.
TALBOT:
Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.
JOHN TALBOT:
He that flies so will ne'er return again.
TALBOT:
If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
JOHN TALBOT:
Then let me stay, and, father, do you fly
JOHN TALBOT:
Your loss is great, so your regard should be,
JOHN TALBOT:
My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.
JOHN TALBOT:
Upon my death the French can little boast,
JOHN TALBOT:
In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.
JOHN TALBOT:
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won,
JOHN TALBOT:
But mine it will, that no exploit have done
JOHN TALBOT:
You fled for vantage, everyone will swear,
JOHN TALBOT:
But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.
JOHN TALBOT:
There is no hope that ever I will stay,
JOHN TALBOT:
If the first hour I shrink and run away.
JOHN TALBOT:
Here on my knee I beg mortality,
JOHN TALBOT:
Rather than life preserved with infamy.
TALBOT:
Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
JOHN TALBOT:
Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.
TALBOT:
Upon my blessing, I command thee go.
JOHN TALBOT:
To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.
TALBOT:
Part of thy father may be saved in thee.
JOHN TALBOT:
No part of him but will be shame in me.
TALBOT:
Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.
JOHN TALBOT:
Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?
TALBOT:
Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
JOHN TALBOT:
You cannot witness for me, being slain.
JOHN TALBOT:
If death be so apparent, then both fly.
TALBOT:
And leave my followers here to fight and die?
TALBOT:
My age was never tainted with such shame.
JOHN TALBOT:
And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
JOHN TALBOT:
No more can I be sever'd from your side,
JOHN TALBOT:
Than can yourself yourself in twain divide
JOHN TALBOT:
Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I,
JOHN TALBOT:
For live I will not, if my father die.
TALBOT:
Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,
TALBOT:
Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.
TALBOT:
Come, side by side together live and die.
TALBOT:
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.
TALBOT:
Exeunt
TALBOT:
SCENE VI. A field of battle.
TALBOT:
Alarum: excursions, wherein JOHN TALBOT is hemmed about, and TALBOT rescues him
TALBOT:
Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.
TALBOT:
The regent hath with Talbot broke his word
TALBOT:
And left us to the rage of France his sword.
TALBOT:
Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath,
TALBOT:
I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.
JOHN TALBOT:
O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
JOHN TALBOT:
The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,
JOHN TALBOT:
Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late,
JOHN TALBOT:
To my determined time thou gavest new date.
TALBOT:
When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,
TALBOT:
It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
TALBOT:
Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,
TALBOT:
Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
TALBOT:
Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,
TALBOT:
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.
TALBOT:
The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood
TALBOT:
From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
TALBOT:
Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,
TALBOT:
And interchanging blows I quickly shed
TALBOT:
Some of his bastard blood, and in disgrace
TALBOT:
Bespoke him thus, 'Contaminated, base
TALBOT:
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
TALBOT:
Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
TALBOT:
Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'
TALBOT:
Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,
TALBOT:
Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,
TALBOT:
Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?
TALBOT:
Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
TALBOT:
Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?
TALBOT:
Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead
TALBOT:
The help of one stands me in little stead.
TALBOT:
O, too much folly is it, well I wot,
TALBOT:
To hazard all our lives in one small boat!
TALBOT:
If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,
TALBOT:
To-morrow I shall die with mickle age
TALBOT:
By me they nothing gain an if I stay,
TALBOT:
'Tis but the shortening of my life one day
TALBOT:
In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,
TALBOT:
My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame
TALBOT:
All these and more we hazard by thy stay,
TALBOT:
All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.
JOHN TALBOT:
The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart,
JOHN TALBOT:
These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart
JOHN TALBOT:
On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
JOHN TALBOT:
To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,
JOHN TALBOT:
Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,
JOHN TALBOT:
The coward horse that bears me fail and die!
JOHN TALBOT:
And like me to the peasant boys of France,
JOHN TALBOT:
To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!
JOHN TALBOT:
Surely, by all the glory you have won,
JOHN TALBOT:
An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son
JOHN TALBOT:
Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot,
JOHN TALBOT:
If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.
TALBOT:
Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,
TALBOT:
Thou Icarus, thy life to me is sweet
TALBOT:
If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side,
TALBOT:
And, commendable proved, let's die in pride.
TALBOT:
Exeunt
TALBOT:
SCENE VII. Another part of the field.
TALBOT:
Alarum: excursions. Enter TALBOT led by a Servant
TALBOT:
Where is my other life? mine own is gone,
TALBOT:
O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?
TALBOT:
Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,
TALBOT:
Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee
TALBOT:
When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,
TALBOT:
His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
TALBOT:
And, like a hungry lion, did commence
TALBOT:
Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience,
TALBOT:
But when my angry guardant stood alone,
TALBOT:
Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,
TALBOT:
Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart
TALBOT:
Suddenly made him from my side to start
TALBOT:
Into the clustering battle of the French,
TALBOT:
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
TALBOT:
His over-mounting spirit, and there died,
TALBOT:
My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.
Servant:
O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!
Servant:
Enter Soldiers, with the body of JOHN TALBOT
TALBOT:
Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,
TALBOT:
Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,
TALBOT:
Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,
TALBOT:
Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,
TALBOT:
In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.
TALBOT:
O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,
TALBOT:
Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
TALBOT:
Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no,
TALBOT:
Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.
TALBOT:
Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
TALBOT:
Had death been French, then death had died to-day.
TALBOT:
Come, come and lay him in his father's arms
TALBOT:
My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
TALBOT:
Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,
TALBOT:
Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
TALBOT:
Dies
TALBOT:
Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BURGUNDY, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces
CHARLES:
Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,
CHARLES:
We should have found a bloody day of this.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
But, with a proud majestical high scorn,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
So, rushing in the bowels of the French,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.
BURGUNDY:
Doubtless he would have made a noble knight,
BURGUNDY:
See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms
BURGUNDY:
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder
BASTARD OF ORLEANS:
Whose life was England's glory, Gallia's wonder.
CHARLES:
O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled
CHARLES:
During the life, let us not wrong it dead.
CHARLES:
Enter Sir William LUCY, attended, Herald of the French preceding
LUCY:
Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,
LUCY:
To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.
CHARLES:
On what submissive message art thou sent?
LUCY:
Submission, Dauphin! 'tis a mere French word,
LUCY:
We English warriors wot not what it means.
LUCY:
I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en
LUCY:
And to survey the bodies of the dead.
CHARLES:
For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is.
CHARLES:
But tell me whom thou seek'st.
LUCY:
But where's the great Alcides of the field,
LUCY:
Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,
LUCY:
Created, for his rare success in arms,
LUCY:
Great Earl of Washford, Waterford and Valence,
LUCY:
Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,
LUCY:
Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton,
LUCY:
Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield,
LUCY:
The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge,
LUCY:
Knight of the noble order of Saint George,
LUCY:
Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece,
LUCY:
Great marshal to Henry the Sixth
LUCY:
Of all his wars within the realm of France?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Here is a silly stately style indeed!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Writes not so tedious a style as this.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.
LUCY:
Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge,
LUCY:
Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis?
LUCY:
O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,
LUCY:
That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!
LUCY:
O, that I could but call these dead to life!
LUCY:
It were enough to fright the realm of France
LUCY:
Were but his picture left amongst you here,
LUCY:
It would amaze the proudest of you all.
LUCY:
Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence
LUCY:
And give them burial as beseems their worth.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
For God's sake let him have 'em, to keep them here,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
They would but stink, and putrefy the air.
CHARLES:
Go, take their bodies hence.
LUCY:
I'll bear them hence, but from their ashes shall be rear'd
LUCY:
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
CHARLES:
So we be rid of them, do with 'em what thou wilt.
CHARLES:
And now to Paris, in this conquering vein
CHARLES:
All will be ours, now bloody Talbot's slain.
CHARLES:
Exeunt
CHARLES:
ACT V
CHARLES:
SCENE I. London. The palace.
CHARLES:
Sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, and EXETER
KING HENRY VI:
Have you perused the letters from the pope,
KING HENRY VI:
The emperor and the Earl of Armagnac?
GLOUCESTER:
I have, my lord: and their intent is this
GLOUCESTER:
They humbly sue unto your excellence
GLOUCESTER:
To have a godly peace concluded of
GLOUCESTER:
Between the realms of England and of France.
KING HENRY VI:
How doth your grace affect their motion?
GLOUCESTER:
Well, my good lord, and as the only means
GLOUCESTER:
To stop effusion of our Christian blood
GLOUCESTER:
And 'stablish quietness on every side.
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, marry, uncle, for I always thought
KING HENRY VI:
It was both impious and unnatural
KING HENRY VI:
That such immanity and bloody strife
KING HENRY VI:
Should reign among professors of one faith.
GLOUCESTER:
Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect
GLOUCESTER:
And surer bind this knot of amity,
GLOUCESTER:
The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,
GLOUCESTER:
A man of great authority in France,
GLOUCESTER:
Proffers his only daughter to your grace
GLOUCESTER:
In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.
KING HENRY VI:
Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
KING HENRY VI:
And fitter is my study and my books
KING HENRY VI:
Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.
KING HENRY VI:
Yet call the ambassador, and, as you please,
KING HENRY VI:
So let them have their answers every one
KING HENRY VI:
I shall be well content with any choice
KING HENRY VI:
Tends to God's glory and my country's weal.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER in Cardinal's habit, a Legate and two Ambassadors
EXETER:
What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd,
EXETER:
And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?
EXETER:
Then I perceive that will be verified
EXETER:
Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy,
EXETER:
'If once he come to be a cardinal,
EXETER:
He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.'
KING HENRY VI:
My lords ambassadors, your several suits
KING HENRY VI:
Have been consider'd and debated on.
KING HENRY VI:
And therefore are we certainly resolved
KING HENRY VI:
To draw conditions of a friendly peace,
KING HENRY VI:
Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
KING HENRY VI:
Shall be transported presently to France.
GLOUCESTER:
And for the proffer of my lord your master,
GLOUCESTER:
I have inform'd his highness so at large
GLOUCESTER:
As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,
GLOUCESTER:
Her beauty and the value of her dower,
GLOUCESTER:
He doth intend she shall be England's queen.
KING HENRY VI:
In argument and proof of which contract,
KING HENRY VI:
Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.
KING HENRY VI:
And so, my lord protector, see them guarded
KING HENRY VI:
And safely brought to Dover, where inshipp'd
KING HENRY VI:
Commit them to the fortune of the sea.
KING HENRY VI:
Exeunt all but CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER and Legate
KING HENRY VI:
CARDINAL
OF WINCHESTER:
Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive
OF WINCHESTER:
The sum of money which I promised
OF WINCHESTER:
Should be deliver'd to his holiness
OF WINCHESTER:
For clothing me in these grave ornaments.
Legate:
I will attend upon your lordship's leisure.
Legate:
CARDINAL
OF WINCHESTER:
[Aside]  Now Winchester will not submit, I trow,
OF WINCHESTER:
Or be inferior to the proudest peer.
OF WINCHESTER:
Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive
OF WINCHESTER:
That, neither in birth or for authority,
OF WINCHESTER:
The bishop will be overborne by thee
OF WINCHESTER:
I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,
OF WINCHESTER:
Or sack this country with a mutiny.
OF WINCHESTER:
Exeunt
OF WINCHESTER:
SCENE II. France. Plains in Anjou.
OF WINCHESTER:
Enter CHARLES, BURGUNDY, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces
CHARLES:
These news, my lord, may cheer our drooping spirits
CHARLES:
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
CHARLES:
And turn again unto the warlike French.
ALENCON:
Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,
ALENCON:
And keep not back your powers in dalliance.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Else, ruin combat with their palaces!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Enter Scout
Scout:
Success unto our valiant general,
Scout:
And happiness to his accomplices!
CHARLES:
What tidings send our scouts? I prithee, speak.
Scout:
The English army, that divided was
Scout:
Into two parties, is now conjoined in one,
Scout:
And means to give you battle presently.
CHARLES:
Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is,
CHARLES:
But we will presently provide for them.
BURGUNDY:
I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there
BURGUNDY:
Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
CHARLES:
Then on, my lords, and France be fortunate!
CHARLES:
Exeunt
CHARLES:
SCENE III. Before Angiers.
CHARLES:
Alarum. Excursions. Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
The regent conquers, and the Frenchmen fly.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Now help, ye charming spells and periapts,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And ye choice spirits that admonish me
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And give me signs of future accidents.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Thunder
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
You speedy helpers, that are substitutes
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Under the lordly monarch of the north,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Appear and aid me in this enterprise.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Enter Fiends
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
This speedy and quick appearance argues proof
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Of your accustom'd diligence to me.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Out of the powerful regions under earth,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Help me this once, that France may get the field.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
They walk, and speak not
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
O, hold me not with silence over-long!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I'll lop a member off and give it you
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
In earnest of further benefit,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
So you do condescend to help me now.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
They hang their heads
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
No hope to have redress? My body shall
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
They shake their heads
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Before that England give the French the foil.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
They depart
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
See, they forsake me! Now the time is come
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And let her head fall into England's lap.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
My ancient incantations are too weak,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And hell too strong for me to buckle with
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Exit
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Excursions. Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE fighting hand  to hand with YORK. JOAN LA PUCELLE is taken. The French fly.
YORK:
Damsel of France, I think I have you fast
YORK:
Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
YORK:
And try if they can gain your liberty.
YORK:
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
YORK:
See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,
YORK:
As if with Circe she would change my shape!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.
YORK:
O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man,
YORK:
No shape but his can please your dainty eye.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
And may ye both be suddenly surprised
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!
YORK:
Fell banning hag, enchantress, hold thy tongue!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I prithee, give me leave to curse awhile.
YORK:
Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake.
YORK:
Exeunt
YORK:
Alarum. Enter SUFFOLK with MARGARET in his hand
SUFFOLK:
Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
SUFFOLK:
Gazes on her
SUFFOLK:
O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!
SUFFOLK:
For I will touch thee but with reverent hands,
SUFFOLK:
I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,
SUFFOLK:
And lay them gently on thy tender side.
SUFFOLK:
Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee.
MARGARET:
Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
MARGARET:
The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.
SUFFOLK:
An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.
SUFFOLK:
Be not offended, nature's miracle,
SUFFOLK:
Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me
SUFFOLK:
So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
SUFFOLK:
Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.
SUFFOLK:
Yet, if this servile usage once offend.
SUFFOLK:
Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.
SUFFOLK:
She is going
SUFFOLK:
O, stay! I have no power to let her pass,
SUFFOLK:
My hand would free her, but my heart says no
SUFFOLK:
As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
SUFFOLK:
Twinkling another counterfeited beam,
SUFFOLK:
So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
SUFFOLK:
Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak
SUFFOLK:
I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.
SUFFOLK:
Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself,
SUFFOLK:
Hast not a tongue? is she not here?
SUFFOLK:
Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?
SUFFOLK:
Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,
SUFFOLK:
Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
MARGARET:
Say, Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so--
MARGARET:
What ransom must I pay before I pass?
MARGARET:
For I perceive I am thy prisoner.
SUFFOLK:
How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,
SUFFOLK:
Before thou make a trial of her love?
MARGARET:
Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?
SUFFOLK:
She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd,
SUFFOLK:
She is a woman, therefore to be won.
MARGARET:
Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.
SUFFOLK:
Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife,
SUFFOLK:
Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?
MARGARET:
I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.
SUFFOLK:
There all is marr'd, there lies a cooling card.
MARGARET:
He talks at random, sure, the man is mad.
SUFFOLK:
And yet a dispensation may be had.
MARGARET:
And yet I would that you would answer me.
SUFFOLK:
I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?
SUFFOLK:
Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!
MARGARET:
He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.
SUFFOLK:
Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
SUFFOLK:
And peace established between these realms
SUFFOLK:
But there remains a scruple in that too,
SUFFOLK:
For though her father be the King of Naples,
SUFFOLK:
Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
SUFFOLK:
And our nobility will scorn the match.
MARGARET:
Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?
SUFFOLK:
It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.
SUFFOLK:
Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
SUFFOLK:
Madam, I have a secret to reveal.
MARGARET:
What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,
MARGARET:
And will not any way dishonour me.
SUFFOLK:
Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.
MARGARET:
Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French,
MARGARET:
And then I need not crave his courtesy.
SUFFOLK:
Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--
MARGARET:
Tush, women have been captivate ere now.
SUFFOLK:
Lady, wherefore talk you so?
MARGARET:
I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.
SUFFOLK:
Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose
SUFFOLK:
Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?
MARGARET:
To be a queen in bondage is more vile
MARGARET:
Than is a slave in base servility,
MARGARET:
For princes should be free.
SUFFOLK:
And so shall you,
SUFFOLK:
If happy England's royal king be free.
MARGARET:
Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
SUFFOLK:
I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,
SUFFOLK:
To put a golden sceptre in thy hand
SUFFOLK:
And set a precious crown upon thy head,
SUFFOLK:
If thou wilt condescend to be my--
MARGARET:
What?
SUFFOLK:
His love.
MARGARET:
I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
SUFFOLK:
No, gentle madam, I unworthy am
SUFFOLK:
To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,
SUFFOLK:
And have no portion in the choice myself.
SUFFOLK:
How say you, madam, are ye so content?
MARGARET:
An if my father please, I am content.
SUFFOLK:
Then call our captains and our colours forth.
SUFFOLK:
And, madam, at your father's castle walls
SUFFOLK:
We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.
SUFFOLK:
A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls
SUFFOLK:
See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!
REIGNIER:
To whom?
SUFFOLK:
To me.
REIGNIER:
Suffolk, what remedy?
REIGNIER:
I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,
REIGNIER:
Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.
SU FFOLK:
Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord
SU FFOLK:
Consent, and for thy honour give consent,
SU FFOLK:
Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,
SU FFOLK:
Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto,
SU FFOLK:
And this her easy-held imprisonment
SU FFOLK:
Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.
REIGNIER:
Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
SUFFOLK:
Fair Margaret knows
SUFFOLK:
That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.
REIGNIER:
Upon thy princely warrant, I descend
REIGNIER:
To give thee answer of thy just demand.
REIGNIER:
Exit from the walls
SUFFOLK:
And here I will expect thy coming.
SUFFOLK:
Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below
REIGNIER:
Welcome, brave earl, into our territories
REIGNIER:
Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.
SUFFOLK:
Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
SUFFOLK:
Fit to be made companion with a king
SUFFOLK:
What answer makes your grace unto my suit?
REIGNIER:
Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
REIGNIER:
To be the princely bride of such a lord,
REIGNIER:
Upon condition I may quietly
REIGNIER:
Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,
REIGNIER:
Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
REIGNIER:
My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
SUFFOLK:
That is her ransom, I deliver her,
SUFFOLK:
And those two counties I will undertake
SUFFOLK:
Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
REIGNIER:
And I again, in Henry's royal name,
REIGNIER:
As deputy unto that gracious king,
REIGNIER:
Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.
SUFFOLK:
Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
SUFFOLK:
Because this is in traffic of a king.
SUFFOLK:
Aside
SUFFOLK:
And yet, methinks, I could be well content
SUFFOLK:
To be mine own attorney in this case.
SUFFOLK:
I'll over then to England with this news,
SUFFOLK:
And make this marriage to be solemnized.
SUFFOLK:
So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe
SUFFOLK:
In golden palaces, as it becomes.
REIGNIER:
I do embrace thee, as I would embrace
REIGNIER:
The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.
MARGARET:
Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers
MARGARET:
Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.
MARGARET:
Going
SUFFOLK:
Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret,
SUFFOLK:
No princely commendations to my king?
MARGARET:
Such commendations as becomes a maid,
MARGARET:
A virgin and his servant, say to him.
SUFFOLK:
Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.
SUFFOLK:
But madam, I must trouble you again,
SUFFOLK:
No loving token to his majesty?
MARGARET:
Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,
MARGARET:
Never yet taint with love, I send the king.
SUFFOLK:
And this withal.
SUFFOLK:
Kisses her
MARGARET:
That for thyself: I will not so presume
MARGARET:
To send such peevish tokens to a king.
MARGARET:
Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET
SUFFOLK:
O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay,
SUFFOLK:
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth,
SUFFOLK:
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
SUFFOLK:
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise
SUFFOLK:
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,
SUFFOLK:
And natural graces that extinguish art,
SUFFOLK:
Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
SUFFOLK:
That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,
SUFFOLK:
Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.
SUFFOLK:
Exit
SUFFOLK:
SCENE IV. Camp of the YORK in Anjou.
SUFFOLK:
Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others
YORK:
Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
YORK:
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a Shepherd
Shepherd:
Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
Shepherd:
Have I sought every country far and near,
Shepherd:
And, now it is my chance to find thee out,
Shepherd:
Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
Shepherd:
Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I am descended of a gentler blood
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
Shepherd:
Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so,
Shepherd:
I did beget her, all the parish knows
Shepherd:
Her mother liveth yet, can testify
Shepherd:
She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.
WARWICK:
Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?
YORK:
This argues what her kind of life hath been,
YORK:
Wicked and vile, and so her death concludes.
Shepherd:
Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
Shepherd:
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh,
Shepherd:
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear
Shepherd:
Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
Shepherd:
'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest
Shepherd:
The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
Shepherd:
Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
Shepherd:
Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
Shepherd:
Of thy nativity! I would the milk
Shepherd:
Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,
Shepherd:
Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
Shepherd:
Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
Shepherd:
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!
Shepherd:
Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?
Shepherd:
O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.
Shepherd:
Exit
YORK:
Take her away, for she hath lived too long,
YORK:
To fill the world with vicious qualities.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
But issued from the progeny of kings,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Virtuous and holy, chosen from above,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
By inspiration of celestial grace,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
To work exceeding miracles on earth.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I never had to do with wicked spirits
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
But you, that are polluted with your lusts,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Because you want the grace that others have,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
You judge it straight a thing impossible
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
To compass wonders but by help of devils.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
A virgin from her tender infancy,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Chaste and immaculate in very thought,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
YORK:
Ay, ay: away with her to execution!
WARWICK:
And hark ye, sirs, because she is a maid,
WARWICK:
Spare for no faggots, let there be enow
WARWICK:
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,
WARWICK:
That so her torture may be shortened.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
I am with child, ye bloody homicides
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Although ye hale me to a violent death.
YORK:
Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!
WARWICK:
The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought
WARWICK:
Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
YORK:
She and the Dauphin have been juggling
YORK:
I did imagine what would be her refuge.
WARWICK:
Well, go to, we'll have no bastards live,
WARWICK:
Especially since Charles must father it.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
You are deceived, my child is none of his
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.
YORK:
Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!
YORK:
It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
O, give me leave, I have deluded you
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd.
WARWICK:
A married man! that's most intolerable.
YORK:
Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,
YORK:
There were so many, whom she may accuse.
WARWICK:
It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
YORK:
And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.
YORK:
Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee
YORK:
Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Then lead me hence, with whom I leave my curse
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
May never glorious sun reflex his beams
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Upon the country where you make abode,
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Environ you, till mischief and despair
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
JOAN LA PUCELLE:
Exit, guarded
YORK:
Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,
YORK:
Thou foul accursed minister of hell!
YORK:
Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER, attended
YORK:
CARDINAL
OF WINCHESTER:
Lord regent, I do greet your excellence
OF WINCHESTER:
With letters of commission from the king.
OF WINCHESTER:
For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,
OF WINCHESTER:
Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,
OF WINCHESTER:
Have earnestly implored a general peace
OF WINCHESTER:
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French,
OF WINCHESTER:
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
OF WINCHESTER:
Approacheth, to confer about some matter.
YORK:
Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
YORK:
After the slaughter of so many peers,
YORK:
So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,
YORK:
That in this quarrel have been overthrown
YORK:
And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,
YORK:
Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
YORK:
Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
YORK:
By treason, falsehood and by treachery,
YORK:
Our great progenitors had conquered?
YORK:
O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
YORK:
The utter loss of all the realm of France.
WARWICK:
Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,
WARWICK:
It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
WARWICK:
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.
WARWICK:
Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, and others
CHARLES:
Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed
CHARLES:
That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,
CHARLES:
We come to be informed by yourselves
CHARLES:
What the conditions of that league must be.
YORK:
Speak, Winchester, for boiling choler chokes
YORK:
The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,
YORK:
By sight of these our baleful enemies.
YORK:
CARDINAL
OF WINCHESTER:
Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus
OF WINCHESTER:
That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
OF WINCHESTER:
Of mere compassion and of lenity,
OF WINCHESTER:
To ease your country of distressful war,
OF WINCHESTER:
And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
OF WINCHESTER:
You shall become true liegemen to his crown
OF WINCHESTER:
And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
OF WINCHESTER:
To pay him tribute, submit thyself,
OF WINCHESTER:
Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,
OF WINCHESTER:
And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
ALENCON:
Must he be then as shadow of himself?
ALENCON:
Adorn his temples with a coronet,
ALENCON:
And yet, in substance and authority,
ALENCON:
Retain but privilege of a private man?
ALENCON:
This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
CHARLES:
'Tis known already that I am possess'd
CHARLES:
With more than half the Gallian territories,
CHARLES:
And therein reverenced for their lawful king
CHARLES:
Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,
CHARLES:
Detract so much from that prerogative,
CHARLES:
As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
CHARLES:
No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
CHARLES:
That which I have than, coveting for more,
CHARLES:
Be cast from possibility of all.
YORK:
Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means
YORK:
Used intercession to obtain a league,
YORK:
And, now the matter grows to compromise,
YORK:
Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?
YORK:
Either accept the title thou usurp'st,
YORK:
Of benefit proceeding from our king
YORK:
And not of any challenge of desert,
YORK:
Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.
REIGNIER:
My lord, you do not well in obstinacy
REIGNIER:
To cavil in the course of this contract
REIGNIER:
If once it be neglected, ten to one
REIGNIER:
We shall not find like opportunity.
ALENCON:
To say the truth, it is your policy
ALENCON:
To save your subjects from such massacre
ALENCON:
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
ALENCON:
By our proceeding in hostility,
ALENCON:
And therefore take this compact of a truce,
ALENCON:
Although you break it when your pleasure serves.
WARWICK:
How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?
CHARLES:
It shall,
CHARLES:
Only reserved, you claim no interest
CHARLES:
In any of our towns of garrison.
YORK:
Then swear allegiance to his majesty,
YORK:
As thou art knight, never to disobey
YORK:
Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,
YORK:
Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.
YORK:
So, now dismiss your army when ye please
YORK:
Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,
YORK:
For here we entertain a solemn peace.
YORK:
Exeunt
YORK:
SCENE V. London. The palace.
YORK:
Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER and EXETER
KING HENRY VI:
Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
KING HENRY VI:
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me
KING HENRY VI:
Her virtues graced with external gifts
KING HENRY VI:
Do breed love's settled passions in my heart
KING HENRY VI:
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
KING HENRY VI:
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
KING HENRY VI:
So am I driven by breath of her renown
KING HENRY VI:
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
KING HENRY VI:
Where I may have fruition of her love.
SUFFOLK:
Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
SUFFOLK:
Is but a preface of her worthy praise,
SUFFOLK:
The chief perfections of that lovely dame
SUFFOLK:
Had I sufficient skill to utter them,
SUFFOLK:
Would make a volume of enticing lines,
SUFFOLK:
Able to ravish any dull conceit
SUFFOLK:
And, which is more, she is not so divine,
SUFFOLK:
So full-replete with choice of all delights,
SUFFOLK:
But with as humble lowliness of mind
SUFFOLK:
She is content to be at your command,
SUFFOLK:
Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
SUFFOLK:
To love and honour Henry as her lord.
KING HENRY VI:
And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
KING HENRY VI:
Therefore, my lord protector, give consent
KING HENRY VI:
That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
GLOUCESTER:
So should I give consent to flatter sin.
GLOUCESTER:
You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd
GLOUCESTER:
Unto another lady of esteem
GLOUCESTER:
How shall we then dispense with that contract,
GLOUCESTER:
And not deface your honour with reproach?
SUFFOLK:
As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths,
SUFFOLK:
Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd
SUFFOLK:
To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
SUFFOLK:
By reason of his adversary's odds
SUFFOLK:
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
SUFFOLK:
And therefore may be broke without offence.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
GLOUCESTER:
Her father is no better than an earl,
GLOUCESTER:
Although in glorious titles he excel.
SUFFOLK:
Yes, lord, her father is a king,
SUFFOLK:
The King of Naples and Jerusalem,
SUFFOLK:
And of such great authority in France
SUFFOLK:
As his alliance will confirm our peace
SUFFOLK:
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
GLOUCESTER:
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
GLOUCESTER:
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
EXETER:
Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
EXETER:
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
SUFFOLK:
A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
SUFFOLK:
That he should be so abject, base and poor,
SUFFOLK:
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
SUFFOLK:
Henry is able to enrich his queen
SUFFOLK:
And not seek a queen to make him rich
SUFFOLK:
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
SUFFOLK:
As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
SUFFOLK:
Marriage is a matter of more worth
SUFFOLK:
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship,
SUFFOLK:
Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
SUFFOLK:
Must be companion of his nuptial bed
SUFFOLK:
And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
SUFFOLK:
It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
SUFFOLK:
In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
SUFFOLK:
For what is wedlock forced but a hell,
SUFFOLK:
An age of discord and continual strife?
SUFFOLK:
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
SUFFOLK:
And is a pattern of celestial peace.
SUFFOLK:
Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
SUFFOLK:
But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
SUFFOLK:
Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
SUFFOLK:
Approves her fit for none but for a king
SUFFOLK:
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,
SUFFOLK:
More than in women commonly is seen,
SUFFOLK:
Will answer our hope in issue of a king,
SUFFOLK:
For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
SUFFOLK:
Is likely to beget more conquerors,
SUFFOLK:
If with a lady of so high resolve
SUFFOLK:
As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
SUFFOLK:
Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me
SUFFOLK:
That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.
KING HENRY VI:
Whether it be through force of your report,
KING HENRY VI:
My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that
KING HENRY VI:
My tender youth was never yet attaint
KING HENRY VI:
With any passion of inflaming love,
KING HENRY VI:
I cannot tell, but this I am assured,
KING HENRY VI:
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
KING HENRY VI:
Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
KING HENRY VI:
As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
KING HENRY VI:
Take, therefore, shipping, post, my lord, to France,
KING HENRY VI:
Agree to any covenants, and procure
KING HENRY VI:
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
KING HENRY VI:
To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
KING HENRY VI:
King Henry's faithful and anointed queen
KING HENRY VI:
For your expenses and sufficient charge,
KING HENRY VI:
Among the people gather up a tenth.
KING HENRY VI:
Be gone, I say, for, till you do return,
KING HENRY VI:
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
KING HENRY VI:
And you, good uncle, banish all offence
KING HENRY VI:
If you do censure me by what you were,
KING HENRY VI:
Not what you are, I know it will excuse
KING HENRY VI:
This sudden execution of my will.
KING HENRY VI:
And so, conduct me where, from company,
KING HENRY VI:
I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
KING HENRY VI:
Exit
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER
SUFFOLK:
Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd, and thus he goes,
SUFFOLK:
As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,
SUFFOLK:
With hope to find the like event in love,
SUFFOLK:
But prosper better than the Trojan did.
SUFFOLK:
Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king,
SUFFOLK:
But I will rule both her, the king and realm.
SUFFOLK:
Exit
