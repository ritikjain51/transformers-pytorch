RICHMOND:
ACT I
RICHMOND:
PROLOGUE
RICHMOND:
Two households, both alike in dignity,
RICHMOND:
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
RICHMOND:
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
RICHMOND:
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
RICHMOND:
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
RICHMOND:
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life,
RICHMOND:
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
RICHMOND:
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
RICHMOND:
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
RICHMOND:
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
RICHMOND:
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
RICHMOND:
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage,
RICHMOND:
The which if you with patient ears attend,
RICHMOND:
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
RICHMOND:
SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
RICHMOND:
Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
SAMPSON:
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
GREGORY:
No, for then we should be colliers.
SAMPSON:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
GREGORY:
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
SAMPSON:
I strike quickly, being moved.
GREGORY:
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
SAMPSON:
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
GREGORY:
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand
GREGORY:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
SAMPSON:
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
SAMPSON:
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
GREGORY:
That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes
GREGORY:
to the wall.
SAMPSON:
True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
SAMPSON:
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
SAMPSON:
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
SAMPSON:
to the wall.
GREGORY:
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
SAMPSON:
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
SAMPSON:
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
SAMPSON:
maids, and cut off their heads.
GREGORY:
The heads of the maids?
SAMPSON:
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads,
SAMPSON:
take it in what sense thou wilt.
GREGORY:
They must take it in sense that feel it.
SAMPSON:
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
SAMPSON:
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
GREGORY:
'Tis well thou art not fish, if thou hadst, thou
GREGORY:
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
GREGORY:
two of the house of the Montagues.
SAMPSON:
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
GREGORY:
How! turn thy back and run?
SAMPSON:
Fear me not.
GREGORY:
No, marry, I fear thee!
SAMPSON:
Let us take the law of our sides, let them begin.
GREGORY:
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
GREGORY:
they list.
SAMPSON:
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them,
SAMPSON:
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
SAMPSON:
Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON:
I do bite my thumb, sir.
ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON:
[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say
SAMPSON:
ay?
GREGORY:
No.
SAMPSON:
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
SAMPSON:
bite my thumb, sir.
GREGORY:
Do you quarrel, sir?
ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
SAMPSON:
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
ABRAHAM:
No better.
SAMPSON:
Well, sir.
GREGORY:
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
SAMPSON:
Yes, better, sir.
ABRAHAM:
You lie.
SAMPSON:
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
SAMPSON:
They fight
SAMPSON:
Enter BENVOLIO
BENVOLIO:
Part, fools!
BENVOLIO:
Put up your swords, you know not what you do.
BENVOLIO:
Beats down their swords
BENVOLIO:
Enter TYBALT
TYBALT:
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
TYBALT:
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
BENVOLIO:
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
BENVOLIO:
Or manage it to part these men with me.
TYBALT:
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
TYBALT:
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee
TYBALT:
Have at thee, coward!
TYBALT:
They fight
TYBALT:
Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray, then enter Citizens, with clubs
First Citizen:
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
First Citizen:
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
First Citizen:
Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
CAPULET:
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
LADY CAPULET:
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
CAPULET:
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
CAPULET:
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
CAPULET:
Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
MONTAGUE:
Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
LADY MONTAGUE:
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
LADY MONTAGUE:
Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
PRINCE:
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
PRINCE:
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
PRINCE:
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
PRINCE:
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
PRINCE:
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
PRINCE:
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
PRINCE:
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
PRINCE:
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
PRINCE:
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
PRINCE:
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
PRINCE:
And made Verona's ancient citizens
PRINCE:
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
PRINCE:
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
PRINCE:
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate
PRINCE:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
PRINCE:
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
PRINCE:
For this time, all the rest depart away
PRINCE:
You Capulet, shall go along with me
PRINCE:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
PRINCE:
To know our further pleasure in this case,
PRINCE:
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
PRINCE:
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
PRINCE:
Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
MONTAGUE:
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
MONTAGUE:
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
BENVOLIO:
Here were the servants of your adversary,
BENVOLIO:
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach
BENVOLIO:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
BENVOLIO:
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
BENVOLIO:
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
BENVOLIO:
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
BENVOLIO:
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn
BENVOLIO:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
BENVOLIO:
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
BENVOLIO:
Till the prince came, who parted either part.
LADY MONTAGUE:
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
LADY MONTAGUE:
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
BENVOLIO:
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
BENVOLIO:
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
BENVOLIO:
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
BENVOLIO:
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
BENVOLIO:
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
BENVOLIO:
So early walking did I see your son
BENVOLIO:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
BENVOLIO:
And stole into the covert of the wood
BENVOLIO:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
BENVOLIO:
That most are busied when they're most alone,
BENVOLIO:
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
BENVOLIO:
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
MONTAGUE:
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
MONTAGUE:
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
MONTAGUE:
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs,
MONTAGUE:
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
MONTAGUE:
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
MONTAGUE:
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
MONTAGUE:
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
MONTAGUE:
And private in his chamber pens himself,
MONTAGUE:
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
MONTAGUE:
And makes himself an artificial night
MONTAGUE:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
MONTAGUE:
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
BENVOLIO:
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
MONTAGUE:
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
BENVOLIO:
Have you importuned him by any means?
MONTAGUE:
Both by myself and many other friends
MONTAGUE:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
MONTAGUE:
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
MONTAGUE:
But to himself so secret and so close,
MONTAGUE:
So far from sounding and discovery,
MONTAGUE:
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
MONTAGUE:
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
MONTAGUE:
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
MONTAGUE:
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
MONTAGUE:
We would as willingly give cure as know.
MONTAGUE:
Enter ROMEO
BENVOLIO:
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside,
BENVOLIO:
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
MONTAGUE:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
MONTAGUE:
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
MONTAGUE:
Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
BENVOLIO:
Good-morrow, cousin.
ROMEO:
Is the day so young?
BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine.
ROMEO:
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
ROMEO:
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
BENVOLIO:
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
ROMEO:
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
BENVOLIO:
In love?
ROMEO:
Out--
BENVOLIO:
Of love?
ROMEO:
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
BENVOLIO:
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
BENVOLIO:
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
ROMEO:
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
ROMEO:
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
ROMEO:
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
ROMEO:
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
ROMEO:
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
ROMEO:
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
ROMEO:
O any thing, of nothing first create!
ROMEO:
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
ROMEO:
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
ROMEO:
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
ROMEO:
sick health!
ROMEO:
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
ROMEO:
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
ROMEO:
Dost thou not laugh?
BENVOLIO:
No, coz, I rather weep.
ROMEO:
Good heart, at what?
BENVOLIO:
At thy good heart's oppression.
ROMEO:
Why, such is love's transgression.
ROMEO:
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
ROMEO:
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
ROMEO:
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
ROMEO:
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
ROMEO:
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs,
ROMEO:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes,
ROMEO:
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears
ROMEO:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
ROMEO:
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
ROMEO:
Farewell, my coz.
BENVOLIO:
Soft! I will go along,
BENVOLIO:
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
ROMEO:
Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here,
ROMEO:
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
BENVOLIO:
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
ROMEO:
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
BENVOLIO:
Groan! why, no.
BENVOLIO:
But sadly tell me who.
ROMEO:
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will
ROMEO:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
ROMEO:
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
ROMEO:
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
BENVOLIO:
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
ROMEO:
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
ROMEO:
With Cupid's arrow, she hath Dian's wit,
ROMEO:
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
ROMEO:
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
ROMEO:
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
ROMEO:
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
ROMEO:
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold
ROMEO:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
ROMEO:
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
BENVOLIO:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
ROMEO:
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
ROMEO:
For beauty starved with her severity
ROMEO:
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
ROMEO:
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
ROMEO:
To merit bliss by making me despair
ROMEO:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
ROMEO:
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
BENVOLIO:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
ROMEO:
O, teach me how I should forget to think.
BENVOLIO:
By giving liberty unto thine eyes,
BENVOLIO:
Examine other beauties.
ROMEO:
'Tis the way
ROMEO:
To call hers exquisite, in question more
ROMEO:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
ROMEO:
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair,
ROMEO:
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
ROMEO:
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost
ROMEO:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
ROMEO:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
ROMEO:
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
ROMEO:
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
BENVOLIO:
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
BENVOLIO:
Exeunt
BENVOLIO:
SCENE II. A street.
BENVOLIO:
Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
CAPULET:
But Montague is bound as well as I,
CAPULET:
In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard, I think,
CAPULET:
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
PARIS:
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
PARIS:
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
PARIS:
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
CAPULET:
But saying o'er what I have said before
CAPULET:
My child is yet a stranger in the world,
CAPULET:
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
CAPULET:
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
CAPULET:
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
PARIS:
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
CAPULET:
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
CAPULET:
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
CAPULET:
She is the hopeful lady of my earth
CAPULET:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
CAPULET:
My will to her consent is but a part,
CAPULET:
An she agree, within her scope of choice
CAPULET:
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
CAPULET:
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
CAPULET:
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
CAPULET:
Such as I love, and you, among the store,
CAPULET:
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
CAPULET:
At my poor house look to behold this night
CAPULET:
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light
CAPULET:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
CAPULET:
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
CAPULET:
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
CAPULET:
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
CAPULET:
Inherit at my house, hear all, all see,
CAPULET:
And like her most whose merit most shall be
CAPULET:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
CAPULET:
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
CAPULET:
Come, go with me.
CAPULET:
To Servant, giving a paper
CAPULET:
Go, sirrah, trudge about
CAPULET:
Through fair Verona, find those persons out
CAPULET:
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
CAPULET:
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
CAPULET:
Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
Servant:
Find them out whose names are written here! It is
Servant:
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
Servant:
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
Servant:
his pencil, and the painter with his nets, but I am
Servant:
sent to find those persons whose names are here
Servant:
writ, and can never find what names the writing
Servant:
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
Servant:
Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
BENVOLIO:
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
BENVOLIO:
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish,
BENVOLIO:
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning,
BENVOLIO:
One desperate grief cures with another's languish
BENVOLIO:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
BENVOLIO:
And the rank poison of the old will die.
ROMEO:
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
BENVOLIO:
For what, I pray thee?
ROMEO:
For your broken shin.
BENVOLIO:
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is,
ROMEO:
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
ROMEO:
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
Servant:
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
ROMEO:
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Servant:
Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
Servant:
pray, can you read any thing you see?
ROMEO:
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
Servant:
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
ROMEO:
Stay, fellow, I can read.
ROMEO:
Reads
ROMEO:
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters,
ROMEO:
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters, the lady
ROMEO:
widow of Vitravio, Signior Placentio and his lovely
ROMEO:
nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, mine
ROMEO:
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters, my fair niece
ROMEO:
Rosaline, Livia, Signior Valentio and his cousin
ROMEO:
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
ROMEO:
assembly: whither should they come?
Servant:
Up.
ROMEO:
Whither?
Servant:
To supper, to our house.
ROMEO:
Whose house?
Servant:
My master's.
ROMEO:
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
Servant:
Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
Servant:
great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house
Servant:
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Servant:
Rest you merry!
Servant:
Exit
BENVOLIO:
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
BENVOLIO:
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
BENVOLIO:
With all the admired beauties of Verona
BENVOLIO:
Go thither, and, with unattainted eye,
BENVOLIO:
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
BENVOLIO:
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
ROMEO:
When the devout religion of mine eye
ROMEO:
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires,
ROMEO:
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
ROMEO:
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
ROMEO:
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
ROMEO:
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
BENVOLIO:
Herself poised with herself in either eye
BENVOLIO:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
BENVOLIO:
Your lady's love against some other maid
BENVOLIO:
That I will show you shining at this feast,
BENVOLIO:
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
ROMEO:
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
ROMEO:
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
ROMEO:
Exeunt
ROMEO:
SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
ROMEO:
Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
Nurse:
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
Nurse:
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
Nurse:
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
Nurse:
Enter JULIET
JULIET:
How now! who calls?
Nurse:
Your mother.
JULIET:
Madam, I am here.
JULIET:
What is your will?
LADY CAPULET:
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
LADY CAPULET:
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again,
LADY CAPULET:
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
LADY CAPULET:
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Nurse:
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
LADY CAPULET:
She's not fourteen.
Nurse:
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
Nurse:
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
Nurse:
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
Nurse:
To Lammas-tide?
LADY CAPULET:
A fortnight and odd days.
Nurse:
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Nurse:
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Nurse:
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Nurse:
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God,
Nurse:
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
Nurse:
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen,
Nurse:
That shall she, marry, I remember it well.
Nurse:
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,
Nurse:
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Nurse:
Of all the days of the year, upon that day
Nurse:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Nurse:
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall,
Nurse:
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nurse:
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
Nurse:
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Nurse:
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
Nurse:
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Nurse:
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
Nurse:
To bid me trudge
Nurse:
And since that time it is eleven years,
Nurse:
For then she could stand alone, nay, by the rood,
Nurse:
She could have run and waddled all about,
Nurse:
For even the day before, she broke her brow
Nurse:
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
Nurse:
A' was a merry man--took up the child
Nurse:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Nurse:
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,
Nurse:
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
Nurse:
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
Nurse:
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
Nurse:
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
Nurse:
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
Nurse:
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
LADY CAPULET:
Enough of this, I pray thee, hold thy peace.
Nurse:
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
Nurse:
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
Nurse:
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
Nurse:
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone,
Nurse:
A parlous knock, and it cried bitterly
Nurse:
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Nurse:
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,
Nurse:
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
JULIET:
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
Nurse:
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Nurse:
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed
Nurse:
An I might live to see thee married once,
Nurse:
I have my wish.
LADY CAPULET:
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
LADY CAPULET:
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
LADY CAPULET:
How stands your disposition to be married?
JULIET:
It is an honour that I dream not of.
Nurse:
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
Nurse:
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
LADY CAPULET:
Well, think of marriage now, younger than you,
LADY CAPULET:
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
LADY CAPULET:
Are made already mothers: by my count,
LADY CAPULET:
I was your mother much upon these years
LADY CAPULET:
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief
LADY CAPULET:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Nurse:
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
Nurse:
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nurse:
Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.
LADY CAPULET:
What say you? can you love the gentleman?
LADY CAPULET:
This night you shall behold him at our feast,
LADY CAPULET:
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
LADY CAPULET:
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen,
LADY CAPULET:
Examine every married lineament,
LADY CAPULET:
And see how one another lends content
LADY CAPULET:
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
LADY CAPULET:
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
LADY CAPULET:
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
LADY CAPULET:
To beautify him, only lacks a cover
LADY CAPULET:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
LADY CAPULET:
For fair without the fair within to hide
LADY CAPULET:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
LADY CAPULET:
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story,
LADY CAPULET:
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
LADY CAPULET:
By having him, making yourself no less.
Nurse:
No less! nay, bigger, women grow by men.
LADY CAPULET:
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
JULIET:
I'll look to like, if looking liking move
JULIET:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
JULIET:
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
JULIET:
Enter a Servant
Servant:
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
Servant:
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
Servant:
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
Servant:
hence to wait, I beseech you, follow straight.
LADY CAPULET:
We follow thee.
LADY CAPULET:
Exit Servant
LADY CAPULET:
Juliet, the county stays.
Nurse:
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Nurse:
Exeunt
Nurse:
SCENE IV. A street.
Nurse:
Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
ROMEO:
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
ROMEO:
Or shall we on without a apology?
BENVOLIO:
The date is out of such prolixity
BENVOLIO:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
BENVOLIO:
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
BENVOLIO:
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper,
BENVOLIO:
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
BENVOLIO:
After the prompter, for our entrance
BENVOLIO:
But let them measure us by what they will,
BENVOLIO:
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling,
ROMEO:
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
MERCUTIO:
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
ROMEO:
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
ROMEO:
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
ROMEO:
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
MERCUTIO:
You are a lover, borrow Cupid's wings,
MERCUTIO:
And soar with them above a common bound.
ROMEO:
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
ROMEO:
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
ROMEO:
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
ROMEO:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
MERCUTIO:
And, to sink in it, should you burden love,
MERCUTIO:
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
ROMEO:
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
MERCUTIO:
If love be rough with you, be rough with love,
MERCUTIO:
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
MERCUTIO:
Give me a case to put my visage in
MERCUTIO:
A visor for a visor! what care I
MERCUTIO:
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
MERCUTIO:
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
BENVOLIO:
Come, knock and enter, and no sooner in,
BENVOLIO:
But every man betake him to his legs.
ROMEO:
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
ROMEO:
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
ROMEO:
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
ROMEO:
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
ROMEO:
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
MERCUTIO:
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word
MERCUTIO:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
MERCUTIO:
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
MERCUTIO:
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
ROMEO:
Nay, that's not so.
MERCUTIO:
I mean, sir, in delay
MERCUTIO:
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
MERCUTIO:
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
MERCUTIO:
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
ROMEO:
And we mean well in going to this mask,
ROMEO:
But 'tis no wit to go.
MERCUTIO:
Why, may one ask?
ROMEO:
I dream'd a dream to-night.
MERCUTIO:
And so did I.
ROMEO:
Well, what was yours?
MERCUTIO:
That dreamers often lie.
ROMEO:
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
MERCUTIO:
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
MERCUTIO:
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
MERCUTIO:
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
MERCUTIO:
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
MERCUTIO:
Drawn with a team of little atomies
MERCUTIO:
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep,
MERCUTIO:
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
MERCUTIO:
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
MERCUTIO:
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
MERCUTIO:
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
MERCUTIO:
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
MERCUTIO:
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
MERCUTIO:
Not so big as a round little worm
MERCUTIO:
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid,
MERCUTIO:
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
MERCUTIO:
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
MERCUTIO:
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
MERCUTIO:
And in this state she gallops night by night
MERCUTIO:
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love,
MERCUTIO:
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
MERCUTIO:
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
MERCUTIO:
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
MERCUTIO:
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
MERCUTIO:
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
MERCUTIO:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
MERCUTIO:
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit,
MERCUTIO:
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
MERCUTIO:
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
MERCUTIO:
Then dreams, he of another benefice
MERCUTIO:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
MERCUTIO:
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
MERCUTIO:
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
MERCUTIO:
Of healths five-fathom deep, and then anon
MERCUTIO:
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
MERCUTIO:
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
MERCUTIO:
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
MERCUTIO:
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
MERCUTIO:
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
MERCUTIO:
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes
MERCUTIO:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
MERCUTIO:
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
MERCUTIO:
Making them women of good carriage
MERCUTIO:
This is she--
ROMEO:
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
ROMEO:
Thou talk'st of nothing.
MERCUTIO:
True, I talk of dreams,
MERCUTIO:
Which are the children of an idle brain,
MERCUTIO:
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
MERCUTIO:
Which is as thin of substance as the air
MERCUTIO:
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
MERCUTIO:
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
MERCUTIO:
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
MERCUTIO:
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
BENVOLIO:
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves,
BENVOLIO:
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
ROMEO:
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
ROMEO:
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
ROMEO:
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
ROMEO:
With this night's revels and expire the term
ROMEO:
Of a despised life closed in my breast
ROMEO:
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
ROMEO:
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
ROMEO:
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
BENVOLIO:
Strike, drum.
BENVOLIO:
Exeunt
BENVOLIO:
SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
BENVOLIO:
Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
First Servant:
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
First Servant:
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
Second Servant:
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
Second Servant:
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
First Servant:
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
First Servant:
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
First Servant:
me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou lovest me, let
First Servant:
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
First Servant:
Antony, and Potpan!
Second Servant:
Ay, boy, ready.
First Servant:
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
First Servant:
sought for, in the great chamber.
Second Servant:
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys, be
Second Servant:
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
Second Servant:
Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
CAPULET:
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
CAPULET:
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
CAPULET:
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
CAPULET:
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
CAPULET:
She, I'll swear, hath corns, am I come near ye now?
CAPULET:
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
CAPULET:
That I have worn a visor and could tell
CAPULET:
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
CAPULET:
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone
CAPULET:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
CAPULET:
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
CAPULET:
Music plays, and they dance
CAPULET:
More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up,
CAPULET:
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
CAPULET:
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
CAPULET:
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
CAPULET:
For you and I are past our dancing days
CAPULET:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
CAPULET:
Were in a mask?
Second Capulet:
By'r lady, thirty years.
CAPULET:
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much
CAPULET:
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
CAPULET:
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
CAPULET:
Some five and twenty years, and then we mask'd.
Second Capulet:
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir,
Second Capulet:
His son is thirty.
CAPULET:
Will you tell me that?
CAPULET:
His son was but a ward two years ago.
ROMEO:
[To a Servingman]  What lady is that, which doth
ROMEO:
enrich the hand
ROMEO:
Of yonder knight?
Servant:
I know not, sir.
ROMEO:
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
ROMEO:
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
ROMEO:
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear,
ROMEO:
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
ROMEO:
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
ROMEO:
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
ROMEO:
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
ROMEO:
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
ROMEO:
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
ROMEO:
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
TYBALT:
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
TYBALT:
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
TYBALT:
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
TYBALT:
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
TYBALT:
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
TYBALT:
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
CAPULET:
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT:
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
TYBALT:
A villain that is hither come in spite,
TYBALT:
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
CAPULET:
Young Romeo is it?
TYBALT:
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
CAPULET:
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
CAPULET:
He bears him like a portly gentleman,
CAPULET:
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
CAPULET:
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth
CAPULET:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
CAPULET:
Here in my house do him disparagement
CAPULET:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him
CAPULET:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
CAPULET:
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
CAPULET:
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
TYBALT:
It fits, when such a villain is a guest
TYBALT:
I'll not endure him.
CAPULET:
He shall be endured
CAPULET:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to,
CAPULET:
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
CAPULET:
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
CAPULET:
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
CAPULET:
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
TYBALT:
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
CAPULET:
Go to, go to,
CAPULET:
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
CAPULET:
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what
CAPULET:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
CAPULET:
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox, go
CAPULET:
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
CAPULET:
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
TYBALT:
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
TYBALT:
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
TYBALT:
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
TYBALT:
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
TYBALT:
Exit
ROMEO:
[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand
ROMEO:
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this
ROMEO:
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
ROMEO:
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
JULIET:
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
JULIET:
Which mannerly devotion shows in this,
JULIET:
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
JULIET:
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
ROMEO:
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JULIET:
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
ROMEO:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do,
ROMEO:
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
JULIET:
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
ROMEO:
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
ROMEO:
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
JULIET:
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
ROMEO:
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
ROMEO:
Give me my sin again.
JULIET:
You kiss by the book.
Nurse:
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
ROMEO:
What is her mother?
Nurse:
Marry, bachelor,
Nurse:
Her mother is the lady of the house,
Nurse:
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
Nurse:
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal,
Nurse:
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Nurse:
Shall have the chinks.
ROMEO:
Is she a Capulet?
ROMEO:
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
BENVOLIO:
Away, begone, the sport is at the best.
ROMEO:
Ay, so I fear, the more is my unrest.
CAPULET:
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
CAPULET:
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
CAPULET:
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
CAPULET:
I thank you, honest gentlemen, good night.
CAPULET:
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
CAPULET:
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late
CAPULET:
I'll to my rest.
CAPULET:
Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
JULIET:
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
Nurse:
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
JULIET:
What's he that now is going out of door?
Nurse:
Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
JULIET:
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
Nurse:
I know not.
JULIET:
Go ask his name: if he be married.
JULIET:
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
Nurse:
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
Nurse:
The only son of your great enemy.
JULIET:
My only love sprung from my only hate!
JULIET:
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
JULIET:
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
JULIET:
That I must love a loathed enemy.
Nurse:
What's this? what's this?
JULIET:
A rhyme I learn'd even now
JULIET:
Of one I danced withal.
JULIET:
One calls within 'Juliet.'
Nurse:
Anon, anon!
Nurse:
Come, let's away, the strangers all are gone.
Nurse:
Exeunt

ACT II
Nurse:
PROLOGUE
Nurse:
Enter Chorus
Chorus:
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
Chorus:
And young affection gapes to be his heir,
Chorus:
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
Chorus:
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Chorus:
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Chorus:
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
Chorus:
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
Chorus:
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks
Chorus:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
Chorus:
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
Chorus:
And she as much in love, her means much less
Chorus:
To meet her new-beloved any where
Chorus:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Chorus:
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
Chorus:
Exit
Chorus:
SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
Chorus:
Enter ROMEO
ROMEO:
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
ROMEO:
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
ROMEO:
He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
ROMEO:
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
BENVOLIO:
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
MERCUTIO:
He is wise,
MERCUTIO:
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
BENVOLIO:
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall
BENVOLIO:
Call, good Mercutio.
MERCUTIO:
Nay, I'll conjure too.
MERCUTIO:
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
MERCUTIO:
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
MERCUTIO:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied,
MERCUTIO:
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove,'
MERCUTIO:
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
MERCUTIO:
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
MERCUTIO:
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
MERCUTIO:
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
MERCUTIO:
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not,
MERCUTIO:
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
MERCUTIO:
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
MERCUTIO:
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
MERCUTIO:
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
MERCUTIO:
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
MERCUTIO:
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
BENVOLIO:
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
MERCUTIO:
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
MERCUTIO:
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
MERCUTIO:
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
MERCUTIO:
Till she had laid it and conjured it down,
MERCUTIO:
That were some spite: my invocation
MERCUTIO:
Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
MERCUTIO:
I conjure only but to raise up him.
BENVOLIO:
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
BENVOLIO:
To be consorted with the humorous night
BENVOLIO:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
MERCUTIO:
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
MERCUTIO:
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
MERCUTIO:
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
MERCUTIO:
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
MERCUTIO:
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
MERCUTIO:
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
MERCUTIO:
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed,
MERCUTIO:
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep
MERCUTIO:
Come, shall we go?
BENVOLIO:
Go, then, for 'tis in vain
BENVOLIO:
To seek him here that means not to be found.
BENVOLIO:
Exeunt
BENVOLIO:
SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
BENVOLIO:
Enter ROMEO
ROMEO:
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
ROMEO:
JULIET appears above at a window
ROMEO:
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
ROMEO:
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
ROMEO:
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
ROMEO:
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
ROMEO:
That thou her maid art far more fair than she
ROMEO:
Be not her maid, since she is envious,
ROMEO:
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
ROMEO:
And none but fools do wear it, cast it off.
ROMEO:
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
ROMEO:
O, that she knew she were!
ROMEO:
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
ROMEO:
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.
ROMEO:
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks
ROMEO:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
ROMEO:
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
ROMEO:
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
ROMEO:
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
ROMEO:
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
ROMEO:
As daylight doth a lamp, her eyes in heaven
ROMEO:
Would through the airy region stream so bright
ROMEO:
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
ROMEO:
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
ROMEO:
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
ROMEO:
That I might touch that cheek!
JULIET:
Ay me!
ROMEO:
She speaks
ROMEO:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
ROMEO:
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
ROMEO:
As is a winged messenger of heaven
ROMEO:
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
ROMEO:
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
ROMEO:
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
ROMEO:
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
JULIET:
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
JULIET:
Deny thy father and refuse thy name,
JULIET:
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
JULIET:
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
ROMEO:
[Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
JULIET:
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy,
JULIET:
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
JULIET:
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
JULIET:
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
JULIET:
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
JULIET:
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
JULIET:
By any other name would smell as sweet,
JULIET:
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
JULIET:
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
JULIET:
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
JULIET:
And for that name which is no part of thee
JULIET:
Take all myself.
ROMEO:
I take thee at thy word
ROMEO:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized,
ROMEO:
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
JULIET:
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
JULIET:
So stumblest on my counsel?
ROMEO:
By a name
ROMEO:
I know not how to tell thee who I am
ROMEO:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
ROMEO:
Because it is an enemy to thee,
ROMEO:
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JULIET:
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
JULIET:
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound
JULIET:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
ROMEO:
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
JULIET:
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
JULIET:
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
JULIET:
And the place death, considering who thou art,
JULIET:
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
ROMEO:
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls,
ROMEO:
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
ROMEO:
And what love can do that dares love attempt,
ROMEO:
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
JULIET:
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
ROMEO:
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
ROMEO:
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
ROMEO:
And I am proof against their enmity.
JULIET:
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
ROMEO:
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight,
ROMEO:
And but thou love me, let them find me here
ROMEO:
My life were better ended by their hate,
ROMEO:
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
JULIET:
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
ROMEO:
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire,
ROMEO:
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
ROMEO:
I am no pilot, yet, wert thou as far
ROMEO:
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
ROMEO:
I would adventure for such merchandise.
JULIET:
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
JULIET:
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
JULIET:
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
JULIET:
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
JULIET:
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
JULIET:
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
JULIET:
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
JULIET:
Thou mayst prove false, at lovers' perjuries
JULIET:
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
JULIET:
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully
JULIET:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
JULIET:
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
JULIET:
So thou wilt woo, but else, not for the world.
JULIET:
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
JULIET:
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light
JULIET:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
JULIET:
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
JULIET:
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
JULIET:
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
JULIET:
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
JULIET:
And not impute this yielding to light love,
JULIET:
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
ROMEO:
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
ROMEO:
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
JULIET:
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
JULIET:
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
JULIET:
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
ROMEO:
What shall I swear by?
JULIET:
Do not swear at all,
JULIET:
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
JULIET:
Which is the god of my idolatry,
JULIET:
And I'll believe thee.
ROMEO:
If my heart's dear love--
JULIET:
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
JULIET:
I have no joy of this contract to-night
JULIET:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,
JULIET:
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
JULIET:
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
JULIET:
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
JULIET:
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
JULIET:
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
JULIET:
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
ROMEO:
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
JULIET:
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
ROMEO:
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
JULIET:
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
JULIET:
And yet I would it were to give again.
ROMEO:
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
JULIET:
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
JULIET:
And yet I wish but for the thing I have
JULIET:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
JULIET:
My love as deep, the more I give to thee,
JULIET:
The more I have, for both are infinite.
JULIET:
Nurse calls within
JULIET:
I hear some noise within, dear love, adieu!
JULIET:
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
JULIET:
Stay but a little, I will come again.
JULIET:
Exit, above
ROMEO:
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
ROMEO:
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
ROMEO:
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
ROMEO:
Re-enter JULIET, above
JULIET:
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
JULIET:
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
JULIET:
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
JULIET:
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
JULIET:
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
JULIET:
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
JULIET:
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
Nurse:
[Within]  Madam!
JULIET:
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
JULIET:
I do beseech thee--
Nurse:
[Within]  Madam!
JULIET:
By and by, I come:--
JULIET:
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief
JULIET:
To-morrow will I send.
ROMEO:
So thrive my soul--
JULIET:
A thousand times good night!
JULIET:
Exit, above
ROMEO:
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
ROMEO:
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
ROMEO:
their books,
ROMEO:
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
ROMEO:
Retiring
ROMEO:
Re-enter JULIET, above
JULIET:
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
JULIET:
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
JULIET:
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud,
JULIET:
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
JULIET:
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
JULIET:
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
ROMEO:
It is my soul that calls upon my name
ROMEO:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
ROMEO:
Like softest music to attending ears!
JULIET:
Romeo!
ROMEO:
My dear?
JULIET:
At what o'clock to-morrow
JULIET:
Shall I send to thee?
ROMEO:
At the hour of nine.
JULIET:
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
JULIET:
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
ROMEO:
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
JULIET:
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
JULIET:
Remembering how I love thy company.
ROMEO:
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
ROMEO:
Forgetting any other home but this.
JULIET:
'Tis almost morning, I would have thee gone
JULIET:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird,
JULIET:
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
JULIET:
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
JULIET:
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
JULIET:
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
ROMEO:
I would I were thy bird.
JULIET:
Sweet, so would I
JULIET:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
JULIET:
Good night, good night! parting is such
JULIET:
sweet sorrow,
JULIET:
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
JULIET:
Exit above
ROMEO:
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
ROMEO:
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
ROMEO:
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
ROMEO:
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
ROMEO:
Exit
ROMEO:
SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
ROMEO:
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
FRIAR LAURENCE:
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
FRIAR LAURENCE:
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And from her womb children of divers kind
FRIAR LAURENCE:
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Many for many virtues excellent,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
None but for some and yet all different.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
FRIAR LAURENCE:
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But to the earth some special good doth give,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Within the infant rind of this small flower
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Poison hath residence and medicine power
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
FRIAR LAURENCE:
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And where the worser is predominant,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Enter ROMEO
ROMEO:
Good morrow, father.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Benedicite!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
FRIAR LAURENCE:
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
ROMEO:
That last is true, the sweeter rest was mine.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
ROMEO:
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no,
ROMEO:
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
ROMEO:
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
ROMEO:
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
ROMEO:
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
ROMEO:
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
ROMEO:
Within thy help and holy physic lies
ROMEO:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
ROMEO:
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
ROMEO:
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
ROMEO:
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
ROMEO:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
ROMEO:
And all combined, save what thou must combine
ROMEO:
By holy marriage: when and where and how
ROMEO:
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
ROMEO:
I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,
ROMEO:
That thou consent to marry us to-day.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet
FRIAR LAURENCE:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
ROMEO:
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
ROMEO:
And bad'st me bury love.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not in a grave,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To lay one in, another out to have.
ROMEO:
I pray thee, chide not, she whom I love now
ROMEO:
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow,
ROMEO:
The other did not so.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, she knew well
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
In one respect I'll thy assistant be,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For this alliance may so happy prove,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
ROMEO:
O, let us hence, I stand on sudden haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely and slow, they stumble that run fast.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Exeunt
FRIAR LAURENCE:
SCENE IV. A street.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
MERCUTIO:
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
MERCUTIO:
Came he not home to-night?
BENVOLIO:
Not to his father's, I spoke with his man.
MERCUTIO:
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
MERCUTIO:
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
BENVOLIO:
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
MERCUTIO:
A challenge, on my life.
BENVOLIO:
Romeo will answer it.
MERCUTIO:
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
BENVOLIO:
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
BENVOLIO:
dares, being dared.
MERCUTIO:
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead, stabbed with a
MERCUTIO:
white wench's black eye, shot through the ear with a
MERCUTIO:
love-song, the very pin of his heart cleft with the
MERCUTIO:
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
MERCUTIO:
encounter Tybalt?
BENVOLIO:
Why, what is Tybalt?
MERCUTIO:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
MERCUTIO:
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
MERCUTIO:
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
MERCUTIO:
proportion, rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
MERCUTIO:
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
MERCUTIO:
button, a duellist, a duellist, a gentleman of the
MERCUTIO:
very first house, of the first and second cause
MERCUTIO:
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
MERCUTIO:
hai!
BENVOLIO:
The what?
MERCUTIO:
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
MERCUTIO:
fantasticoes, these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
MERCUTIO:
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
MERCUTIO:
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
MERCUTIO:
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
MERCUTIO:
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
MERCUTIO:
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
MERCUTIO:
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
MERCUTIO:
bones, their bones!
MERCUTIO:
Enter ROMEO
BENVOLIO:
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
MERCUTIO:
Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
MERCUTIO:
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
MERCUTIO:
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
MERCUTIO:
kitchen-wench, marry, she had a better love to
MERCUTIO:
be-rhyme her, Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gipsy,
MERCUTIO:
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, Thisbe a grey
MERCUTIO:
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
MERCUTIO:
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
MERCUTIO:
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
MERCUTIO:
fairly last night.
ROMEO:
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the slip, can you not conceive?
ROMEO:
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in
ROMEO:
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
MERCUTIO:
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
MERCUTIO:
constrains a man to bow in the hams.
ROMEO:
Meaning, to court'sy.
MERCUTIO:
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
ROMEO:
A most courteous exposition.
MERCUTIO:
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
ROMEO:
Pink for flower.
MERCUTIO:
Right.
ROMEO:
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
MERCUTIO:
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
MERCUTIO:
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
MERCUTIO:
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
ROMEO:
singleness.
MERCUTIO:
Come between us, good Benvolio, my wits faint.
ROMEO:
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry a match.
MERCUTIO:
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
MERCUTIO:
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
MERCUTIO:
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five
MERCUTIO:
was I with you there for the goose?
ROMEO:
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
ROMEO:
not there for the goose.
MERCUTIO:
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
ROMEO:
Nay, good goose, bite not.
MERCUTIO:
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most
MERCUTIO:
sharp sauce.
ROMEO:
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
MERCUTIO:
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
MERCUTIO:
inch narrow to an ell broad!
ROMEO:
I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which added
ROMEO:
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
MERCUTIO:
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
MERCUTIO:
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo, now art
MERCUTIO:
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature
MERCUTIO:
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
MERCUTIO:
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.
MERCUTIO:
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
BENVOLIO:
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
MERCUTIO:
O, thou art deceived, I would have made it short
MERCUTIO:
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and
MERCUTIO:
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
ROMEO:
Here's goodly gear!
ROMEO:
Enter Nurse and PETER
MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!
BENVOLIO:
Two, two, a shirt and a smock.
Nurse:
Peter!
PETER:
Anon!
Nurse:
My fan, Peter.
MERCUTIO:
Good Peter, to hide her face, for her fan's the
MERCUTIO:
fairer face.
Nurse:
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
MERCUTIO:
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
Nurse:
Is it good den?
MERCUTIO:
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
MERCUTIO:
dial is now upon the prick of noon.
Nurse:
Out upon you! what a man are you!
ROMEO:
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
ROMEO:
mar.
Nurse:
By my troth, it is well said, 'for himself to mar,'
Nurse:
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
Nurse:
may find the young Romeo?
ROMEO:
I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when
ROMEO:
you have found him than he was when you sought him
ROMEO:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
Nurse:
You say well.
MERCUTIO:
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith,
MERCUTIO:
wisely, wisely.
Nurse:
if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
Nurse:
you.
BENVOLIO:
She will indite him to some supper.
MERCUTIO:
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
ROMEO:
What hast thou found?
MERCUTIO:
No hare, sir, unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
MERCUTIO:
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
MERCUTIO:
Sings
MERCUTIO:
An old hare hoar,
MERCUTIO:
And an old hare hoar,
MERCUTIO:
Is very good meat in lent
MERCUTIO:
But a hare that is hoar
MERCUTIO:
Is too much for a score,
MERCUTIO:
When it hoars ere it be spent.
MERCUTIO:
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
MERCUTIO:
to dinner, thither.
ROMEO:
I will follow you.
MERCUTIO:
Farewell, ancient lady, farewell,
MERCUTIO:
Singing
MERCUTIO:
'lady, lady, lady.'
MERCUTIO:
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
Nurse:
Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
Nurse:
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
ROMEO:
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
ROMEO:
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
ROMEO:
to in a month.
Nurse:
An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
Nurse:
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
Nurse:
Jacks, and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
Nurse:
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills, I am
Nurse:
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
Nurse:
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
PETER:
I saw no man use you a pleasure, if I had, my weapon
PETER:
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
PETER:
draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
PETER:
good quarrel, and the law on my side.
Nurse:
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
Nurse:
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word
Nurse:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
Nurse:
out, what she bade me say, I will keep to myself
Nurse:
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
Nurse:
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
Nurse:
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
Nurse:
is young, and, therefore, if you should deal double
Nurse:
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
Nurse:
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
ROMEO:
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
ROMEO:
protest unto thee--
Nurse:
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much
Nurse:
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
ROMEO:
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
Nurse:
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as
Nurse:
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
ROMEO:
Bid her devise
ROMEO:
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
ROMEO:
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
ROMEO:
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
Nurse:
No truly sir, not a penny.
ROMEO:
Go to, I say you shall.
Nurse:
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
ROMEO:
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall
ROMEO:
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
ROMEO:
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
ROMEO:
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
ROMEO:
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
ROMEO:
Farewell, be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains
ROMEO:
Farewell, commend me to thy mistress.
Nurse:
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
ROMEO:
What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
Nurse:
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Nurse:
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
ROMEO:
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
NURSE:
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
NURSE:
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
NURSE:
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
NURSE:
lay knife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief
NURSE:
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
NURSE:
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
NURSE:
man, but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
NURSE:
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
NURSE:
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
ROMEO:
Ay, nurse, what of that? both with an R.
Nurse:
Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name, R is for
Nurse:
the--No, I know it begins with some other
Nurse:
letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
Nurse:
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
Nurse:
to hear it.
ROMEO:
Commend me to thy lady.
Nurse:
Ay, a thousand times.
Nurse:
Exit Romeo
Nurse:
Peter!
PETER:
Anon!
Nurse:
Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
Nurse:
Exeunt
Nurse:
SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
Nurse:
Enter JULIET
JULIET:
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse,
JULIET:
In half an hour she promised to return.
JULIET:
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
JULIET:
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
JULIET:
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
JULIET:
Driving back shadows over louring hills
JULIET:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
JULIET:
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
JULIET:
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
JULIET:
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
JULIET:
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
JULIET:
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
JULIET:
She would be as swift in motion as a ball,
JULIET:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
JULIET:
And his to me
JULIET:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead,
JULIET:
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
JULIET:
O God, she comes!
JULIET:
Enter Nurse and PETER
JULIET:
O honey nurse, what news?
JULIET:
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
Nurse:
Peter, stay at the gate.
Nurse:
Exit PETER
JULIET:
Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
JULIET:
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily,
JULIET:
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
JULIET:
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
Nurse:
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile
Nurse:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
JULIET:
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news
JULIET:
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak, good, good nurse, speak.
Nurse:
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Nurse:
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
JULIET:
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
JULIET:
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
JULIET:
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
JULIET:
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
JULIET:
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that,
JULIET:
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance
JULIET:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
Nurse:
Well, you have made a simple choice, you know not
Nurse:
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he, though his
Nurse:
face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
Nurse:
all men's, and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Nurse:
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
Nurse:
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
Nurse:
but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
Nurse:
ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?
JULIET:
No, no: but all this did I know before.
JULIET:
What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Nurse:
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
Nurse:
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
Nurse:
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
Nurse:
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
Nurse:
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
JULIET:
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
JULIET:
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
Nurse:
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
Nurse:
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
JULIET:
Where is my mother! why, she is within,
JULIET:
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
JULIET:
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
JULIET:
Where is your mother?'
Nurse:
O God's lady dear!
Nurse:
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow,
Nurse:
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Nurse:
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
JULIET:
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
Nurse:
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
JULIET:
I have.
Nurse:
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell,
Nurse:
There stays a husband to make you a wife
Nurse:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
Nurse:
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Nurse:
Hie you to church, I must another way,
Nurse:
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Nurse:
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark
Nurse:
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
Nurse:
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Nurse:
Go, I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
JULIET:
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
JULIET:
Exeunt
JULIET:
SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
JULIET:
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
FRIAR LAURENCE:
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
ROMEO:
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
ROMEO:
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
ROMEO:
That one short minute gives me in her sight
ROMEO:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
ROMEO:
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
ROMEO:
It is enough I may but call her mine.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
These violent delights have violent ends
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And in the taste confounds the appetite
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Therefore love moderately, long love doth so,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Enter JULIET
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint
FRIAR LAURENCE:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
FRIAR LAURENCE:
That idles in the wanton summer air,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And yet not fall, so light is vanity.
JULIET:
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
JULIET:
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
ROMEO:
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
ROMEO:
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
ROMEO:
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
ROMEO:
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
ROMEO:
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
JULIET:
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
JULIET:
Brags of his substance, not of ornament
JULIET:
They are but beggars that can count their worth,
JULIET:
But my true love is grown to such excess
JULIET:
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Till holy church incorporate two in one.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Exeunt
FRIAR LAURENCE:
ACT III
FRIAR LAURENCE:
SCENE I. A public place.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
BENVOLIO:
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire
BENVOLIO:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
BENVOLIO:
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
BENVOLIO:
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
MERCUTIO:
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
MERCUTIO:
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
MERCUTIO:
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
MERCUTIO:
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
MERCUTIO:
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
BENVOLIO:
Am I like such a fellow?
MERCUTIO:
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
MERCUTIO:
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
MERCUTIO:
soon moody to be moved.
BENVOLIO:
And what to?
MERCUTIO:
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
MERCUTIO:
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
MERCUTIO:
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
MERCUTIO:
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
MERCUTIO:
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
MERCUTIO:
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
MERCUTIO:
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
MERCUTIO:
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
MERCUTIO:
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
MERCUTIO:
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
MERCUTIO:
man for coughing in the street, because he hath
MERCUTIO:
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
MERCUTIO:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
MERCUTIO:
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
MERCUTIO:
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
MERCUTIO:
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
BENVOLIO:
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
BENVOLIO:
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
MERCUTIO:
The fee-simple! O simple!
BENVOLIO:
By my head, here come the Capulets.
MERCUTIO:
By my heel, I care not.
MERCUTIO:
Enter TYBALT and others
TYBALT:
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
TYBALT:
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
MERCUTIO:
And but one word with one of us? couple it with
MERCUTIO:
something, make it a word and a blow.
TYBALT:
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
TYBALT:
will give me occasion.
MERCUTIO:
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
TYBALT:
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
MERCUTIO:
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
MERCUTIO:
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
MERCUTIO:
discords: here's my fiddlestick, here's that shall
MERCUTIO:
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the public haunt of men
BENVOLIO:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
BENVOLIO:
And reason coldly of your grievances,
BENVOLIO:
Or else depart, here all eyes gaze on us.
MERCUTIO:
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze,
MERCUTIO:
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
MERCUTIO:
Enter ROMEO
TYBALT:
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
MERCUTIO:
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery
MERCUTIO:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower,
MERCUTIO:
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
TYBALT:
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
TYBALT:
No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
ROMEO:
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
ROMEO:
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
ROMEO:
To such a greeting: villain am I none,
ROMEO:
Therefore farewell, I see thou know'st me not.
TYBALT:
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
TYBALT:
That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.
ROMEO:
I do protest, I never injured thee,
ROMEO:
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
ROMEO:
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love
ROMEO:
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
ROMEO:
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
MERCUTIO:
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
MERCUTIO:
Alla stoccata carries it away.
MERCUTIO:
Draws
MERCUTIO:
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
TYBALT:
What wouldst thou have with me?
MERCUTIO:
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
MERCUTIO:
lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
MERCUTIO:
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
MERCUTIO:
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
MERCUTIO:
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
MERCUTIO:
ears ere it be out.
TYBALT:
I am for you.
TYBALT:
Drawing
ROMEO:
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
MERCUTIO:
Come, sir, your passado.
MERCUTIO:
They fight
ROMEO:
Draw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons.
ROMEO:
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
ROMEO:
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
ROMEO:
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets
ROMEO:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
ROMEO:
TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
MERCUTIO:
I am hurt.
MERCUTIO:
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
MERCUTIO:
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
BENVOLIO:
What, art thou hurt?
MERCUTIO:
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch, marry, 'tis enough.
MERCUTIO:
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
MERCUTIO:
Exit Page
ROMEO:
Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.
MERCUTIO:
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
MERCUTIO:
church-door, but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
MERCUTIO:
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
MERCUTIO:
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
MERCUTIO:
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
MERCUTIO:
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
MERCUTIO:
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
MERCUTIO:
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
MERCUTIO:
was hurt under your arm.
ROMEO:
I thought all for the best.
MERCUTIO:
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
MERCUTIO:
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
MERCUTIO:
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
MERCUTIO:
And soundly too: your houses!
MERCUTIO:
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
ROMEO:
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
ROMEO:
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
ROMEO:
In my behalf, my reputation stain'd
ROMEO:
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
ROMEO:
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
ROMEO:
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
ROMEO:
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
ROMEO:
Re-enter BENVOLIO
BENVOLIO:
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
BENVOLIO:
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
BENVOLIO:
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
ROMEO:
This day's black fate on more days doth depend,
ROMEO:
This but begins the woe, others must end.
BENVOLIO:
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
ROMEO:
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
ROMEO:
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
ROMEO:
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
ROMEO:
Re-enter TYBALT
ROMEO:
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
ROMEO:
That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio's soul
ROMEO:
Is but a little way above our heads,
ROMEO:
Staying for thine to keep him company
ROMEO:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
TYBALT:
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
TYBALT:
Shalt with him hence.
ROMEO:
This shall determine that.
ROMEO:
They fight, TYBALT falls
BENVOLIO:
Romeo, away, be gone!
BENVOLIO:
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
BENVOLIO:
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
BENVOLIO:
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
ROMEO:
O, I am fortune's fool!
BENVOLIO:
Why dost thou stay?
BENVOLIO:
Exit ROMEO
BENVOLIO:
Enter Citizens,  and c
First Citizen:
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
First Citizen:
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
BENVOLIO:
There lies that Tybalt.
First Citizen:
Up, sir, go with me,
First Citizen:
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
First Citizen:
Enter Prince, attended, MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
PRINCE:
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
BENVOLIO:
O noble prince, I can discover all
BENVOLIO:
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
BENVOLIO:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
BENVOLIO:
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
LADY CAPULET:
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
LADY CAPULET:
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
LADY CAPULET:
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
LADY CAPULET:
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
LADY CAPULET:
O cousin, cousin!
PRINCE:
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay,
BENVOLIO:
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
BENVOLIO:
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
BENVOLIO:
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
BENVOLIO:
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
BENVOLIO:
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
BENVOLIO:
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
BENVOLIO:
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
BENVOLIO:
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
BENVOLIO:
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
BENVOLIO:
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
BENVOLIO:
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
BENVOLIO:
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
BENVOLIO:
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
BENVOLIO:
his tongue,
BENVOLIO:
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
BENVOLIO:
And 'twixt them rushes, underneath whose arm
BENVOLIO:
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
BENVOLIO:
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled,
BENVOLIO:
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
BENVOLIO:
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
BENVOLIO:
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
BENVOLIO:
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
BENVOLIO:
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
BENVOLIO:
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
LADY CAPULET:
He is a kinsman to the Montague,
LADY CAPULET:
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true
LADY CAPULET:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
LADY CAPULET:
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
LADY CAPULET:
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give,
LADY CAPULET:
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
PRINCE:
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio,
PRINCE:
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
MONTAGUE:
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend,
MONTAGUE:
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
MONTAGUE:
The life of Tybalt.
PRINCE:
And for that offence
PRINCE:
Immediately we do exile him hence
PRINCE:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
PRINCE:
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding,
PRINCE:
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
PRINCE:
That you shall all repent the loss of mine
PRINCE:
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses,
PRINCE:
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
PRINCE:
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
PRINCE:
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
PRINCE:
Bear hence this body and attend our will
PRINCE:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
PRINCE:
Exeunt
PRINCE:
SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
PRINCE:
Enter JULIET
JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
JULIET:
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
JULIET:
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
JULIET:
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
JULIET:
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
JULIET:
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
JULIET:
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
JULIET:
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
JULIET:
By their own beauties, or, if love be blind,
JULIET:
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
JULIET:
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
JULIET:
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
JULIET:
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
JULIET:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
JULIET:
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grown bold,
JULIET:
Think true love acted simple modesty.
JULIET:
Come, night, come, Romeo, come, thou day in night,
JULIET:
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
JULIET:
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
JULIET:
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
JULIET:
Give me my Romeo, and, when he shall die,
JULIET:
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
JULIET:
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
JULIET:
That all the world will be in love with night
JULIET:
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
JULIET:
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
JULIET:
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
JULIET:
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
JULIET:
As is the night before some festival
JULIET:
To an impatient child that hath new robes
JULIET:
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
JULIET:
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
JULIET:
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
JULIET:
Enter Nurse, with cords
JULIET:
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
JULIET:
That Romeo bid thee fetch?
Nurse:
Ay, ay, the cords.
Nurse:
Throws them down
JULIET:
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
Nurse:
Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
Nurse:
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Nurse:
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
JULIET:
Can heaven be so envious?
Nurse:
Romeo can,
Nurse:
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Nurse:
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
JULIET:
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
JULIET:
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
JULIET:
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
JULIET:
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
JULIET:
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice
JULIET:
I am not I, if there be such an I,
JULIET:
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
JULIET:
If he be slain, say 'I', or if not, no
JULIET:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
Nurse:
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
Nurse:
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast
Nurse:
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,
Nurse:
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
Nurse:
All in gore-blood, I swounded at the sight.
JULIET:
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
JULIET:
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
JULIET:
Vile earth, to earth resign, end motion here,
JULIET:
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
Nurse:
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
Nurse:
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
Nurse:
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
JULIET:
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
JULIET:
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
JULIET:
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
JULIET:
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
JULIET:
For who is living, if those two are gone?
Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
Nurse:
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
JULIET:
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
Nurse:
It did, it did, alas the day, it did!
JULIET:
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
JULIET:
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
JULIET:
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
JULIET:
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
JULIET:
Despised substance of divinest show!
JULIET:
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
JULIET:
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
JULIET:
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
JULIET:
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
JULIET:
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
JULIET:
Was ever book containing such vile matter
JULIET:
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
JULIET:
In such a gorgeous palace!
Nurse:
There's no trust,
Nurse:
No faith, no honesty in men, all perjured,
Nurse:
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Nurse:
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae
Nurse:
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Nurse:
Shame come to Romeo!
JULIET:
Blister'd be thy tongue
JULIET:
For such a wish! he was not born to shame
JULIET:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,
JULIET:
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
JULIET:
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
JULIET:
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
Nurse:
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
JULIET:
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
JULIET:
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
JULIET:
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
JULIET:
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
JULIET:
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband
JULIET:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
JULIET:
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
JULIET:
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
JULIET:
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
JULIET:
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband
JULIET:
All this is comfort, wherefore weep I then?
JULIET:
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
JULIET:
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain,
JULIET:
But, O, it presses to my memory,
JULIET:
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds
JULIET:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished,'
JULIET:
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
JULIET:
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
JULIET:
Was woe enough, if it had ended there
JULIET:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
JULIET:
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
JULIET:
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
JULIET:
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
JULIET:
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
JULIET:
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
JULIET:
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
JULIET:
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
JULIET:
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
JULIET:
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
JULIET:
In that word's death, no words can that woe sound.
JULIET:
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
Nurse:
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse
Nurse:
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
JULIET:
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
JULIET:
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
JULIET:
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
JULIET:
Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled
JULIET:
He made you for a highway to my bed,
JULIET:
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
JULIET:
Come, cords, come, nurse, I'll to my wedding-bed,
JULIET:
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
Nurse:
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
Nurse:
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Nurse:
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night
Nurse:
I'll to him, he is hid at Laurence' cell.
JULIET:
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
JULIET:
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
JULIET:
Exeunt
JULIET:
SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
JULIET:
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, come forth, come forth, thou fearful man
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And thou art wedded to calamity.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Enter ROMEO
ROMEO:
Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
ROMEO:
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
ROMEO:
That I yet know not?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Too familiar
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Is my dear son with such sour company
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
ROMEO:
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not body's death, but body's banishment.
ROMEO:
Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death,'
ROMEO:
For exile hath more terror in his look,
ROMEO:
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hence from Verona art thou banished
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
ROMEO:
There is no world without Verona walls,
ROMEO:
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
ROMEO:
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
ROMEO:
And world's exile is death: then banished,
ROMEO:
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
ROMEO:
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
ROMEO:
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And turn'd that black word death to banishment
FRIAR LAURENCE:
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
ROMEO:
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
ROMEO:
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog
ROMEO:
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
ROMEO:
Live here in heaven and may look on her,
ROMEO:
But Romeo may not: more validity,
ROMEO:
More honourable state, more courtship lives
ROMEO:
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
ROMEO:
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
ROMEO:
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
ROMEO:
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
ROMEO:
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin,
ROMEO:
But Romeo may not, he is banished
ROMEO:
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly
ROMEO:
They are free men, but I am banished.
ROMEO:
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
ROMEO:
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
ROMEO:
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
ROMEO:
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
ROMEO:
O friar, the damned use that word in hell,
ROMEO:
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
ROMEO:
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
ROMEO:
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
ROMEO:
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
ROMEO:
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
ROMEO:
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
ROMEO:
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
ROMEO:
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
ROMEO:
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
ROMEO:
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
ROMEO:
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
ROMEO:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
ROMEO:
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
ROMEO:
Doting like me and like me banished,
ROMEO:
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
ROMEO:
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
ROMEO:
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
ROMEO:
Knocking within
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Arise, one knocks, good Romeo, hide thyself.
ROMEO:
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,
ROMEO:
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
ROMEO:
Knocking
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Knocking
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Knocking
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
Nurse:
[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall know
Nurse:
my errand,
Nurse:
I come from Lady Juliet.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Welcome, then.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Enter Nurse
Nurse:
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Nurse:
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
Nurse:
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Nurse:
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Nurse:
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Nurse:
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Nurse:
Stand up, stand up, stand, and you be a man
Nurse:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand,
Nurse:
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
ROMEO:
Nurse!
Nurse:
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
ROMEO:
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
ROMEO:
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
ROMEO:
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
ROMEO:
With blood removed but little from her own?
ROMEO:
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
ROMEO:
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
Nurse:
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,
Nurse:
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
Nurse:
And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
Nurse:
And then down falls again.
ROMEO:
As if that name,
ROMEO:
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
ROMEO:
Did murder her, as that name's cursed hand
ROMEO:
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
ROMEO:
In what vile part of this anatomy
ROMEO:
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
ROMEO:
The hateful mansion.
ROMEO:
Drawing his sword
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold thy desperate hand
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The unreasonable fury of a beast
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
FRIAR LAURENCE:
In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And usest none in that true use indeed
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Digressing from the valour of a man,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But thou slew'st Tybalt, there are thou happy too
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And turns it to exile, there art thou happy
FRIAR LAURENCE:
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Happiness courts thee in her best array,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
FRIAR LAURENCE:
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo is coming.
Nurse:
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
Nurse:
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
Nurse:
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
ROMEO:
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Nurse:
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir
Nurse:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
Nurse:
Exit
ROMEO:
How well my comfort is revived by this!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go hence, good night, and here stands all your state
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Or by the break of day disguised from hence
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sojourn in Mantua, I'll find out your man,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And he shall signify from time to time
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Every good hap to you that chances here
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Give me thy hand, 'tis late: farewell, good night.
ROMEO:
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
ROMEO:
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
ROMEO:
Exeunt
ROMEO:
SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
ROMEO:
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
CAPULET:
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
CAPULET:
That we have had no time to move our daughter
CAPULET:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
CAPULET:
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
CAPULET:
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night
CAPULET:
I promise you, but for your company,
CAPULET:
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
PARIS:
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
PARIS:
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
LADY CAPULET:
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow,
LADY CAPULET:
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
CAPULET:
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
CAPULET:
In all respects by me, nay, more, I doubt it not.
CAPULET:
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
CAPULET:
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love,
CAPULET:
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
CAPULET:
But, soft! what day is this?
PARIS:
Monday, my lord,
CAPULET:
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
CAPULET:
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
CAPULET:
She shall be married to this noble earl.
CAPULET:
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
CAPULET:
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two,
CAPULET:
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
CAPULET:
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
CAPULET:
Being our kinsman, if we revel much
CAPULET:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
CAPULET:
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
PARIS:
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
CAPULET:
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
CAPULET:
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
CAPULET:
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
CAPULET:
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
CAPULET:
Afore me! it is so very very late,
CAPULET:
That we may call it early by and by.
CAPULET:
Good night.
CAPULET:
Exeunt
CAPULET:
SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
CAPULET:
Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
JULIET:
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day
JULIET:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
JULIET:
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear,
JULIET:
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree
JULIET:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
ROMEO:
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
ROMEO:
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
ROMEO:
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
ROMEO:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
ROMEO:
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
ROMEO:
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
JULIET:
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I
JULIET:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
JULIET:
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
JULIET:
And light thee on thy way to Mantua
JULIET:
Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone.
ROMEO:
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death,
ROMEO:
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
ROMEO:
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
ROMEO:
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow,
ROMEO:
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
ROMEO:
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads
ROMEO:
I have more care to stay than will to go
ROMEO:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
ROMEO:
How is't, my soul? let's talk, it is not day.
JULIET:
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
JULIET:
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
JULIET:
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
JULIET:
Some say the lark makes sweet division,
JULIET:
This doth not so, for she divideth us
JULIET:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
JULIET:
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
JULIET:
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
JULIET:
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
JULIET:
O, now be gone, more light and light it grows.
ROMEO:
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!
ROMEO:
Enter Nurse, to the chamber
Nurse:
Madam!
JULIET:
Nurse?
Nurse:
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
Nurse:
The day is broke, be wary, look about.
Nurse:
Exit
JULIET:
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
ROMEO:
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
ROMEO:
He goeth down
JULIET:
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
JULIET:
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
JULIET:
For in a minute there are many days
JULIET:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
JULIET:
Ere I again behold my Romeo!
ROMEO:
Farewell!
ROMEO:
I will omit no opportunity
ROMEO:
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
JULIET:
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
ROMEO:
I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve
ROMEO:
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
JULIET:
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
JULIET:
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
JULIET:
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
JULIET:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
ROMEO:
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you
ROMEO:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
ROMEO:
Exit
JULIET:
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle
JULIET:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
JULIET:
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune,
JULIET:
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
JULIET:
But send him back.
LADY CAPULET:
[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?
JULIET:
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
JULIET:
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
JULIET:
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
JULIET:
Enter LADY CAPULET
LADY CAPULET:
Why, how now, Juliet!
JULIET:
Madam, I am not well.
LADY CAPULET:
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
LADY CAPULET:
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
LADY CAPULET:
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live,
LADY CAPULET:
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love,
LADY CAPULET:
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
JULIET:
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
LADY CAPULET:
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
LADY CAPULET:
Which you weep for.
JULIET:
Feeling so the loss,
JULIET:
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
LADY CAPULET:
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
LADY CAPULET:
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
JULIET:
What villain madam?
LADY CAPULET:
That same villain, Romeo.
JULIET:
[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
JULIET:
God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart,
JULIET:
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
LADY CAPULET:
That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
JULIET:
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands
JULIET:
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
LADY CAPULET:
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not
LADY CAPULET:
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
LADY CAPULET:
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
LADY CAPULET:
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
LADY CAPULET:
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
LADY CAPULET:
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
JULIET:
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
JULIET:
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
JULIET:
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
JULIET:
Madam, if you could find out but a man
JULIET:
To bear a poison, I would temper it,
JULIET:
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
JULIET:
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
JULIET:
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
JULIET:
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
JULIET:
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
LADY CAPULET:
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
LADY CAPULET:
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
JULIET:
And joy comes well in such a needy time
JULIET:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child,
LADY CAPULET:
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
LADY CAPULET:
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
LADY CAPULET:
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
JULIET:
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
LADY CAPULET:
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
LADY CAPULET:
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
LADY CAPULET:
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
LADY CAPULET:
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
JULIET:
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
JULIET:
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
JULIET:
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
JULIET:
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
JULIET:
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
JULIET:
I will not marry yet, and, when I do, I swear,
JULIET:
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
JULIET:
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
LADY CAPULET:
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,
LADY CAPULET:
And see how he will take it at your hands.
LADY CAPULET:
Enter CAPULET and Nurse
CAPULET:
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew,
CAPULET:
But for the sunset of my brother's son
CAPULET:
It rains downright.
CAPULET:
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
CAPULET:
Evermore showering? In one little body
CAPULET:
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind,
CAPULET:
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
CAPULET:
Do ebb and flow with tears, the bark thy body is,
CAPULET:
Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
CAPULET:
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
CAPULET:
Without a sudden calm, will overset
CAPULET:
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
CAPULET:
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
LADY CAPULET:
Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.
LADY CAPULET:
I would the fool were married to her grave!
CAPULET:
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
CAPULET:
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
CAPULET:
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
CAPULET:
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
CAPULET:
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
JULIET:
Not proud, you have, but thankful, that you have
JULIET:
Proud can I never be of what I hate,
JULIET:
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
CAPULET:
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
CAPULET:
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not,'
CAPULET:
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
CAPULET:
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
CAPULET:
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
CAPULET:
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
CAPULET:
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
CAPULET:
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
CAPULET:
You tallow-face!
LADY CAPULET:
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
JULIET:
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
JULIET:
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
CAPULET:
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
CAPULET:
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
CAPULET:
Or never after look me in the face
CAPULET:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me,
CAPULET:
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
CAPULET:
That God had lent us but this only child,
CAPULET:
But now I see this one is one too much,
CAPULET:
And that we have a curse in having her
CAPULET:
Out on her, hilding!
Nurse:
God in heaven bless her!
Nurse:
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
CAPULET:
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
CAPULET:
Good prudence, smatter with your gossips, go.
Nurse:
I speak no treason.
CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.
Nurse:
May not one speak?
CAPULET:
Peace, you mumbling fool!
CAPULET:
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
CAPULET:
For here we need it not.
LADY CAPULET:
You are too hot.
CAPULET:
God's bread! it makes me mad
CAPULET:
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
CAPULET:
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
CAPULET:
To have her match'd: and having now provided
CAPULET:
A gentleman of noble parentage,
CAPULET:
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
CAPULET:
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
CAPULET:
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man,
CAPULET:
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
CAPULET:
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
CAPULET:
To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love,
CAPULET:
I am too young, I pray you, pardon me.'
CAPULET:
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you
CAPULET:
Graze where you will you shall not house with me
CAPULET:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
CAPULET:
Thursday is near, lay hand on heart, advise
CAPULET:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend,
CAPULET:
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
CAPULET:
the streets,
CAPULET:
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
CAPULET:
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good
CAPULET:
Trust to't, bethink you, I'll not be forsworn.
CAPULET:
Exit
JULIET:
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
JULIET:
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
JULIET:
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
JULIET:
Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
JULIET:
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
JULIET:
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word
LADY CAPULET:
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
LADY CAPULET:
Exit
JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
JULIET:
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven,
JULIET:
How shall that faith return again to earth,
JULIET:
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
JULIET:
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
JULIET:
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
JULIET:
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
JULIET:
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
JULIET:
Some comfort, nurse.
Nurse:
Faith, here it is.
Nurse:
Romeo is banish'd, and all the world to nothing,
Nurse:
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you,
Nurse:
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Nurse:
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
Nurse:
I think it best you married with the county.
Nurse:
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Nurse:
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Nurse:
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
Nurse:
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
Nurse:
I think you are happy in this second match,
Nurse:
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Nurse:
Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were,
Nurse:
As living here and you no use of him.
JULIET:
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Nurse:
And from my soul too,
Nurse:
Or else beshrew them both.
JULIET:
Amen!
Nurse:
What?
JULIET:
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
JULIET:
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
JULIET:
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
JULIET:
To make confession and to be absolved.
Nurse:
Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.
Nurse:
Exit
JULIET:
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
JULIET:
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
JULIET:
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
JULIET:
Which she hath praised him with above compare
JULIET:
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor,
JULIET:
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
JULIET:
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy
JULIET:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
JULIET:
Exit
JULIET:
ACT IV
JULIET:
SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
JULIET:
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
PARIS:
My father Capulet will have it so,
PARIS:
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
You say you do not know the lady's mind
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Uneven is the course, I like it not.
PARIS:
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
PARIS:
And therefore have I little talk'd of love,
PARIS:
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
PARIS:
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
PARIS:
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
PARIS:
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
PARIS:
To stop the inundation of her tears,
PARIS:
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
PARIS:
May be put from her by society
PARIS:
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Enter JULIET
PARIS:
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
JULIET:
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
PARIS:
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
JULIET:
What must be shall be.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
That's a certain text.
PARIS:
Come you to make confession to this father?
JULIET:
To answer that, I should confess to you.
PARIS:
Do not deny to him that you love me.
JULIET:
I will confess to you that I love him.
PARIS:
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
JULIET:
If I do so, it will be of more price,
JULIET:
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
PARIS:
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
JULIET:
The tears have got small victory by that,
JULIET:
For it was bad enough before their spite.
PARIS:
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
JULIET:
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
JULIET:
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
PARIS:
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
JULIET:
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
JULIET:
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
JULIET:
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
PARIS:
God shield I should disturb devotion!
PARIS:
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye
PARIS:
Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.
PARIS:
Exit
JULIET:
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
JULIET:
Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
It strains me past the compass of my wits
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thursday next be married to this county.
JULIET:
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
JULIET:
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
JULIET:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
JULIET:
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
JULIET:
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
JULIET:
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands,
JULIET:
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
JULIET:
Shall be the label to another deed,
JULIET:
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
JULIET:
Turn to another, this shall slay them both
JULIET:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
JULIET:
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
JULIET:
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
JULIET:
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
JULIET:
Which the commission of thy years and art
JULIET:
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
JULIET:
Be not so long to speak, I long to die,
JULIET:
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Which craves as desperate an execution.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
FRIAR LAURENCE:
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
That copest with death himself to scape from it
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
JULIET:
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
JULIET:
From off the battlements of yonder tower,
JULIET:
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
JULIET:
Where serpents are, chain me with roaring bears,
JULIET:
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
JULIET:
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
JULIET:
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls,
JULIET:
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
JULIET:
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud,
JULIET:
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
JULIET:
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
JULIET:
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, then, go home, be merry, give consent
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And this distilled liquor drink thou off,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
When presently through all thy veins shall run
FRIAR LAURENCE:
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease
FRIAR LAURENCE:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Each part, deprived of supple government,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Then, as the manner of our country is,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And hither shall he come: and he and I
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
JULIET:
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, get you gone, be strong and prosperous
FRIAR LAURENCE:
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
JULIET:
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
JULIET:
Farewell, dear father!
JULIET:
Exeunt
JULIET:
SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
JULIET:
Enter CAPULET, LADY  CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
CAPULET:
So many guests invite as here are writ.
CAPULET:
Exit First Servant
CAPULET:
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
Second Servant:
You shall have none ill, sir, for I'll try if they
Second Servant:
can lick their fingers.
CAPULET:
How canst thou try them so?
Second Servant:
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
Second Servant:
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
Second Servant:
fingers goes not with me.
CAPULET:
Go, be gone.
CAPULET:
Exit Second Servant
CAPULET:
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
CAPULET:
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
Nurse:
Ay, forsooth.
CAPULET:
Well, he may chance to do some good on her
CAPULET:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
Nurse:
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
Nurse:
Enter JULIET
CAPULET:
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
JULIET:
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
JULIET:
Of disobedient opposition
JULIET:
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
JULIET:
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
JULIET:
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
JULIET:
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
CAPULET:
Send for the county, go tell him of this
CAPULET:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
JULIET:
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell,
JULIET:
And gave him what becomed love I might,
JULIET:
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
CAPULET:
Why, I am glad on't, this is well: stand up
CAPULET:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county,
CAPULET:
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
CAPULET:
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
CAPULET:
Our whole city is much bound to him.
JULIET:
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
JULIET:
To help me sort such needful ornaments
JULIET:
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
LADY CAPULET:
No, not till Thursday, there is time enough.
CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
CAPULET:
Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
LADY  CAPULET:
We shall be short in our provision
LADY  CAPULET:
'Tis now near night.
CAPULET:
Tush, I will stir about,
CAPULET:
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife
CAPULET:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her,
CAPULET:
I'll not to bed to-night, let me alone,
CAPULET:
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
CAPULET:
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
CAPULET:
To County Paris, to prepare him up
CAPULET:
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
CAPULET:
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
CAPULET:
Exeunt
CAPULET:
SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
CAPULET:
Enter JULIET and Nurse
JULIET:
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
JULIET:
I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
JULIET:
For I have need of many orisons
JULIET:
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
JULIET:
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
JULIET:
Enter LADY CAPULET
LADY CAPULET:
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
JULIET:
No, madam, we have cull'd such necessaries
JULIET:
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow
JULIET:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
JULIET:
And let the nurse this night sit up with you,
JULIET:
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
JULIET:
In this so sudden business.
LADY CAPULET:
Good night
LADY CAPULET:
Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou hast need.
LADY CAPULET:
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
JULIET:
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
JULIET:
That almost freezes up the heat of life
JULIET:
I'll call them back again to comfort me
JULIET:
Nurse! What should she do here?
JULIET:
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
JULIET:
Come, vial.
JULIET:
What if this mixture do not work at all?
JULIET:
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
JULIET:
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
JULIET:
Laying down her dagger
JULIET:
What if it be a poison, which the friar
JULIET:
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
JULIET:
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
JULIET:
Because he married me before to Romeo?
JULIET:
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
JULIET:
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
JULIET:
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
JULIET:
I wake before the time that Romeo
JULIET:
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
JULIET:
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
JULIET:
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
JULIET:
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
JULIET:
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
JULIET:
The horrible conceit of death and night,
JULIET:
Together with the terror of the place,--
JULIET:
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
JULIET:
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
JULIET:
Of all my buried ancestors are packed
JULIET:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
JULIET:
Lies festering in his shroud, where, as they say,
JULIET:
At some hours in the night spirits resort,--
JULIET:
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
JULIET:
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
JULIET:
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
JULIET:
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
JULIET:
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
JULIET:
Environed with all these hideous fears?
JULIET:
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
JULIET:
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
JULIET:
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
JULIET:
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
JULIET:
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
JULIET:
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
JULIET:
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
JULIET:
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
JULIET:
She falls upon her bed, within the curtains
JULIET:
SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.
JULIET:
Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
LADY CAPULET:
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
Nurse:
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Nurse:
Enter CAPULET
CAPULET:
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
CAPULET:
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock
CAPULET:
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica
CAPULET:
Spare not for the cost.
Nurse:
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Nurse:
Get you to bed, faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
Nurse:
For this night's watching.
CAPULET:
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
CAPULET:
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
LADY CAPULET:
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,
LADY CAPULET:
But I will watch you from such watching now.
LADY CAPULET:
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
CAPULET:
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
CAPULET:
Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
CAPULET:
Now, fellow,
CAPULET:
What's there?
First Servant:
Things for the cook, sir, but I know not what.
CAPULET:
Make haste, make haste.
CAPULET:
Exit First Servant
CAPULET:
Sirrah, fetch drier logs
CAPULET:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
Second Servant:
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
Second Servant:
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
Second Servant:
Exit
CAPULET:
Mass, and well said, a merry whoreson, ha!
CAPULET:
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day
CAPULET:
The county will be here with music straight,
CAPULET:
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
CAPULET:
Music within
CAPULET:
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
CAPULET:
Re-enter Nurse
CAPULET:
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up,
CAPULET:
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
CAPULET:
Make haste, the bridegroom he is come already
CAPULET:
Make haste, I say.
CAPULET:
Exeunt
CAPULET:
SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
CAPULET:
Enter Nurse
Nurse:
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she
Nurse:
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Nurse:
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
Nurse:
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now,
Nurse:
Sleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant,
Nurse:
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
Nurse:
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Nurse:
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
Nurse:
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Nurse:
Ay, let the county take you in your bed,
Nurse:
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
Nurse:
Undraws the curtains
Nurse:
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
Nurse:
I must needs wake you, Lady! lady! lady!
Nurse:
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
Nurse:
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
Nurse:
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
Nurse:
Enter LADY CAPULET
LADY CAPULET:
What noise is here?
Nurse:
O lamentable day!
LADY CAPULET:
What is the matter?
Nurse:
Look, look! O heavy day!
LADY CAPULET:
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
LADY CAPULET:
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
LADY CAPULET:
Help, help! Call help.
LADY CAPULET:
Enter CAPULET
CAPULET:
For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come.
Nurse:
She's dead, deceased, she's dead, alack the day!
LADY CAPULET:
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
CAPULET:
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold
CAPULET:
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff,
CAPULET:
Life and these lips have long been separated
CAPULET:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
CAPULET:
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
Nurse:
O lamentable day!
LADY CAPULET:
O woful time!
CAPULET:
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
CAPULET:
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
CAPULET:
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
CAPULET:
Ready to go, but never to return.
CAPULET:
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
CAPULET:
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
CAPULET:
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
CAPULET:
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir,
CAPULET:
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
CAPULET:
And leave him all, life, living, all is Death's.
PARIS:
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
PARIS:
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
LADY CAPULET:
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
LADY CAPULET:
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
LADY CAPULET:
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
LADY CAPULET:
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
LADY CAPULET:
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
LADY CAPULET:
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
Nurse:
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Nurse:
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
Nurse:
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
Nurse:
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Nurse:
Never was seen so black a day as this
Nurse:
O woful day, O woful day!
PARIS:
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
PARIS:
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
PARIS:
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
PARIS:
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
CAPULET:
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
CAPULET:
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
CAPULET:
To murder, murder our solemnity?
CAPULET:
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
CAPULET:
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead,
CAPULET:
And with my child my joys are buried.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
FRIAR LAURENCE:
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And all the better is it for the maid
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The most you sought was her promotion,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
That you run mad, seeing that she is well
FRIAR LAURENCE:
She's not well married that lives married long,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But she's best married that dies married young.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
FRIAR LAURENCE:
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
In all her best array bear her to church
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
CAPULET:
All things that we ordained festival,
CAPULET:
Turn from their office to black funeral,
CAPULET:
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
CAPULET:
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
CAPULET:
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
CAPULET:
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
CAPULET:
And all things change them to the contrary.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And go, Sir Paris, every one prepare
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To follow this fair corse unto her grave
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Move them no more by crossing their high will.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE

Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up,

For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
Nurse:
Exit
First Musician:
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

Enter PETER
PETER:
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
PETER:
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
First Musician:
Why 'Heart's ease?'
PETER:
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
PETER:
heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
PETER:
to comfort me.
First Musician:
Not a dump we, 'tis no time to play now.
PETER:
You will not, then?
First Musician:
No.
PETER:
I will then give it you soundly.
First Musician:
What will you give us?
PETER:
No money, on my faith, but the gleek,
PETER:
I will give you the minstrel.
First Musician:
Then I will give you the serving-creature.
PETER:
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
PETER:
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
PETER:
I'll fa you, do you note me?
First Musician:
An you re us and fa us, you note us.
Second Musician:
Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
PETER:
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
PETER:
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
PETER:
me like men
PETER:
'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
PETER:
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
PETER:
Then music with her silver sound'--
PETER:
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
PETER:
sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
Musician:
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
PETER:
Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
Second Musician:
I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
PETER:
Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
Third Musician:
Faith, I know not what to say.
PETER:
O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer: I will say
PETER:
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
PETER:
because musicians have no gold for sounding
PETER:
'Then music with her silver sound
PETER:
With speedy help doth lend redress.'
PETER:
Exit
First Musician:
What a pestilent knave is this same!
Second Musician:
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the
Second Musician:
mourners, and stay dinner.
Second Musician:
Exeunt
Second Musician:
ACT V
Second Musician:
SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
Second Musician:
Enter ROMEO
ROMEO:
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
ROMEO:
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
ROMEO:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
ROMEO:
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
ROMEO:
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
ROMEO:
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
ROMEO:
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
ROMEO:
to think!--
ROMEO:
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
ROMEO:
That I revived, and was an emperor.
ROMEO:
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
ROMEO:
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
ROMEO:
Enter BALTHASAR, booted
ROMEO:
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
ROMEO:
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
ROMEO:
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
ROMEO:
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again,
ROMEO:
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
BALTHASAR:
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill
BALTHASAR:
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
BALTHASAR:
And her immortal part with angels lives.
BALTHASAR:
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
BALTHASAR:
And presently took post to tell it you
BALTHASAR:
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
BALTHASAR:
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
ROMEO:
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
ROMEO:
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
ROMEO:
And hire post-horses, I will hence to-night.
BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, sir, have patience
BALTHASAR:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
BALTHASAR:
Some misadventure.
ROMEO:
Tush, thou art deceived
ROMEO:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
ROMEO:
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
BALTHASAR:
No, my good lord.
ROMEO:
No matter: get thee gone,
ROMEO:
And hire those horses, I'll be with thee straight.
ROMEO:
Exit BALTHASAR
ROMEO:
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
ROMEO:
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
ROMEO:
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
ROMEO:
I do remember an apothecary,--
ROMEO:
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
ROMEO:
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
ROMEO:
Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,
ROMEO:
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones
ROMEO:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
ROMEO:
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
ROMEO:
Of ill-shaped fishes, and about his shelves
ROMEO:
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
ROMEO:
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
ROMEO:
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
ROMEO:
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
ROMEO:
Noting this penury, to myself I said
ROMEO:
'An if a man did need a poison now,
ROMEO:
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
ROMEO:
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
ROMEO:
O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
ROMEO:
And this same needy man must sell it me.
ROMEO:
As I remember, this should be the house.
ROMEO:
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
ROMEO:
What, ho! apothecary!
ROMEO:
Enter Apothecary
Apothecary:
Who calls so loud?
ROMEO:
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor
ROMEO:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
ROMEO:
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
ROMEO:
As will disperse itself through all the veins
ROMEO:
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
ROMEO:
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
ROMEO:
As violently as hasty powder fired
ROMEO:
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
Apothecary:
Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law
Apothecary:
Is death to any he that utters them.
ROMEO:
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
ROMEO:
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
ROMEO:
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
ROMEO:
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back,
ROMEO:
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law,
ROMEO:
The world affords no law to make thee rich,
ROMEO:
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Apothecary:
My poverty, but not my will, consents.
ROMEO:
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Apothecary:
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
Apothecary:
And drink it off, and, if you had the strength
Apothecary:
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
ROMEO:
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
ROMEO:
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
ROMEO:
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
ROMEO:
I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
ROMEO:
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
ROMEO:
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
ROMEO:
To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.
ROMEO:
Exeunt
ROMEO:
SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
ROMEO:
Enter FRIAR JOHN
FRIAR JOHN:
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
FRIAR JOHN:
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
FRIAR LAURENCE:
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
FRIAR JOHN:
Going to find a bare-foot brother out
FRIAR JOHN:
One of our order, to associate me,
FRIAR JOHN:
Here in this city visiting the sick,
FRIAR JOHN:
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
FRIAR JOHN:
Suspecting that we both were in a house
FRIAR JOHN:
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
FRIAR JOHN:
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
FRIAR JOHN:
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
FRIAR JOHN:
I could not send it,--here it is again,--
FRIAR JOHN:
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
FRIAR JOHN:
So fearful were they of infection.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The letter was not nice but full of charge
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
FRIAR LAURENCE:
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unto my cell.
FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
FRIAR JOHN:
Exit
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now must I to the monument alone,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake
FRIAR LAURENCE:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hath had no notice of these accidents,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But I will write again to Mantua,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Exit
FRIAR LAURENCE:
SCENE III. A churchyard, in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
PARIS:
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof
PARIS:
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
PARIS:
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
PARIS:
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground,
PARIS:
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
PARIS:
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
PARIS:
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
PARIS:
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
PARIS:
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
PAGE:
[Aside]  I am almost afraid to stand alone
PAGE:
Here in the churchyard, yet I will adventure.
PAGE:
Retires
PARIS:
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
PARIS:
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones,--
PARIS:
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
PARIS:
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans
PARIS:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
PARIS:
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
PARIS:
The Page whistles
PARIS:
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
PARIS:
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
PARIS:
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
PARIS:
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
PARIS:
Retires
PARIS:
Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock,  and c
ROMEO:
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
ROMEO:
Hold, take this letter, early in the morning
ROMEO:
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
ROMEO:
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
ROMEO:
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
ROMEO:
And do not interrupt me in my course.
ROMEO:
Why I descend into this bed of death,
ROMEO:
Is partly to behold my lady's face,
ROMEO:
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
ROMEO:
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
ROMEO:
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone
ROMEO:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
ROMEO:
In what I further shall intend to do,
ROMEO:
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
ROMEO:
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
ROMEO:
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
ROMEO:
More fierce and more inexorable far
ROMEO:
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
BALTHASAR:
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
ROMEO:
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that
ROMEO:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
BALTHASAR:
[Aside]  For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout
BALTHASAR:
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
BALTHASAR:
Retires
ROMEO:
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
ROMEO:
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
ROMEO:
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
ROMEO:
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
ROMEO:
Opens the tomb
PARIS:
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
PARIS:
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
PARIS:
It is supposed, the fair creature died,
PARIS:
And here is come to do some villanous shame
PARIS:
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
PARIS:
Comes forward
PARIS:
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
PARIS:
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
PARIS:
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee
PARIS:
Obey, and go with me, for thou must die.
ROMEO:
I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.
ROMEO:
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man,
ROMEO:
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone,
ROMEO:
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
ROMEO:
Put not another sin upon my head,
ROMEO:
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
ROMEO:
By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
ROMEO:
For I come hither arm'd against myself
ROMEO:
Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,
ROMEO:
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
PARIS:
I do defy thy conjurations,
PARIS:
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
ROMEO:
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
ROMEO:
They fight
PAGE:
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
PAGE:
Exit
PARIS:
O, I am slain!
PARIS:
Falls
PARIS:
If thou be merciful,
PARIS:
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
PARIS:
Dies
ROMEO:
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
ROMEO:
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
ROMEO:
What said my man, when my betossed soul
ROMEO:
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
ROMEO:
He told me Paris should have married Juliet
ROMEO:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
ROMEO:
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
ROMEO:
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
ROMEO:
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
ROMEO:
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave,
ROMEO:
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
ROMEO:
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
ROMEO:
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
ROMEO:
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
ROMEO:
Laying PARIS in the tomb
ROMEO:
How oft when men are at the point of death
ROMEO:
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
ROMEO:
A lightning before death: O, how may I
ROMEO:
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
ROMEO:
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
ROMEO:
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
ROMEO:
Thou art not conquer'd, beauty's ensign yet
ROMEO:
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
ROMEO:
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
ROMEO:
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
ROMEO:
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
ROMEO:
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
ROMEO:
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
ROMEO:
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
ROMEO:
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
ROMEO:
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
ROMEO:
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
ROMEO:
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
ROMEO:
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee,
ROMEO:
And never from this palace of dim night
ROMEO:
Depart again: here, here will I remain
ROMEO:
With worms that are thy chamber-maids, O, here
ROMEO:
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
ROMEO:
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
ROMEO:
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
ROMEO:
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
ROMEO:
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
ROMEO:
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
ROMEO:
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
ROMEO:
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
ROMEO:
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
ROMEO:
Here's to my love!
ROMEO:
Drinks
ROMEO:
O true apothecary!
ROMEO:
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
ROMEO:
Dies
ROMEO:
Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
BALTHASAR:
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
It burneth in the Capel's monument.
BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir, and there's my master,
BALTHASAR:
One that you love.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who is it?
BALTHASAR:
Romeo.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
How long hath he been there?
BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go with me to the vault.
BALTHASAR:
I dare not, sir
BALTHASAR:
My master knows not but I am gone hence,
BALTHASAR:
And fearfully did menace me with death,
BALTHASAR:
If I did stay to look on his intents.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Stay, then, I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me
FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
BALTHASAR:
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
BALTHASAR:
I dreamt my master and another fought,
BALTHASAR:
And that my master slew him.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Advances
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
What mean these masterless and gory swords
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Enters the tomb
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The lady stirs.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
JULIET wakes
JULIET:
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
JULIET:
I do remember well where I should be,
JULIET:
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
JULIET:
Noise within
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep
FRIAR LAURENCE:
A greater power than we can contradict
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, go, good Juliet,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Noise again
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I dare no longer stay.
JULIET:
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
JULIET:
Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
JULIET:
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
JULIET:
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end
JULIET:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
JULIET:
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips,
JULIET:
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
JULIET:
To make die with a restorative.
JULIET:
Kisses him
JULIET:
Thy lips are warm.
First Watchman:
[Within]  Lead, boy: which way?
JULIET:
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
JULIET:
Snatching ROMEO's dagger
JULIET:
This is thy sheath,
JULIET:
Stabs herself
JULIET:
there rust, and let me die.
JULIET:
Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies
JULIET:
Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS
PAGE:
This is the place, there, where the torch doth burn.
First Watchman:
The ground is bloody, search about the churchyard
First Watchman:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
First Watchman:
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
First Watchman:
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
First Watchman:
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
First Watchman:
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets
First Watchman:
Raise up the Montagues: some others search
First Watchman:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
First Watchman:
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
First Watchman:
We cannot without circumstance descry.
First Watchman:
Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR
Second Watchman:
Here's Romeo's man, we found him in the churchyard.
First Watchman:
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
First Watchman:
Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE
Third Watchman:
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps
Third Watchman:
We took this mattock and this spade from him,
Third Watchman:
As he was coming from this churchyard side.
First Watchman:
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
First Watchman:
Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
PRINCE:
What misadventure is so early up,
PRINCE:
That calls our person from our morning's rest?
PRINCE:
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
CAPULET:
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
LADY CAPULET:
The people in the street cry Romeo,
LADY CAPULET:
Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run,
LADY CAPULET:
With open outcry toward our monument.
PRINCE:
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
First Watchman:
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
First Watchman:
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
First Watchman:
Warm and new kill'd.
PRINCE:
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
First Watchman:
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
First Watchman:
With instruments upon them, fit to open
First Watchman:
These dead men's tombs.
CAPULET:
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
CAPULET:
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
CAPULET:
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
CAPULET:
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
LADY CAPULET:
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
LADY CAPULET:
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
LADY CAPULET:
Enter MONTAGUE and others
PRINCE:
Come, Montague, for thou art early up,
PRINCE:
To see thy son and heir more early down.
MONTAGUE:
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night,
MONTAGUE:
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath
MONTAGUE:
What further woe conspires against mine age?
PRINCE:
Look, and thou shalt see.
MONTAGUE:
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
MONTAGUE:
To press before thy father to a grave?
PRINCE:
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
PRINCE:
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
PRINCE:
And know their spring, their head, their
PRINCE:
true descent,
PRINCE:
And then will I be general of your woes,
PRINCE:
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
PRINCE:
And let mischance be slave to patience.
PRINCE:
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I am the greatest, able to do least,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Doth make against me of this direful murder,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Myself condemned and myself excused.
PRINCE:
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I married them, and their stol'n marriage-day
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To rid her from this second marriage,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
FRIAR LAURENCE:
As I intended, for it wrought on her
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
That he should hither come as this dire night,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
FRIAR LAURENCE:
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And bear this work of heaven with patience
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
FRIAR LAURENCE:
All this I know, and to the marriage
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unto the rigour of severest law.
PRINCE:
We still have known thee for a holy man.
PRINCE:
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
BALTHASAR:
I brought my master news of Juliet's death,
BALTHASAR:
And then in post he came from Mantua
BALTHASAR:
To this same place, to this same monument.
BALTHASAR:
This letter he early bid me give his father,
BALTHASAR:
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
BALTHASAR:
I departed not and left him there.
PRINCE:
Give me the letter, I will look on it.
PRINCE:
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
PRINCE:
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
PAGE:
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave,
PAGE:
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did
PAGE:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
PAGE:
And by and by my master drew on him,
PAGE:
And then I ran away to call the watch.
PRINCE:
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
PRINCE:
Their course of love, the tidings of her death
PRINCE:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
PRINCE:
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
PRINCE:
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
PRINCE:
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
PRINCE:
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
PRINCE:
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
PRINCE:
And I for winking at your discords too
PRINCE:
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
CAPULET:
O brother Montague, give me thy hand
CAPULET:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
CAPULET:
Can I demand.
MONTAGUE:
But I can give thee more
MONTAGUE:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
MONTAGUE:
That while Verona by that name is known,
MONTAGUE:
There shall no figure at such rate be set
MONTAGUE:
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
CAPULET:
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,
CAPULET:
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
PRINCE:
A glooming peace this morning with it brings,
PRINCE:
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head
PRINCE:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things,
PRINCE:
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished
PRINCE:
For never was a story of more woe
PRINCE:
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
PRINCE:
Exeunt
