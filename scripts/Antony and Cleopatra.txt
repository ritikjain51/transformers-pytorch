ROSALIND:
ACT I
ROSALIND:
SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.
ROSALIND:
Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO
PHILO:
Nay, but this dotage of our general's
PHILO:
O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
PHILO:
That o'er the files and musters of the war
PHILO:
Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
PHILO:
The office and devotion of their view
PHILO:
Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
PHILO:
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
PHILO:
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
PHILO:
And is become the bellows and the fan
PHILO:
To cool a gipsy's lust.
PHILO:
Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her
PHILO:
Look, where they come
PHILO:
Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
PHILO:
The triple pillar of the world transform'd
PHILO:
Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.
CLEOPATRA:
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
MARK ANTONY:
There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
CLEOPATRA:
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
MARK ANTONY:
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter an Attendant
Attendant:
News, my good lord, from Rome.
MARK ANTONY:
Grates me: the sum.
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, hear them, Antony
CLEOPATRA:
Fulvia perchance is angry, or, who knows
CLEOPATRA:
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
CLEOPATRA:
His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this,
CLEOPATRA:
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that,
CLEOPATRA:
Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
MARK ANTONY:
How, my love!
CLEOPATRA:
Perchance! nay, and most like
CLEOPATRA:
You must not stay here longer, your dismission
CLEOPATRA:
Is come from Caesar, therefore hear it, Antony.
CLEOPATRA:
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
CLEOPATRA:
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
CLEOPATRA:
Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
CLEOPATRA:
Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
CLEOPATRA:
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
MARK ANTONY:
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
MARK ANTONY:
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
MARK ANTONY:
Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
MARK ANTONY:
Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
MARK ANTONY:
Is to do thus, when such a mutual pair
MARK ANTONY:
Embracing
MARK ANTONY:
And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
MARK ANTONY:
On pain of punishment, the world to weet
MARK ANTONY:
We stand up peerless.
CLEOPATRA:
Excellent falsehood!
CLEOPATRA:
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
CLEOPATRA:
I'll seem the fool I am not, Antony
CLEOPATRA:
Will be himself.
MARK ANTONY:
But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
MARK ANTONY:
Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
MARK ANTONY:
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh
MARK ANTONY:
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
MARK ANTONY:
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
CLEOPATRA:
Hear the ambassadors.
MARK ANTONY:
Fie, wrangling queen!
MARK ANTONY:
Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
MARK ANTONY:
To weep, whose every passion fully strives
MARK ANTONY:
To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
MARK ANTONY:
No messenger, but thine, and all alone
MARK ANTONY:
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
MARK ANTONY:
The qualities of people. Come, my queen,
MARK ANTONY:
Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train
DEMETRIUS:
Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
PHILO:
Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
PHILO:
He comes too short of that great property
PHILO:
Which still should go with Antony.
DEMETRIUS:
I am full sorry
DEMETRIUS:
That he approves the common liar, who
DEMETRIUS:
Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
DEMETRIUS:
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
DEMETRIUS:
Exeunt
DEMETRIUS:
SCENE II. The same. Another room.
DEMETRIUS:
Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer
CHARMIAN:
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
CHARMIAN:
almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
CHARMIAN:
that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
CHARMIAN:
this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
CHARMIAN:
with garlands!
ALEXAS:
Soothsayer!
Soothsayer:
Your will?
CHARMIAN:
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
Soothsayer:
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
Soothsayer:
A little I can read.
ALEXAS:
Show him your hand.
ALEXAS:
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Bring in the banquet quickly, wine enough
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Cleopatra's health to drink.
CHARMIAN:
Good sir, give me good fortune.
Soothsayer:
I make not, but foresee.
CHARMIAN:
Pray, then, foresee me one.
Soothsayer:
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
CHARMIAN:
He means in flesh.
IRAS:
No, you shall paint when you are old.
CHARMIAN:
Wrinkles forbid!
ALEXAS:
Vex not his prescience, be attentive.
CHARMIAN:
Hush!
Soothsayer:
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
CHARMIAN:
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
ALEXAS:
Nay, hear him.
CHARMIAN:
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
CHARMIAN:
to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all
CHARMIAN:
let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
CHARMIAN:
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
CHARMIAN:
Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
Soothsayer:
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
CHARMIAN:
O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
Soothsayer:
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
Soothsayer:
Than that which is to approach.
CHARMIAN:
Then belike my children shall have no names
CHARMIAN:
prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
Soothsayer:
If every of your wishes had a womb.
Soothsayer:
And fertile every wish, a million.
CHARMIAN:
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
ALEXAS:
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
CHARMIAN:
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
ALEXAS:
We'll know all our fortunes.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
be--drunk to bed.
IRAS:
There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
CHARMIAN:
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
IRAS:
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
CHARMIAN:
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
CHARMIAN:
prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
CHARMIAN:
tell her but a worky-day fortune.
Soothsayer:
Your fortunes are alike.
IRAS:
But how, but how? give me particulars.
Soothsayer:
I have said.
IRAS:
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
CHARMIAN:
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
CHARMIAN:
I, where would you choose it?
IRAS:
Not in my husband's nose.
CHARMIAN:
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
CHARMIAN:
his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
CHARMIAN:
that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
CHARMIAN:
her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
CHARMIAN:
follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
CHARMIAN:
laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
CHARMIAN:
Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
CHARMIAN:
matter of more weight, good Isis, I beseech thee!
IRAS:
Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
IRAS:
for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
IRAS:
loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
IRAS:
foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
IRAS:
decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
CHARMIAN:
Amen.
ALEXAS:
Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
ALEXAS:
cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
ALEXAS:
they'ld do't!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Hush! here comes Antony.
CHARMIAN:
Not he, the queen.
CHARMIAN:
Enter CLEOPATRA
CLEOPATRA:
Saw you my lord?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
No, lady.
CLEOPATRA:
Was he not here?
CHARMIAN:
No, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden
CLEOPATRA:
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Madam?
CLEOPATRA:
Seek him, and bring him hither.
CLEOPATRA:
Where's Alexas?
ALEXAS:
Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
CLEOPATRA:
We will not look upon him: go with us.
CLEOPATRA:
Exeunt
CLEOPATRA:
Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants
Messenger:
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
MARK ANTONY:
Against my brother Lucius?
Messenger:
Ay
Messenger:
But soon that war had end, and the time's state
Messenger:
Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar,
Messenger:
Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,
Messenger:
Upon the first encounter, drave them.
MARK ANTONY:
Well, what worst?
Messenger:
The nature of bad news infects the teller.
MARK ANTONY:
When it concerns the fool or coward. On
MARK ANTONY:
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus
MARK ANTONY:
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
MARK ANTONY:
I hear him as he flatter'd.
Messenger:
Labienus--
Messenger:
This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,
Messenger:
Extended Asia from Euphrates,
Messenger:
His conquering banner shook from Syria
Messenger:
To Lydia and to Ionia, Whilst--
MARK ANTONY:
Antony, thou wouldst say,--
Messenger:
O, my lord!
MARK ANTONY:
Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue
MARK ANTONY:
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome,
MARK ANTONY:
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults
MARK ANTONY:
With such full licence as both truth and malice
MARK ANTONY:
Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
MARK ANTONY:
When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us
MARK ANTONY:
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
Messenger:
At your noble pleasure.
Messenger:
Exit
MARK ANTONY:
From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
First Attendant:
The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?
Second Attendant:
He stays upon your will.
MARK ANTONY:
Let him appear.
MARK ANTONY:
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
MARK ANTONY:
Or lose myself in dotage.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter another Messenger
MARK ANTONY:
What are you?
Second Messenger:
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
MARK ANTONY:
Where died she?
Second Messenger:
In Sicyon
Second Messenger:
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
Second Messenger:
Importeth thee to know, this bears.
Second Messenger:
Gives a letter
MARK ANTONY:
Forbear me.
MARK ANTONY:
Exit Second Messenger
MARK ANTONY:
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it
MARK ANTONY:
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
MARK ANTONY:
We wish it ours again, the present pleasure,
MARK ANTONY:
By revolution lowering, does become
MARK ANTONY:
The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone,
MARK ANTONY:
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
MARK ANTONY:
I must from this enchanting queen break off
MARK ANTONY:
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
MARK ANTONY:
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
MARK ANTONY:
Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What's your pleasure, sir?
MARK ANTONY:
I must with haste from hence.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Why, then, we kill all our women
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
MARK ANTONY:
I must be gone.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Under a compelling occasion, let women die, it were
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
pity to cast them away for nothing, though, between
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
this, dies instantly, I have seen her die twenty
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
MARK ANTONY:
She is cunning past man's thought.
MARK ANTONY:
Exit ALEXAS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
winds and waters sighs and tears, they are greater
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
cannot be cunning in her, if it be, she makes a
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
shower of rain as well as Jove.
MARK ANTONY:
Would I had never seen her.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
of work, which not to have been blest withal would
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
have discredited your travel.
MARK ANTONY:
Fulvia is dead.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Sir?
MARK ANTONY:
Fulvia is dead.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Fulvia!
MARK ANTONY:
Dead.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
out, there are members to make new. If there were
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
with consolation, your old smock brings forth a new
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
that should water this sorrow.
MARK ANTONY:
The business she hath broached in the state
MARK ANTONY:
Cannot endure my absence.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And the business you have broached here cannot be
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
without you, especially that of Cleopatra's, which
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
wholly depends on your abode.
MARK ANTONY:
No more light answers. Let our officers
MARK ANTONY:
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
MARK ANTONY:
The cause of our expedience to the queen,
MARK ANTONY:
And get her leave to part. For not alone
MARK ANTONY:
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
MARK ANTONY:
Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too
MARK ANTONY:
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
MARK ANTONY:
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
MARK ANTONY:
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
MARK ANTONY:
The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
MARK ANTONY:
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
MARK ANTONY:
Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
MARK ANTONY:
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
MARK ANTONY:
Upon his son, who, high in name and power,
MARK ANTONY:
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
MARK ANTONY:
For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
MARK ANTONY:
The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
MARK ANTONY:
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
MARK ANTONY:
And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
MARK ANTONY:
To such whose place is under us, requires
MARK ANTONY:
Our quick remove from hence.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I shall do't.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Exeunt
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
SCENE III. The same. Another room.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA:
Where is he?
CHARMIAN:
I did not see him since.
CLEOPATRA:
See where he is, who's with him, what he does
CLEOPATRA:
I did not send you: if you find him sad,
CLEOPATRA:
Say I am dancing, if in mirth, report
CLEOPATRA:
That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.
CLEOPATRA:
Exit ALEXAS
CHARMIAN:
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
CHARMIAN:
You do not hold the method to enforce
CHARMIAN:
The like from him.
CLEOPATRA:
What should I do, I do not?
CHARMIAN:
In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.
CLEOPATRA:
Thou teachest like a fool, the way to lose him.
CHARMIAN:
Tempt him not so too far, I wish, forbear
CHARMIAN:
In time we hate that which we often fear.
CHARMIAN:
But here comes Antony.
CHARMIAN:
Enter MARK ANTONY
CLEOPATRA:
I am sick and sullen.
MARK ANTONY:
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--
CLEOPATRA:
Help me away, dear Charmian, I shall fall
CLEOPATRA:
It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
CLEOPATRA:
Will not sustain it.
MARK ANTONY:
Now, my dearest queen,--
CLEOPATRA:
Pray you, stand further from me.
MARK ANTONY:
What's the matter?
CLEOPATRA:
I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
CLEOPATRA:
What says the married woman? You may go
CLEOPATRA:
Would she had never given you leave to come!
CLEOPATRA:
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here
CLEOPATRA:
I have no power upon you, hers you are.
MARK ANTONY:
The gods best know,--
CLEOPATRA:
O, never was there queen
CLEOPATRA:
So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
CLEOPATRA:
I saw the treasons planted.
MARK ANTONY:
Cleopatra,--
CLEOPATRA:
Why should I think you can be mine and true,
CLEOPATRA:
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
CLEOPATRA:
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
CLEOPATRA:
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
CLEOPATRA:
Which break themselves in swearing!
MARK ANTONY:
Most sweet queen,--
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
CLEOPATRA:
But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
CLEOPATRA:
Then was the time for words: no going then,
CLEOPATRA:
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
CLEOPATRA:
Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor,
CLEOPATRA:
But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
CLEOPATRA:
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
CLEOPATRA:
Art turn'd the greatest liar.
MARK ANTONY:
How now, lady!
CLEOPATRA:
I would I had thy inches, thou shouldst know
CLEOPATRA:
There were a heart in Egypt.
MARK ANTONY:
Hear me, queen
MARK ANTONY:
The strong necessity of time commands
MARK ANTONY:
Our services awhile, but my full heart
MARK ANTONY:
Remains in use with you. Our Italy
MARK ANTONY:
Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
MARK ANTONY:
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome
MARK ANTONY:
Equality of two domestic powers
MARK ANTONY:
Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
MARK ANTONY:
Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,
MARK ANTONY:
Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
MARK ANTONY:
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
MARK ANTONY:
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten,
MARK ANTONY:
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
MARK ANTONY:
By any desperate change: my more particular,
MARK ANTONY:
And that which most with you should safe my going,
MARK ANTONY:
Is Fulvia's death.
CLEOPATRA:
Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
CLEOPATRA:
It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
MARK ANTONY:
She's dead, my queen
MARK ANTONY:
Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
MARK ANTONY:
The garboils she awaked, at the last, best
MARK ANTONY:
See when and where she died.
CLEOPATRA:
O most false love!
CLEOPATRA:
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
CLEOPATRA:
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
CLEOPATRA:
In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.
MARK ANTONY:
Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
MARK ANTONY:
The purposes I bear, which are, or cease,
MARK ANTONY:
As you shall give the advice. By the fire
MARK ANTONY:
That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
MARK ANTONY:
Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
MARK ANTONY:
As thou affect'st.
CLEOPATRA:
Cut my lace, Charmian, come,
CLEOPATRA:
But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,
CLEOPATRA:
So Antony loves.
MARK ANTONY:
My precious queen, forbear,
MARK ANTONY:
And give true evidence to his love, which stands
MARK ANTONY:
An honourable trial.
CLEOPATRA:
So Fulvia told me.
CLEOPATRA:
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,
CLEOPATRA:
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
CLEOPATRA:
Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
CLEOPATRA:
Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
CLEOPATRA:
Life perfect honour.
MARK ANTONY:
You'll heat my blood: no more.
CLEOPATRA:
You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
MARK ANTONY:
Now, by my sword,--
CLEOPATRA:
And target. Still he mends,
CLEOPATRA:
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
CLEOPATRA:
How this Herculean Roman does become
CLEOPATRA:
The carriage of his chafe.
MARK ANTONY:
I'll leave you, lady.
CLEOPATRA:
Courteous lord, one word.
CLEOPATRA:
Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it
CLEOPATRA:
Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it,
CLEOPATRA:
That you know well: something it is I would,
CLEOPATRA:
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
CLEOPATRA:
And I am all forgotten.
MARK ANTONY:
But that your royalty
MARK ANTONY:
Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
MARK ANTONY:
For idleness itself.
CLEOPATRA:
'Tis sweating labour
CLEOPATRA:
To bear such idleness so near the heart
CLEOPATRA:
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,
CLEOPATRA:
Since my becomings kill me, when they do not
CLEOPATRA:
Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence,
CLEOPATRA:
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
CLEOPATRA:
And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
CLEOPATRA:
Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
CLEOPATRA:
Be strew'd before your feet!
MARK ANTONY:
Let us go. Come,
MARK ANTONY:
Our separation so abides, and flies,
MARK ANTONY:
That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
MARK ANTONY:
And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their Train
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Our great competitor: from Alexandria
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The lamps of night in revel, is not more man-like
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
More womanly than he, hardly gave audience, or
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
A man who is the abstract of all faults
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That all men follow.
LEPIDUS:
I must not think there are
LEPIDUS:
Evils enow to darken all his goodness
LEPIDUS:
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
LEPIDUS:
More fiery by night's blackness, hereditary,
LEPIDUS:
Rather than purchased, what he cannot change,
LEPIDUS:
Than what he chooses.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
becomes him,--
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
As his composure must be rare indeed
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Call on him for't: but to confound such time,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And so rebel to judgment.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter a Messenger
LEPIDUS:
Here's more news.
Messenger:
Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,
Messenger:
Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
Messenger:
How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
Messenger:
And it appears he is beloved of those
Messenger:
That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
Messenger:
The discontents repair, and men's reports
Messenger:
Give him much wrong'd.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I should have known no less.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
It hath been taught us from the primal state,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That he which is was wish'd until he were,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To rot itself with motion.
Messenger:
Caesar, I bring thee word,
Messenger:
Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
Messenger:
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
Messenger:
With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
Messenger:
They make in Italy, the borders maritime
Messenger:
Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt
Messenger:
No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
Messenger:
Taken as seen, for Pompey's name strikes more
Messenger:
Than could his war resisted.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Antony,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Though daintily brought up, with patience more
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The barks of trees thou browsed'st, on the Alps
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Which some did die to look on: and all this--
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
So much as lank'd not.
LEPIDUS:
'Tis pity of him.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Let his shames quickly
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Did show ourselves i' the field, and to that end
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Thrives in our idleness.
LEPIDUS:
To-morrow, Caesar,
LEPIDUS:
I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
LEPIDUS:
Both what by sea and land I can be able
LEPIDUS:
To front this present time.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Till which encounter,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
It is my business too. Farewell.
LEPIDUS:
Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime
LEPIDUS:
Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
LEPIDUS:
To let me be partaker.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Doubt not, sir,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I knew it for my bond.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exeunt
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA:
Charmian!
CHARMIAN:
Madam?
CLEOPATRA:
Ha, ha!
CLEOPATRA:
Give me to drink mandragora.
CHARMIAN:
Why, madam?
CLEOPATRA:
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
CLEOPATRA:
My Antony is away.
CHARMIAN:
You think of him too much.
CLEOPATRA:
O, 'tis treason!
CHARMIAN:
Madam, I trust, not so.
CLEOPATRA:
Thou, eunuch Mardian!
MARDIAN:
What's your highness' pleasure?
CLEOPATRA:
Not now to hear thee sing, I take no pleasure
CLEOPATRA:
In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,
CLEOPATRA:
That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
CLEOPATRA:
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
MARDIAN:
Yes, gracious madam.
CLEOPATRA:
Indeed!
MARDIAN:
Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing
MARDIAN:
But what indeed is honest to be done
MARDIAN:
Yet have I fierce affections, and think
MARDIAN:
What Venus did with Mars.
CLEOPATRA:
O Charmian,
CLEOPATRA:
Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
CLEOPATRA:
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
CLEOPATRA:
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
CLEOPATRA:
Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?
CLEOPATRA:
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
CLEOPATRA:
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
CLEOPATRA:
Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
CLEOPATRA:
For so he calls me: now I feed myself
CLEOPATRA:
With most delicious poison. Think on me,
CLEOPATRA:
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
CLEOPATRA:
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
CLEOPATRA:
When thou wast here above the ground, I was
CLEOPATRA:
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
CLEOPATRA:
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow,
CLEOPATRA:
There would he anchor his aspect and die
CLEOPATRA:
With looking on his life.
CLEOPATRA:
Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR
ALEXAS:
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
CLEOPATRA:
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
CLEOPATRA:
Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
CLEOPATRA:
With his tinct gilded thee.
CLEOPATRA:
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
ALEXAS:
Last thing he did, dear queen,
ALEXAS:
He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--
ALEXAS:
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
CLEOPATRA:
Mine ear must pluck it thence.
ALEXAS:
'Good friend,' quoth he,
ALEXAS:
'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
ALEXAS:
This treasure of an oyster, at whose foot,
ALEXAS:
To mend the petty present, I will piece
ALEXAS:
Her opulent throne with kingdoms, all the east,
ALEXAS:
Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
ALEXAS:
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
ALEXAS:
Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke
ALEXAS:
Was beastly dumb'd by him.
CLEOPATRA:
What, was he sad or merry?
ALEXAS:
Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
ALEXAS:
Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
CLEOPATRA:
O well-divided disposition! Note him,
CLEOPATRA:
Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man, but note him
CLEOPATRA:
He was not sad, for he would shine on those
CLEOPATRA:
That make their looks by his, he was not merry,
CLEOPATRA:
Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
CLEOPATRA:
In Egypt with his joy, but between both
CLEOPATRA:
O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
CLEOPATRA:
The violence of either thee becomes,
CLEOPATRA:
So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
ALEXAS:
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers
ALEXAS:
Why do you send so thick?
CLEOPATRA:
Who's born that day
CLEOPATRA:
When I forget to send to Antony,
CLEOPATRA:
Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
CLEOPATRA:
Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
CLEOPATRA:
Ever love Caesar so?
CHARMIAN:
O that brave Caesar!
CLEOPATRA:
Be choked with such another emphasis!
CLEOPATRA:
Say, the brave Antony.
CHARMIAN:
The valiant Caesar!
CLEOPATRA:
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
CLEOPATRA:
If thou with Caesar paragon again
CLEOPATRA:
My man of men.
CHARMIAN:
By your most gracious pardon,
CHARMIAN:
I sing but after you.
CLEOPATRA:
My salad days,
CLEOPATRA:
When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,
CLEOPATRA:
To say as I said then! But, come, away,
CLEOPATRA:
Get me ink and paper
CLEOPATRA:
He shall have every day a several greeting,
CLEOPATRA:
Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
CLEOPATRA:
Exeunt
CLEOPATRA:
ACT II
CLEOPATRA:
SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.
CLEOPATRA:
Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner
POMPEY:
If the great gods be just, they shall assist
POMPEY:
The deeds of justest men.
MENECRATES:
Know, worthy Pompey,
MENECRATES:
That what they do delay, they not deny.
POMPEY:
Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
POMPEY:
The thing we sue for.
MENECRATES:
We, ignorant of ourselves,
MENECRATES:
Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
MENECRATES:
Deny us for our good, so find we profit
MENECRATES:
By losing of our prayers.
POMPEY:
I shall do well
POMPEY:
The people love me, and the sea is mine,
POMPEY:
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
POMPEY:
Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
POMPEY:
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
POMPEY:
No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
POMPEY:
He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
POMPEY:
Of both is flatter'd, but he neither loves,
POMPEY:
Nor either cares for him.
MENAS:
Caesar and Lepidus
MENAS:
Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
POMPEY:
Where have you this? 'tis false.
MENAS:
From Silvius, sir.
POMPEY:
He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,
POMPEY:
Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
POMPEY:
Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
POMPEY:
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
POMPEY:
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
POMPEY:
Keep his brain fuming, Epicurean cooks
POMPEY:
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
POMPEY:
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
POMPEY:
Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
POMPEY:
Enter VARRIUS
POMPEY:
How now, Varrius!
VARRIUS:
This is most certain that I shall deliver
VARRIUS:
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
VARRIUS:
Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
VARRIUS:
A space for further travel.
POMPEY:
I could have given less matter
POMPEY:
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
POMPEY:
This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
POMPEY:
For such a petty war: his soldiership
POMPEY:
Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
POMPEY:
The higher our opinion, that our stirring
POMPEY:
Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
POMPEY:
The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
MENAS:
I cannot hope
MENAS:
Caesar and Antony shall well greet together
MENAS:
His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar,
MENAS:
His brother warr'd upon him, although, I think,
MENAS:
Not moved by Antony.
POMPEY:
I know not, Menas,
POMPEY:
How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
POMPEY:
Were't not that we stand up against them all,
POMPEY:
'Twere pregnant they should square between
POMPEY:
themselves,
POMPEY:
For they have entertained cause enough
POMPEY:
To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
POMPEY:
May cement their divisions and bind up
POMPEY:
The petty difference, we yet not know.
POMPEY:
Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
POMPEY:
Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
POMPEY:
Come, Menas.
POMPEY:
Exeunt
POMPEY:
SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.
POMPEY:
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
LEPIDUS:
Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
LEPIDUS:
And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
LEPIDUS:
To soft and gentle speech.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I shall entreat him
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Let Antony look over Caesar's head
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I would not shave't to-day.
LEPIDUS:
'Tis not a time
LEPIDUS:
For private stomaching.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Every time
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
LEPIDUS:
But small to greater matters must give way.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Not if the small come first.
LEPIDUS:
Your speech is passion
LEPIDUS:
But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
LEPIDUS:
The noble Antony.
LEPIDUS:
Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And yonder, Caesar.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA
MARK ANTONY:
If we compose well here, to Parthia
MARK ANTONY:
Hark, Ventidius.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I do not know,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Mecaenas, ask Agrippa.
LEPIDUS:
Noble friends,
LEPIDUS:
That which combined us was most great, and let not
LEPIDUS:
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
LEPIDUS:
May it be gently heard: when we debate
LEPIDUS:
Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
LEPIDUS:
Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,
LEPIDUS:
The rather, for I earnestly beseech,
LEPIDUS:
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
LEPIDUS:
Nor curstness grow to the matter.
MARK ANTONY:
'Tis spoken well.
MARK ANTONY:
Were we before our armies, and to fight.
MARK ANTONY:
I should do thus.
MARK ANTONY:
Flourish
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Welcome to Rome.
MARK ANTONY:
Thank you.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Sit.
MARK ANTONY:
Sit, sir.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Nay, then.
MARK ANTONY:
I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
MARK ANTONY:
Or being, concern you not.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I must be laugh'd at,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
If, or for nothing or a little, I
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Should say myself offended, and with you
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Chiefly i' the world, more laugh'd at, that I should
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Once name you derogately, when to sound your name
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
It not concern'd me.
MARK ANTONY:
My being in Egypt, Caesar,
MARK ANTONY:
What was't to you?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
No more than my residing here at Rome
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Might be my question.
MARK ANTONY:
How intend you, practised?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Made wars upon me, and their contestation
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Was theme for you, you were the word of war.
MARK ANTONY:
You do mistake your business, my brother never
MARK ANTONY:
Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it,
MARK ANTONY:
And have my learning from some true reports,
MARK ANTONY:
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
MARK ANTONY:
Discredit my authority with yours,
MARK ANTONY:
And make the wars alike against my stomach,
MARK ANTONY:
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
MARK ANTONY:
Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
MARK ANTONY:
As matter whole you have not to make it with,
MARK ANTONY:
It must not be with this.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You praise yourself
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
By laying defects of judgment to me, but
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You patch'd up your excuses.
MARK ANTONY:
Not so, not so,
MARK ANTONY:
I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
MARK ANTONY:
Very necessity of this thought, that I,
MARK ANTONY:
Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
MARK ANTONY:
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
MARK ANTONY:
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
MARK ANTONY:
I would you had her spirit in such another
MARK ANTONY:
The third o' the world is yours, which with a snaffle
MARK ANTONY:
You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Would we had all such wives, that the men might go
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
to wars with the women!
MARK ANTONY:
So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar
MARK ANTONY:
Made out of her impatience, which not wanted
MARK ANTONY:
Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant
MARK ANTONY:
Did you too much disquiet: for that you must
MARK ANTONY:
But say, I could not help it.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I wrote to you
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
When rioting in Alexandria, you
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Did gibe my missive out of audience.
MARK ANTONY:
Sir,
MARK ANTONY:
He fell upon me ere admitted: then
MARK ANTONY:
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
MARK ANTONY:
Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
MARK ANTONY:
I told him of myself, which was as much
MARK ANTONY:
As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
MARK ANTONY:
Be nothing of our strife, if we contend,
MARK ANTONY:
Out of our question wipe him.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You have broken
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The article of your oath, which you shall never
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Have tongue to charge me with.
LEPIDUS:
Soft, Caesar!
MARK ANTONY:
No,
MARK ANTONY:
Lepidus, let him speak
MARK ANTONY:
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
MARK ANTONY:
Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar,
MARK ANTONY:
The article of my oath.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To lend me arms and aid when I required them,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The which you both denied.
MARK ANTONY:
Neglected, rather,
MARK ANTONY:
And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
MARK ANTONY:
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
MARK ANTONY:
I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
MARK ANTONY:
Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
MARK ANTONY:
Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
MARK ANTONY:
To have me out of Egypt, made wars here,
MARK ANTONY:
For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
MARK ANTONY:
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
MARK ANTONY:
To stoop in such a case.
LEPIDUS:
'Tis noble spoken.
MECAENAS:
If it might please you, to enforce no further
MECAENAS:
The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
MECAENAS:
Were to remember that the present need
MECAENAS:
Speaks to atone you.
LEPIDUS:
Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Or, if you borrow one another's love for the
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
MARK ANTONY:
Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
MARK ANTONY:
You wrong this presence, therefore speak no more.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Go to, then, your considerate stone.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I do not much dislike the matter, but
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The manner of his speech, for't cannot be
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
O' the world I would pursue it.
AGRIPPA:
Give me leave, Caesar,--
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Speak, Agrippa.
AGRIPPA:
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
AGRIPPA:
Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
AGRIPPA:
Is now a widower.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Say not so, Agrippa
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Were well deserved of rashness.
MARK ANTONY:
I am not married, Caesar: let me hear
MARK ANTONY:
Agrippa further speak.
AGRIPPA:
To hold you in perpetual amity,
AGRIPPA:
To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
AGRIPPA:
With an unslipping  knot, take Antony
AGRIPPA:
Octavia to his wife, whose beauty claims
AGRIPPA:
No worse a husband than the best of men,
AGRIPPA:
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
AGRIPPA:
That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
AGRIPPA:
All little jealousies, which now seem great,
AGRIPPA:
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
AGRIPPA:
Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
AGRIPPA:
Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
AGRIPPA:
Would, each to other and all loves to both,
AGRIPPA:
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,
AGRIPPA:
For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
AGRIPPA:
By duty ruminated.
MARK ANTONY:
Will Caesar speak?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
With what is spoke already.
MARK ANTONY:
What power is in Agrippa,
MARK ANTONY:
If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
MARK ANTONY:
To make this good?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The power of Caesar, and
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
His power unto Octavia.
MARK ANTONY:
May I never
MARK ANTONY:
To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
MARK ANTONY:
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand
MARK ANTONY:
Further this act of grace: and from this hour
MARK ANTONY:
The heart of brothers govern in our loves
MARK ANTONY:
And sway our great designs!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
There is my hand.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Did ever love so dearly: let her live
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Fly off our loves again!
LEPIDUS:
Happily, amen!
MARK ANTONY:
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey,
MARK ANTONY:
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
MARK ANTONY:
Of late upon me: I must thank him only,
MARK ANTONY:
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report,
MARK ANTONY:
At heel of that, defy him.
LEPIDUS:
Time calls upon's
LEPIDUS:
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
LEPIDUS:
Or else he seeks out us.
MARK ANTONY:
Where lies he?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
About the mount Misenum.
MARK ANTONY:
What is his strength by land?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Great and increasing: but by sea
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
He is an absolute master.
MARK ANTONY:
So is the fame.
MARK ANTONY:
Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it
MARK ANTONY:
Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
MARK ANTONY:
The business we have talk'd of.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
With most gladness
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And do invite you to my sister's view,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Whither straight I'll lead you.
MARK ANTONY:
Let us, Lepidus,
MARK ANTONY:
Not lack your company.
LEPIDUS:
Noble Antony,
LEPIDUS:
Not sickness should detain me.
LEPIDUS:
Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, and LEPIDUS
MECAENAS:
Welcome from Egypt, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
honourable friend, Agrippa!
AGRIPPA:
Good Enobarbus!
MECAENAS:
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
MECAENAS:
digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance, and
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
made the night light with drinking.
MECAENAS:
Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and
MECAENAS:
but twelve persons there, is this true?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
MECAENAS:
She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to
MECAENAS:
her.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
AGRIPPA:
There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised
AGRIPPA:
well for her.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I will tell you.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The water which they beat to follow faster,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
It beggar'd all description: she did lie
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And what they undid did.
AGRIPPA:
O, rare for Antony!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And made their bends adornings: at the helm
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That yarely frame the office. From the barge
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Her people out upon her, and Antony,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Whistling to the air, which, but for vacancy,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And made a gap in nature.
AGRIPPA:
Rare Egyptian!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Invited her to supper: she replied,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
It should be better he became her guest,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And for his ordinary pays his heart
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
For what his eyes eat only.
AGRIPPA:
Royal wench!
AGRIPPA:
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed
AGRIPPA:
He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I saw her once
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Hop forty paces through the public street,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That she did make defect perfection,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And, breathless, power breathe forth.
MECAENAS:
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Never, he will not
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Her infinite variety: other women cloy
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Where most she satisfies, for vilest things
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Bless her when she is riggish.
MECAENAS:
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
MECAENAS:
The heart of Antony, Octavia is
MECAENAS:
A blessed lottery to him.
AGRIPPA:
Let us go.
AGRIPPA:
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
AGRIPPA:
Whilst you abide here.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Humbly, sir, I thank you.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Exeunt
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them, and Attendants
MARK ANTONY:
The world and my great office will sometimes
MARK ANTONY:
Divide me from your bosom.
OCTAVIA:
All which time
OCTAVIA:
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
OCTAVIA:
To them for you.
MARK ANTONY:
Good night, sir. My Octavia,
MARK ANTONY:
Read not my blemishes in the world's report
MARK ANTONY:
I have not kept my square, but that to come
MARK ANTONY:
Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.
MARK ANTONY:
Good night, sir.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Good night.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter Soothsayer
MARK ANTONY:
Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
Soothsayer:
Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!
MARK ANTONY:
If you can, your reason?
Soothsayer:
I see it in
Soothsayer:
My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
Soothsayer:
Hie you to Egypt again.
MARK ANTONY:
Say to me,
MARK ANTONY:
Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
Soothsayer:
Caesar's.
Soothsayer:
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side
Soothsayer:
Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is
Soothsayer:
Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,
Soothsayer:
Where Caesar's is not, but, near him, thy angel
Soothsayer:
Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore
Soothsayer:
Make space enough between you.
MARK ANTONY:
Speak this no more.
Soothsayer:
To none but thee, no more, but when to thee.
Soothsayer:
If thou dost play with him at any game,
Soothsayer:
Thou art sure to lose, and, of that natural luck,
Soothsayer:
He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,
Soothsayer:
When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit
Soothsayer:
Is all afraid to govern thee near him,
Soothsayer:
But, he away, 'tis noble.
MARK ANTONY:
Get thee gone
MARK ANTONY:
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him
MARK ANTONY:
Exit Soothsayer
MARK ANTONY:
He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
MARK ANTONY:
He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him,
MARK ANTONY:
And in our sports my better cunning faints
MARK ANTONY:
Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds,
MARK ANTONY:
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
MARK ANTONY:
When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
MARK ANTONY:
Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt
MARK ANTONY:
And though I make this marriage for my peace,
MARK ANTONY:
I' the east my pleasure lies.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter VENTIDIUS
MARK ANTONY:
O, come, Ventidius,
MARK ANTONY:
You must to Parthia: your commission's ready,
MARK ANTONY:
Follow me, and receive't.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE IV. The same. A street.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter LEPIDUS, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA
LEPIDUS:
Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
LEPIDUS:
Your generals after.
AGRIPPA:
Sir, Mark Antony
AGRIPPA:
Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
LEPIDUS:
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
LEPIDUS:
Which will become you both, farewell.
MECAENAS:
We shall,
MECAENAS:
As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
MECAENAS:
Before you, Lepidus.
LEPIDUS:
Your way is shorter,
LEPIDUS:
My purposes do draw me much about
LEPIDUS:
You'll win two days upon me.
AGRIPPA:
Sir, good success!
LEPIDUS:
Farewell.
LEPIDUS:
Exeunt
LEPIDUS:
SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
LEPIDUS:
Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA:
Give me some music, music, moody food
CLEOPATRA:
Of us that trade in love.
Attendants:
The music, ho!
Attendants:
Enter MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA:
Let it alone, let's to billiards: come, Charmian.
CHARMIAN:
My arm is sore, best play with Mardian.
CLEOPATRA:
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
CLEOPATRA:
As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
MARDIAN:
As well as I can, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
And when good will is show'd, though't come
CLEOPATRA:
too short,
CLEOPATRA:
The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now
CLEOPATRA:
Give me mine angle, we'll to the river: there,
CLEOPATRA:
My music playing far off, I will betray
CLEOPATRA:
Tawny-finn'd fishes, my bended hook shall pierce
CLEOPATRA:
Their slimy jaws, and, as I draw them up,
CLEOPATRA:
I'll think them every one an Antony,
CLEOPATRA:
And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'
CHARMIAN:
'Twas merry when
CHARMIAN:
You wager'd on your angling, when your diver
CHARMIAN:
Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
CHARMIAN:
With fervency drew up.
CLEOPATRA:
That time,--O times!--
CLEOPATRA:
I laugh'd him out of patience, and that night
CLEOPATRA:
I laugh'd him into patience, and next morn,
CLEOPATRA:
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
CLEOPATRA:
Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
CLEOPATRA:
I wore his sword Philippan.
CLEOPATRA:
Enter a Messenger
CLEOPATRA:
O, from Italy
CLEOPATRA:
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
CLEOPATRA:
That long time have been barren.
Messenger:
Madam, madam,--
CLEOPATRA:
Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,
CLEOPATRA:
Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,
CLEOPATRA:
If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
CLEOPATRA:
My bluest veins to kiss, a hand that kings
CLEOPATRA:
Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
Messenger:
First, madam, he is well.
CLEOPATRA:
Why, there's more gold.
CLEOPATRA:
But, sirrah, mark, we use
CLEOPATRA:
To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
CLEOPATRA:
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
CLEOPATRA:
Down thy ill-uttering throat.
Messenger:
Good madam, hear me.
CLEOPATRA:
Well, go to, I will,
CLEOPATRA:
But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
CLEOPATRA:
Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour
CLEOPATRA:
To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
CLEOPATRA:
Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
CLEOPATRA:
Not like a formal man.
Messenger:
Will't please you hear me?
CLEOPATRA:
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st
CLEOPATRA:
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
CLEOPATRA:
Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
CLEOPATRA:
I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
CLEOPATRA:
Rich pearls upon thee.
Messenger:
Madam, he's well.
CLEOPATRA:
Well said.
Messenger:
And friends with Caesar.
CLEOPATRA:
Thou'rt an honest man.
Messenger:
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
CLEOPATRA:
Make thee a fortune from me.
Messenger:
But yet, madam,--
CLEOPATRA:
I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
CLEOPATRA:
The good precedence, fie upon 'But yet'!
CLEOPATRA:
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
CLEOPATRA:
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
CLEOPATRA:
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
CLEOPATRA:
The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar
CLEOPATRA:
In state of health thou say'st, and thou say'st free.
Messenger:
Free, madam! no, I made no such report
Messenger:
He's bound unto Octavia.
CLEOPATRA:
For what good turn?
Messenger:
For the best turn i' the bed.
CLEOPATRA:
I am pale, Charmian.
Messenger:
Madam, he's married to Octavia.
CLEOPATRA:
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
CLEOPATRA:
Strikes him down
Messenger:
Good madam, patience.
CLEOPATRA:
What say you? Hence,
CLEOPATRA:
Strikes him again
CLEOPATRA:
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
CLEOPATRA:
Like balls before me, I'll unhair thy head
CLEOPATRA:
She hales him up and down
CLEOPATRA:
Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
CLEOPATRA:
Smarting in lingering pickle.
Messenger:
Gracious madam,
Messenger:
I that do bring the news made not the match.
CLEOPATRA:
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
CLEOPATRA:
And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
CLEOPATRA:
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage,
CLEOPATRA:
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
CLEOPATRA:
Thy modesty can beg.
Messenger:
He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
Rogue, thou hast lived too long.
CLEOPATRA:
Draws a knife
Messenger:
Nay, then I'll run.
Messenger:
What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
Messenger:
Exit
CHARMIAN:
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself
CHARMIAN:
The man is innocent.
CLEOPATRA:
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
CLEOPATRA:
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
CLEOPATRA:
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again
CLEOPATRA:
Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.
CHARMIAN:
He is afeard to come.
CLEOPATRA:
I will not hurt him.
CLEOPATRA:
Exit CHARMIAN
CLEOPATRA:
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
CLEOPATRA:
A meaner than myself, since I myself
CLEOPATRA:
Have given myself the cause.
CLEOPATRA:
Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger
CLEOPATRA:
Come hither, sir.
CLEOPATRA:
Though it be honest, it is never good
CLEOPATRA:
To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
CLEOPATRA:
An host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell
CLEOPATRA:
Themselves when they be felt.
Messenger:
I have done my duty.
CLEOPATRA:
Is he married?
CLEOPATRA:
I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
CLEOPATRA:
If thou again say 'Yes.'
Messenger:
He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?
Messenger:
Should I lie, madam?
CLEOPATRA:
O, I would thou didst,
CLEOPATRA:
So half my Egypt were submerged and made
CLEOPATRA:
A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence
CLEOPATRA:
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
CLEOPATRA:
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
Messenger:
I crave your highness' pardon.
CLEOPATRA:
He is married?
Messenger:
Take no offence that I would not offend you
Messenger:
To punish me for what you make me do.
Messenger:
Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.
CLEOPATRA:
O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
CLEOPATRA:
That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence
CLEOPATRA:
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
CLEOPATRA:
Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,
CLEOPATRA:
And be undone by 'em!
CLEOPATRA:
Exit Messenger
CHARMIAN:
Good your highness, patience.
CLEOPATRA:
In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
CHARMIAN:
Many times, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
I am paid for't now.
CLEOPATRA:
Lead me from hence
CLEOPATRA:
I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.
CLEOPATRA:
Go to the fellow, good Alexas, bid him
CLEOPATRA:
Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
CLEOPATRA:
Her inclination, let him not leave out
CLEOPATRA:
The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
CLEOPATRA:
Exit ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA:
Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,
CLEOPATRA:
Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
CLEOPATRA:
The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas
CLEOPATRA:
To MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA:
Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
CLEOPATRA:
But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.
CLEOPATRA:
Exeunt
CLEOPATRA:
SCENE VI. Near Misenum.
CLEOPATRA:
Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,  with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR,  MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marching
POMPEY:
Your hostages I have, so have you mine,
POMPEY:
And we shall talk before we fight.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Most meet
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That first we come to words, and therefore have we
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Our written purposes before us sent,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That else must perish here.
POMPEY:
To you all three,
POMPEY:
The senators alone of this great world,
POMPEY:
Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
POMPEY:
Wherefore my father should revengers want,
POMPEY:
Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,
POMPEY:
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
POMPEY:
There saw you labouring for him. What was't
POMPEY:
That moved pale Cassius to conspire, and what
POMPEY:
Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
POMPEY:
With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,
POMPEY:
To drench the Capitol, but that they would
POMPEY:
Have one man but a man? And that is it
POMPEY:
Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burthen
POMPEY:
The anger'd ocean foams, with which I meant
POMPEY:
To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
POMPEY:
Cast on my noble father.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Take your time.
MARK ANTONY:
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails,
MARK ANTONY:
We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
MARK ANTONY:
How much we do o'er-count thee.
POMPEY:
At land, indeed,
POMPEY:
Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house
POMPEY:
But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
POMPEY:
Remain in't as thou mayst.
LEPIDUS:
Be pleased to tell us--
LEPIDUS:
For this is from the present--how you take
LEPIDUS:
The offers we have sent you.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
There's the point.
MARK ANTONY:
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
MARK ANTONY:
What it is worth embraced.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And what may follow,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To try a larger fortune.
POMPEY:
You have made me offer
POMPEY:
Of Sicily, Sardinia, and I must
POMPEY:
Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send
POMPEY:
Measures of wheat to Rome, this 'greed upon
POMPEY:
To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
POMPEY:
Our targes undinted.
LEPIDUS:
That's our offer.
POMPEY:
Know, then,
POMPEY:
I came before you here a man prepared
POMPEY:
To take this offer: but Mark Antony
POMPEY:
Put me to some impatience: though I lose
POMPEY:
The praise of it by telling, you must know,
POMPEY:
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
POMPEY:
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
POMPEY:
Her welcome friendly.
MARK ANTONY:
I have heard it, Pompey,
MARK ANTONY:
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
MARK ANTONY:
Which I do owe you.
POMPEY:
Let me have your hand
POMPEY:
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
MARK ANTONY:
The beds i' the east are soft, and thanks to you,
MARK ANTONY:
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither,
MARK ANTONY:
For I have gain'd by 't.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Since I saw you last,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
There is a change upon you.
POMPEY:
Well, I know not
POMPEY:
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face,
POMPEY:
But in my bosom shall she never come,
POMPEY:
To make my heart her vassal.
LEPIDUS:
Well met here.
POMPEY:
I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed
POMPEY:
I crave our composition may be written,
POMPEY:
And seal'd between us.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That's the next to do.
POMPEY:
We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
POMPEY:
Draw lots who shall begin.
MARK ANTONY:
That will I, Pompey.
POMPEY:
No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
POMPEY:
Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
POMPEY:
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
POMPEY:
Grew fat with feasting there.
MARK ANTONY:
You have heard much.
POMPEY:
I have fair meanings, sir.
MARK ANTONY:
And fair words to them.
POMPEY:
Then so much have I heard
POMPEY:
And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
No more of that: he did so.
POMPEY:
What, I pray you?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
POMPEY:
I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Well,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And well am like to do, for, I perceive,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Four feasts are toward.
POMPEY:
Let me shake thy hand,
POMPEY:
I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
POMPEY:
When I have envied thy behavior.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Sir,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I never loved you much, but I ha' praised ye,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
When you have well deserved ten times as much
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
As I have said you did.
POMPEY:
Enjoy thy plainness,
POMPEY:
It nothing ill becomes thee.
POMPEY:
Aboard my galley I invite you all
POMPEY:
Will you lead, lords?
LEPIDUS:
Show us the way, sir.
POMPEY:
Come.
POMPEY:
Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS
MENAS:
[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
MENAS:
made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
At sea, I think.
MENAS:
We have, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
You have done well by water.
MENAS:
And you by land.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I will praise any man that will praise me, though it
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
cannot be denied what I have done by land.
MENAS:
Nor what I have done by water.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Yes, something you can deny for your own
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
MENAS:
And you by land.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
There I deny my land service. But give me your
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
might take two thieves kissing.
MENAS:
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
MENAS:
No slander, they steal hearts.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
We came hither to fight with you.
MENAS:
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
MENAS:
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.
MENAS:
You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
MENAS:
here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
MENAS:
True, sir, she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
MENAS:
Pray ye, sir?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
'Tis true.
MENAS:
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
not prophesy so.
MENAS:
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
MENAS:
marriage than the love of the parties.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
holy, cold, and still conversation.
MENAS:
Who would not have his wife so?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I said before, that which is the strength of their
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
he married but his occasion here.
MENAS:
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
MENAS:
I have a health for you.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
MENAS:
Come, let's away.
MENAS:
Exeunt
MENAS:
SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.
MENAS:
Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet
First Servant:
Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
First Servant:
ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
First Servant:
will blow them down.
Second Servant:
Lepidus is high-coloured.
First Servant:
They have made him drink alms-drink.
Second Servant:
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
Second Servant:
cries out 'No more,' reconciles them to his
Second Servant:
entreaty, and himself to the drink.
First Servant:
But it raises the greater war between him and
First Servant:
his discretion.
Second Servant:
Why, this is to have a name in great men's
Second Servant:
fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
Second Servant:
me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
First Servant:
To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
First Servant:
to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
First Servant:
which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
First Servant:
A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK  ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains
MARK ANTONY:
[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]  Thus do they, sir: they take
MARK ANTONY:
the flow o' the Nile
MARK ANTONY:
By certain scales i' the pyramid, they know,
MARK ANTONY:
By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
MARK ANTONY:
Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
MARK ANTONY:
The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
MARK ANTONY:
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
MARK ANTONY:
And shortly comes to harvest.
LEPIDUS:
You've strange serpents there.
MARK ANTONY:
Ay, Lepidus.
LEPIDUS:
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
LEPIDUS:
operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.
MARK ANTONY:
They are so.
POMPEY:
Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
LEPIDUS:
I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Not till you have slept, I fear me you'll be in till then.
LEPIDUS:
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
LEPIDUS:
pyramises are very goodly things, without
LEPIDUS:
contradiction, I have heard that.
MENAS:
[Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey, a word.
POMPEY:
[Aside to MENAS]                 Say in mine ear
POMPEY:
what is't?
MENAS:
[Aside to POMPEY]  Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
MENAS:
thee, captain,
MENAS:
And hear me speak a word.
POMPEY:
[Aside to MENAS]  Forbear me till anon.
POMPEY:
This wine for Lepidus!
LEPIDUS:
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
MARK ANTONY:
It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad
MARK ANTONY:
as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
MARK ANTONY:
and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
MARK ANTONY:
which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of
MARK ANTONY:
it, it transmigrates.
LEPIDUS:
What colour is it of?
MARK ANTONY:
Of it own colour too.
LEPIDUS:
'Tis a strange serpent.
MARK ANTONY:
'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Will this description satisfy him?
MARK ANTONY:
With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a
MARK ANTONY:
very epicure.
POMPEY:
[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
POMPEY:
that? away!
POMPEY:
Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
MENAS:
[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thou
MENAS:
wilt hear me,
MENAS:
Rise from thy stool.
POMPEY:
[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.
POMPEY:
The matter?
POMPEY:
Rises, and walks aside
MENAS:
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
POMPEY:
Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
POMPEY:
Be jolly, lords.
MARK ANTONY:
These quick-sands, Lepidus,
MARK ANTONY:
Keep off them, for you sink.
MENAS:
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
POMPEY:
What say'st thou?
MENAS:
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
POMPEY:
How should that be?
MENAS:
But entertain it,
MENAS:
And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
MENAS:
Will give thee all the world.
POMPEY:
Hast thou drunk well?
MENAS:
Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
MENAS:
Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove
MENAS:
Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
MENAS:
Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
POMPEY:
Show me which way.
MENAS:
These three world-sharers, these competitors,
MENAS:
Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable,
MENAS:
And, when we are put off, fall to their throats
MENAS:
All there is thine.
POMPEY:
Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
POMPEY:
And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany,
POMPEY:
In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
POMPEY:
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour,
POMPEY:
Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
POMPEY:
Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
POMPEY:
I should have found it afterwards well done,
POMPEY:
But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
MENAS:
[Aside]  For this,
MENAS:
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
MENAS:
Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
MENAS:
Shall never find it more.
POMPEY:
This health to Lepidus!
MARK ANTONY:
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Here's to thee, Menas!
MENAS:
Enobarbus, welcome!
POMPEY:
Fill till the cup be hid.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
There's a strong fellow, Menas.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS
MENAS:
Why?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A' bears the third part of the world, man, see'st
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
not?
MENAS:
The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
MENAS:
That it might go on wheels!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Drink thou, increase the reels.
MENAS:
Come.
POMPEY:
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
MARK ANTONY:
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
MARK ANTONY:
Here is to Caesar!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I could well forbear't.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And it grows fouler.
MARK ANTONY:
Be a child o' the time.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Possess it, I'll make answer
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
But I had rather fast from all four days
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Than drink so much in one.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ha, my brave emperor!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
To MARK ANTONY
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And celebrate our drink?
POMPEY:
Let's ha't, good soldier.
MARK ANTONY:
Come, let's all take hands,
MARK ANTONY:
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
MARK ANTONY:
In soft and delicate Lethe.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
All take hands.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Make battery to our ears with the loud music
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The holding every man shall bear as loud
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
As his strong sides can volley.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
THE SONG.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Come, thou monarch of the vine,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Cup us, till the world go round,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Cup us, till the world go round!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Let me request you off: our graver business
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Good Antony, your hand.
POMPEY:
I'll try you on the shore.
MARK ANTONY:
And shall, sir, give's your hand.
POMPEY:
O Antony,
POMPEY:
You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
POMPEY:
Come, down into the boat.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Take heed you fall not.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Menas, I'll not on shore.
MENAS:
No, to my cabin.
MENAS:
These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
MENAS:
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
MENAS:
To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!
MENAS:
Sound a flourish, with drums
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ho! says a' There's my cap.
MENAS:
Ho! Noble captain, come.
MENAS:
Exeunt
MENAS:
ACT III
MENAS:
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.
MENAS:
Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,  and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers, the dead body of PACORUS borne before him
VENTIDIUS:
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
VENTIDIUS:
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
VENTIDIUS:
Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
VENTIDIUS:
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
VENTIDIUS:
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
SILIUS:
Noble Ventidius,
SILIUS:
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
SILIUS:
The fugitive Parthians follow, spur through Media,
SILIUS:
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
SILIUS:
The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
SILIUS:
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
SILIUS:
Put garlands on thy head.
VENTIDIUS:
O Silius, Silius,
VENTIDIUS:
I have done enough, a lower place, note well,
VENTIDIUS:
May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius,
VENTIDIUS:
Better to leave undone, than by our deed
VENTIDIUS:
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
VENTIDIUS:
Caesar and Antony have ever won
VENTIDIUS:
More in their officer than person: Sossius,
VENTIDIUS:
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
VENTIDIUS:
For quick accumulation of renown,
VENTIDIUS:
Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
VENTIDIUS:
Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
VENTIDIUS:
Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
VENTIDIUS:
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
VENTIDIUS:
Than gain which darkens him.
VENTIDIUS:
I could do more to do Antonius good,
VENTIDIUS:
But 'twould offend him, and in his offence
VENTIDIUS:
Should my performance perish.
SILIUS:
Thou hast, Ventidius,
SILIUS:
that
SILIUS:
Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
SILIUS:
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!
VENTIDIUS:
I'll humbly signify what in his name,
VENTIDIUS:
That magical word of war, we have effected,
VENTIDIUS:
How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
VENTIDIUS:
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
VENTIDIUS:
We have jaded out o' the field.
SILIUS:
Where is he now?
VENTIDIUS:
He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
VENTIDIUS:
The weight we must convey with's will permit,
VENTIDIUS:
We shall appear before him. On there, pass along!
VENTIDIUS:
Exeunt
VENTIDIUS:
SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
VENTIDIUS:
Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another
AGRIPPA:
What, are the brothers parted?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
To part from Rome, Caesar is sad, and Lepidus,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
With the green sickness.
AGRIPPA:
'Tis a noble Lepidus.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!
AGRIPPA:
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
AGRIPPA:
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!
AGRIPPA:
O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.
AGRIPPA:
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But he loves Caesar best, yet he loves Antony
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
poets, cannot
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
AGRIPPA:
Both he loves.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
They are his shards, and he their beetle.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Trumpets within
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
So,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
AGRIPPA:
Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
AGRIPPA:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA
MARK ANTONY:
No further, sir.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You take from me a great part of myself,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The fortress of it, for better might we
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
This be not cherish'd.
MARK ANTONY:
Make me not offended
MARK ANTONY:
In your distrust.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I have said.
MARK ANTONY:
You shall not find,
MARK ANTONY:
Though you be therein curious, the least cause
MARK ANTONY:
For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
MARK ANTONY:
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
MARK ANTONY:
We will here part.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The elements be kind to thee, and make
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.
OCTAVIA:
My noble brother!
MARK ANTONY:
The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
MARK ANTONY:
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
OCTAVIA:
Sir, look well to my husband's house, and--
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
What, Octavia?
OCTAVIA:
I'll tell you in your ear.
MARK ANTONY:
Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
MARK ANTONY:
Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
MARK ANTONY:
down-feather,
MARK ANTONY:
That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
MARK ANTONY:
And neither way inclines.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside to AGRIPPA]  Will Caesar weep?
AGRIPPA:
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  He has a cloud in 's face.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside to AGRIPPA]  He were the worse for that,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
were he a horse,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
So is he, being a man.
AGRIPPA:
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  Why, Enobarbus,
AGRIPPA:
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
AGRIPPA:
He cried almost to roaring, and he wept
AGRIPPA:
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside to AGRIPPA]  That year, indeed, he was
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
troubled with a rheum,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Believe't, till I wept too.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
No, sweet Octavia,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You shall hear from me still, the time shall not
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Out-go my thinking on you.
MARK ANTONY:
Come, sir, come,
MARK ANTONY:
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love
MARK ANTONY:
Look, here I have you, thus I let you go,
MARK ANTONY:
And give you to the gods.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Adieu, be happy!
LEPIDUS:
Let all the number of the stars give light
LEPIDUS:
To thy fair way!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Farewell, fa rewell!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Kisses OCTAVIA
MARK ANTONY:
Farewell!
MARK ANTONY:
Trumpets sound. Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA:
Where is the fellow?
ALEXAS:
Half afeard to come.
CLEOPATRA:
Go to, go to.
CLEOPATRA:
Enter the Messenger as before
CLEOPATRA:
Come hither, sir.
ALEXAS:
Good majesty,
ALEXAS:
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
ALEXAS:
But when you are well pleased.
CLEOPATRA:
That Herod's head
CLEOPATRA:
I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
CLEOPATRA:
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
Messenger:
Most gracious majesty,--
CLEOPATRA:
Didst thou behold Octavia?
Messenger:
Ay, dread queen.
CLEOPATRA:
Where?
Messenger:
Madam, in Rome,
Messenger:
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Messenger:
Between her brother and Mark Antony.
CLEOPATRA:
Is she as tall as me?
Messenger:
She is not, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?
Messenger:
Madam, I heard her speak, she is low-voiced.
CLEOPATRA:
That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
CHARMIAN:
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
CLEOPATRA:
I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
CLEOPATRA:
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
CLEOPATRA:
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
Messenger:
She creeps
Messenger:
Her motion and her station are as one,
Messenger:
She shows a body rather than a life,
Messenger:
A statue than a breather.
CLEOPATRA:
Is this certain?
Messenger:
Or I have no observance.
CHARMIAN:
Three in Egypt
CHARMIAN:
Cannot make better note.
CLEOPATRA:
He's very knowing,
CLEOPATRA:
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet
CLEOPATRA:
The fellow has good judgment.
CHARMIAN:
Excellent.
CLEOPATRA:
Guess at her years, I prithee.
Messenger:
Madam,
Messenger:
She was a widow,--
CLEOPATRA:
Widow! Charmian, hark.
Messenger:
And I do think she's thirty.
CLEOPATRA:
Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
Messenger:
Round even to faultiness.
CLEOPATRA:
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
CLEOPATRA:
Her hair, what colour?
Messenger:
Brown, madam: and her forehead
Messenger:
As low as she would wish it.
CLEOPATRA:
There's gold for thee.
CLEOPATRA:
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill
CLEOPATRA:
I will employ thee back again, I find thee
CLEOPATRA:
Most fit for business: go make thee ready,
CLEOPATRA:
Our letters are prepared.
CLEOPATRA:
Exit Messenger
CHARMIAN:
A proper man.
CLEOPATRA:
Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
CLEOPATRA:
That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
CLEOPATRA:
This creature's no such thing.
CHARMIAN:
Nothing, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
CHARMIAN:
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
CHARMIAN:
And serving you so long!
CLEOPATRA:
I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian
CLEOPATRA:
But 'tis no matter, thou shalt bring him to me
CLEOPATRA:
Where I will write. All may be well enough.
CHARMIAN:
I warrant you, madam.
CHARMIAN:
Exeunt
CHARMIAN:
SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.
CHARMIAN:
Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA
MARK ANTONY:
Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
MARK ANTONY:
That were excusable, that, and thousands more
MARK ANTONY:
Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
MARK ANTONY:
New wars 'gainst Pompey, made his will, and read it
MARK ANTONY:
To public ear
MARK ANTONY:
Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
MARK ANTONY:
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
MARK ANTONY:
He vented them, most narrow measure lent me
MARK ANTONY:
When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
MARK ANTONY:
Or did it from his teeth.
OCTAVIA:
O my good lord,
OCTAVIA:
Believe not all, or, if you must believe,
OCTAVIA:
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
OCTAVIA:
If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
OCTAVIA:
Praying for both parts
OCTAVIA:
The good gods me presently,
OCTAVIA:
When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'
OCTAVIA:
Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
OCTAVIA:
'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
OCTAVIA:
Prays, and destroys the prayer, no midway
OCTAVIA:
'Twixt these extremes at all.
MARK ANTONY:
Gentle Octavia,
MARK ANTONY:
Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
MARK ANTONY:
Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,
MARK ANTONY:
I lose myself: better I were not yours
MARK ANTONY:
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
MARK ANTONY:
Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,
MARK ANTONY:
I'll raise the preparation of a war
MARK ANTONY:
Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste,
MARK ANTONY:
So your desires are yours.
OCTAVIA:
Thanks to my lord.
OCTAVIA:
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
OCTAVIA:
Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
OCTAVIA:
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
OCTAVIA:
Should solder up the rift.
MARK ANTONY:
When it appears to you where this begins,
MARK ANTONY:
Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
MARK ANTONY:
Can never be so equal, that your love
MARK ANTONY:
Can equally move with them. Provide your going,
MARK ANTONY:
Choose your own company, and command what cost
MARK ANTONY:
Your heart has mind to.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE V. The same. Another room.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
How now, friend Eros!
EROS:
There's strange news come, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What, man?
EROS:
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
This is old: what is the success?
EROS:
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
EROS:
Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let
EROS:
him partake in the glory of the action: and not
EROS:
resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
EROS:
wrote to Pompey, upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
EROS:
the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
EROS:
He's walking in the garden--thus, and spurns
EROS:
The rush that lies before him, cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
EROS:
And threats the throat of that his officer
EROS:
That murder'd Pompey.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Our great navy's rigg'd.
EROS:
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius,
EROS:
My lord desires you presently: my news
EROS:
I might have told hereafter.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
'Twill be naught
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
EROS:
Come, sir.
EROS:
Exeunt
EROS:
SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
EROS:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Since then hath made between them. Unto her
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
He gave the stablishment of Egypt, made her
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Absolute queen.
MECAENAS:
This in the public eye?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
He gave to Alexander, to Ptolemy he assign'd
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That day appear'd, and oft before gave audience,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
As 'tis reported, so.
MECAENAS:
Let Rome be thus Inform'd.
AGRIPPA:
Who, queasy with his insolence
AGRIPPA:
Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The people know it, and have now received
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
His accusations.
AGRIPPA:
Who does he accuse?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Caesar: and that, having in Sicily
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Should be deposed, and, being, that we detain
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
All his revenue.
AGRIPPA:
Sir, this should be answer'd.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That he his high authority abused,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I grant him part, but then, in his Armenia,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Demand the like.
MECAENAS:
He'll never yield to that.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter OCTAVIA with her train
OCTAVIA:
Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That ever I should call thee castaway!
OCTAVIA:
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Should have an army for an usher, and
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Long ere she did appear, the trees by the way
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Longing for what it had not, nay, the dust
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Is often left unloved, we should have met you
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
By sea and land, supplying every stage
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
With an augmented greeting.
OCTAVIA:
Good my lord,
OCTAVIA:
To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
OCTAVIA:
On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
OCTAVIA:
Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
OCTAVIA:
My grieved ear withal, whereon, I begg'd
OCTAVIA:
His pardon for return.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Which soon he granted,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
OCTAVIA:
Do not say so, my lord.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I have eyes upon him,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And his affairs come to me on the wind.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Where is he now?
OCTAVIA:
My lord, in Athens.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
No, my most wronged sister, Cleopatra
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Up to a whore, who now are levying
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The kings o' the earth for war, he hath assembled
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Bocchus, the king of Libya, Archelaus,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of Cappadocia, Philadelphos, king
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of Paphlagonia, the Thracian king, Adallas,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
King Malchus of Arabia, King of Pont,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Herod of Jewry, Mithridates, king
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of Comagene, Polemon and Amyntas,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
With a more larger list of sceptres.
OCTAVIA:
Ay me, most wretched,
OCTAVIA:
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
OCTAVIA:
That do afflict each other!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Welcome hither
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
O'er your content these strong necessities,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
But let determined things to destiny
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To do you justice, make them ministers
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And ever welcome to us.
AGRIPPA:
Welcome, lady.
MECAENAS:
Welcome, dear madam.
MECAENAS:
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you
MECAENAS:
Only the adulterous Antony, most large
MECAENAS:
In his abominations, turns you off,
MECAENAS:
And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
MECAENAS:
That noises it against us.
OCTAVIA:
Is it so, sir?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exeunt
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
CLEOPATRA:
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But why, why, why?
CLEOPATRA:
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
CLEOPATRA:
And say'st it is not fit.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Well, is it, is it?
CLEOPATRA:
If not denounced against us, why should not we
CLEOPATRA:
Be there in person?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside]  Well, I could reply
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
If we should serve with horse and mares together,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The horse were merely lost, the mares would bear
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A soldier and his horse.
CLEOPATRA:
What is't you say?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Take from his heart, take from his brain,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
from's time,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What should not then be spared. He is already
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Traduced for levity, and 'tis said in Rome
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Manage this war.
CLEOPATRA:
Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
CLEOPATRA:
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
CLEOPATRA:
And, as the president of my kingdom, will
CLEOPATRA:
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it
CLEOPATRA:
I will not stay behind.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Nay, I have done.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Here comes the emperor.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS
MARK ANTONY:
Is it not strange, Canidius,
MARK ANTONY:
That from Tarentum and Brundusium
MARK ANTONY:
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
MARK ANTONY:
And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?
CLEOPATRA:
Celerity is never more admired
CLEOPATRA:
Than by the negligent.
MARK ANTONY:
A good rebuke,
MARK ANTONY:
Which might have well becomed the best of men,
MARK ANTONY:
To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
MARK ANTONY:
Will fight with him by sea.
CLEOPATRA:
By sea! what else?
CANIDIUS:
Why will my lord do so?
MARK ANTONY:
For that he dares us to't.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
CANIDIUS:
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
CANIDIUS:
Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
CANIDIUS:
Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off,
CANIDIUS:
And so should you.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Your ships are not well mann'd,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ingross'd by swift impress, in Caesar's fleet
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Their ships are yare, yours, heavy: no disgrace
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Being prepared for land.
MARK ANTONY:
By sea, by sea.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The absolute soldiership you have by land,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Distract your army, which doth most consist
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Of war-mark'd footmen, leave unexecuted
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Your own renowned knowledge, quite forego
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The way which promises assurance, and
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
From firm security.
MARK ANTONY:
I'll fight at sea.
CLEOPATRA:
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
MARK ANTONY:
Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
MARK ANTONY:
And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
MARK ANTONY:
Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
MARK ANTONY:
We then can do't at land.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter a Messenger
MARK ANTONY:
Thy business?
Messenger:
The news is true, my lord, he is descried,
Messenger:
Caesar has taken Toryne.
MARK ANTONY:
Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible,
MARK ANTONY:
Strange that power should be. Canidius,
MARK ANTONY:
Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
MARK ANTONY:
And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship
MARK ANTONY:
Away, my Thetis!
MARK ANTONY:
Enter a Soldier
MARK ANTONY:
How now, worthy soldier?
Soldier:
O noble emperor, do not fight by sea,
Soldier:
Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
Soldier:
This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
Soldier:
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking, we
Soldier:
Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
Soldier:
And fighting foot to foot.
MARK ANTONY:
Well, well: away!
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Soldier:
By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.
CANIDIUS:
Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
CANIDIUS:
Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
CANIDIUS:
And we are women's men.
Soldier:
You keep by land
Soldier:
The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
CANIDIUS:
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
CANIDIUS:
Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea
CANIDIUS:
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
CANIDIUS:
Carries beyond belief.
Soldier:
While he was yet in Rome,
Soldier:
His power went out in such distractions as
Soldier:
Beguiled all spies.
CANIDIUS:
Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
Soldier:
They say, one Taurus.
CANIDIUS:
Well I know the man.
CANIDIUS:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
The emperor calls Canidius.
CANIDIUS:
With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,
CANIDIUS:
Each minute, some.
CANIDIUS:
Exeunt
CANIDIUS:
SCENE VIII. A plain near Actium.
CANIDIUS:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and TAURUS, with his army, marching
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Taurus!
TAURUS:
My lord?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Strike not by land, keep whole: provoke not battle,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Upon this jump.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exeunt
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
SCENE IX. Another part of the plain.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
MARK ANTONY:
Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,
MARK ANTONY:
In eye of Caesar's battle, from which place
MARK ANTONY:
We may the number of the ships behold,
MARK ANTONY:
And so proceed accordingly.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE X. Another part of the plain.
MARK ANTONY:
CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over  the stage, and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS  CAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight
MARK ANTONY:
Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
To see't mine eyes are blasted.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter SCARUS
SCARUS:
Gods and goddesses,
SCARUS:
All the whole synod of them!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What's thy passion!
SCARUS:
The greater cantle of the world is lost
SCARUS:
With very ignorance, we have kiss'd away
SCARUS:
Kingdoms and provinces.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
How appears the fight?
SCARUS:
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
SCARUS:
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
SCARUS:
Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
SCARUS:
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
SCARUS:
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
SCARUS:
The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
SCARUS:
Hoists sails and flies.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That I beheld
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Endure a further view.
SCARUS:
She once being loof'd,
SCARUS:
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
SCARUS:
Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
SCARUS:
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her
SCARUS:
I never saw an action of such shame,
SCARUS:
Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
SCARUS:
Did violate so itself.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Alack, alack!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter CANIDIUS
CANIDIUS:
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
CANIDIUS:
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
CANIDIUS:
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well
CANIDIUS:
O, he has given example for our flight,
CANIDIUS:
Most grossly, by his own!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Ay, are you thereabouts?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Why, then, good night indeed.
CANIDIUS:
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
SCARUS:
'Tis easy to't, and there I will attend
SCARUS:
What further comes.
CANIDIUS:
To Caesar will I render
CANIDIUS:
My legions and my horse: six kings already
CANIDIUS:
Show me the way of yielding.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I'll yet follow
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Sits in the wind against me.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Exeunt
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants
MARK ANTONY:
Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't,
MARK ANTONY:
It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither
MARK ANTONY:
I am so lated in the world, that I
MARK ANTONY:
Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
MARK ANTONY:
Laden with gold, take that, divide it, fly,
MARK ANTONY:
And make your peace with Caesar.
All:
Fly! not we.
MARK ANTONY:
I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
MARK ANTONY:
To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone,
MARK ANTONY:
I have myself resolved upon a course
MARK ANTONY:
Which has no need of you, be gone
MARK ANTONY:
My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
MARK ANTONY:
I follow'd that I blush to look upon
MARK ANTONY:
My very hairs do mutiny, for the white
MARK ANTONY:
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
MARK ANTONY:
For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
MARK ANTONY:
Have letters from me to some friends that will
MARK ANTONY:
Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
MARK ANTONY:
Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
MARK ANTONY:
Which my despair proclaims, let that be left
MARK ANTONY:
Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway
MARK ANTONY:
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
MARK ANTONY:
Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now
MARK ANTONY:
Nay, do so, for, indeed, I have lost command,
MARK ANTONY:
Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.
MARK ANTONY:
Sits down
MARK ANTONY:
Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS, EROS following
EROS:
Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.
IRAS:
Do, most dear queen.
CHARMIAN:
Do! why: what else?
CLEOPATRA:
Let me sit down. O Juno!
MARK ANTONY:
No, no, no, no, no.
EROS:
See you here, sir?
MARK ANTONY:
O fie, fie, fie!
CHARMIAN:
Madam!
IRAS:
Madam, O good empress!
EROS:
Sir, sir,--
MARK ANTONY:
Yes, my lord, yes, he at Philippi kept
MARK ANTONY:
His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck
MARK ANTONY:
The lean and wrinkled Cassius, and 'twas I
MARK ANTONY:
That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
MARK ANTONY:
Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had
MARK ANTONY:
In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.
CLEOPATRA:
Ah, stand by.
EROS:
The queen, my lord, the queen.
IRAS:
Go to him, madam, speak to him
IRAS:
He is unqualitied with very shame.
CLEOPATRA:
Well then, sustain him: O!
EROS:
Most noble sir, arise, the queen approaches
EROS:
Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
EROS:
Your comfort makes the rescue.
MARK ANTONY:
I have offended reputation,
MARK ANTONY:
A most unnoble swerving.
EROS:
Sir, the queen.
MARK ANTONY:
O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,
MARK ANTONY:
How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
MARK ANTONY:
By looking back what I have left behind
MARK ANTONY:
'Stroy'd in dishonour.
CLEOPATRA:
O my lord, my lord,
CLEOPATRA:
Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
CLEOPATRA:
You would have follow'd.
MARK ANTONY:
Egypt, thou knew'st too well
MARK ANTONY:
My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,
MARK ANTONY:
And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit
MARK ANTONY:
Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
MARK ANTONY:
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
MARK ANTONY:
Command me.
CLEOPATRA:
O, my pardon!
MARK ANTONY:
Now I must
MARK ANTONY:
To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
MARK ANTONY:
And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
MARK ANTONY:
With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
MARK ANTONY:
Making and marring fortunes. You did know
MARK ANTONY:
How much you were my conqueror, and that
MARK ANTONY:
My sword, made weak by my affection, would
MARK ANTONY:
Obey it on all cause.
CLEOPATRA:
Pardon, pardon!
MARK ANTONY:
Fall not a tear, I say, one of them rates
MARK ANTONY:
All that is won and lost: give me a kiss,
MARK ANTONY:
Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster,
MARK ANTONY:
Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
MARK ANTONY:
Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
MARK ANTONY:
We scorn her most when most she offers blows.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Let him appear that's come from Antony.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Know you him?
DOLABELLA:
Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster
DOLABELLA:
An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
DOLABELLA:
He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
DOLABELLA:
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
DOLABELLA:
Not many moons gone by.
DOLABELLA:
Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Approach, and speak.
EUPHRONIUS:
Such as I am, I come from Antony
EUPHRONIUS:
I was of late as petty to his ends
EUPHRONIUS:
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
EUPHRONIUS:
To his grand sea.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Be't so: declare thine office.
EUPHRONIUS:
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
EUPHRONIUS:
Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
EUPHRONIUS:
He lessens his requests, and to thee sues
EUPHRONIUS:
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
EUPHRONIUS:
A private man in Athens: this for him.
EUPHRONIUS:
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
EUPHRONIUS:
Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
EUPHRONIUS:
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
EUPHRONIUS:
Now hazarded to thy grace.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
For Antony,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I have no ears to his request. The queen
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Or take his life there: this if she perform,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
EUPHRONIUS:
Fortune pursue thee!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Bring him through the bands.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exit EUPHRONIUS
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To THYREUS
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And in our name, what she requires, add more,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
From thine invention, offers: women are not
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
In their best fortunes strong, but want will perjure
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Will answer as a law.
THYREUS:
Caesar, I go.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And what thou think'st his very action speaks
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
In every power that moves.
THYREUS:
Caesar, I shall.
THYREUS:
Exeunt
THYREUS:
SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
THYREUS:
Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
CLEOPATRA:
What shall we do, Enobarbus?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Think, and die.
CLEOPATRA:
Is Antony or we in fault for this?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Antony only, that would make his will
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
From that great face of war, whose several ranges
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Frighted each other? why should he follow?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The itch of his affection should not then
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
When half to half the world opposed, he being
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And leave his navy gazing.
CLEOPATRA:
Prithee, peace.
CLEOPATRA:
Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador
MARK ANTONY:
Is that his answer?
EUPHRONIUS:
Ay, my lord.
MARK ANTONY:
The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
MARK ANTONY:
Will yield us up.
EUPHRONIUS:
He says so.
MARK ANTONY:
Let her know't.
MARK ANTONY:
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
MARK ANTONY:
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
MARK ANTONY:
With principalities.
CLEOPATRA:
That head, my lord?
MARK ANTONY:
To him again: tell him he wears the rose
MARK ANTONY:
Of youth upon him, from which the world should note
MARK ANTONY:
Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,
MARK ANTONY:
May be a coward's, whose ministers would prevail
MARK ANTONY:
Under the service of a child as soon
MARK ANTONY:
As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
MARK ANTONY:
To lay his gay comparisons apart,
MARK ANTONY:
And answer me declined, sword against sword,
MARK ANTONY:
Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside]  Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Do draw the inward quality after them,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
His judgment too.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter an Attendant
Attendant:
A messenger from CAESAR.
CLEOPATRA:
What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
CLEOPATRA:
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
CLEOPATRA:
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.
CLEOPATRA:
Exit Attendant
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside]  Mine honesty and I begin to square.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The loyalty well held to fools does make
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Does conquer him that did his master conquer
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And earns a place i' the story.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter THYREUS
CLEOPATRA:
Caesar's will?
THYREUS:
Hear it apart.
CLEOPATRA:
None but friends: say boldly.
THYREUS:
So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.
THYREUS:
So.
THYREUS:
Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,
THYREUS:
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
THYREUS:
Further than he is Caesar.
CLEOPATRA:
Go on: right royal.
THYREUS:
He knows that you embrace not Antony
THYREUS:
As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
CLEOPATRA:
O!
THYREUS:
The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
THYREUS:
Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
THYREUS:
Not as deserved.
CLEOPATRA:
He is a god, and knows
CLEOPATRA:
What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
CLEOPATRA:
But conquer'd merely.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside]             To be sure of that,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Thy dearest quit thee.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Exit
THYREUS:
Shall I say to Caesar
THYREUS:
What you require of him? for he partly begs
THYREUS:
To be desired to give. It much would please him,
THYREUS:
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
THYREUS:
To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,
THYREUS:
To hear from me you had left Antony,
THYREUS:
And put yourself under his shrowd,
THYREUS:
The universal landlord.
CLEOPATRA:
What's your name?
THYREUS:
My name is Thyreus.
CLEOPATRA:
Most kind messenger,
CLEOPATRA:
Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
CLEOPATRA:
I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt
CLEOPATRA:
To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel
CLEOPATRA:
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
CLEOPATRA:
The doom of Egypt.
THYREUS:
'Tis your noblest course.
THYREUS:
Wisdom and fortune combating together,
THYREUS:
If that the former dare but what it can,
THYREUS:
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
THYREUS:
My duty on your hand.
CLEOPATRA:
Your Caesar's father oft,
CLEOPATRA:
When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
CLEOPATRA:
Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
CLEOPATRA:
As it rain'd kisses.
CLEOPATRA:
Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
MARK ANTONY:
Favours, by Jove that thunders!
MARK ANTONY:
What art thou, fellow?
THYREUS:
One that but performs
THYREUS:
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
THYREUS:
To have command obey'd.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside]               You will be whipp'd.
MARK ANTONY:
Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods
MARK ANTONY:
and devils!
MARK ANTONY:
Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
MARK ANTONY:
Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
MARK ANTONY:
And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
MARK ANTONY:
Antony yet.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter Attendants
MARK ANTONY:
Take hence this Jack, and whip him.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Than with an old one dying.
MARK ANTONY:
Moon and stars!
MARK ANTONY:
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
MARK ANTONY:
That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
MARK ANTONY:
So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,
MARK ANTONY:
Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
MARK ANTONY:
Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,
MARK ANTONY:
And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.
THYREUS:
Mark Antony!
MARK ANTONY:
Tug him away: being whipp'd,
MARK ANTONY:
Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall
MARK ANTONY:
Bear us an errand to him.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS
MARK ANTONY:
You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
MARK ANTONY:
Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
MARK ANTONY:
Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
MARK ANTONY:
And by a gem of women, to be abused
MARK ANTONY:
By one that looks on feeders?
CLEOPATRA:
Good my lord,--
MARK ANTONY:
You have been a boggler ever
MARK ANTONY:
But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
MARK ANTONY:
O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes,
MARK ANTONY:
In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us
MARK ANTONY:
Adore our errors, laugh at's, while we strut
MARK ANTONY:
To our confusion.
CLEOPATRA:
O, is't come to this?
MARK ANTONY:
I found you as a morsel cold upon
MARK ANTONY:
Dead Caesar's trencher, nay, you were a fragment
MARK ANTONY:
Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,
MARK ANTONY:
Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
MARK ANTONY:
Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,
MARK ANTONY:
Though you can guess what temperance should be,
MARK ANTONY:
You know not what it is.
CLEOPATRA:
Wherefore is this?
MARK ANTONY:
To let a fellow that will take rewards
MARK ANTONY:
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
MARK ANTONY:
My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
MARK ANTONY:
And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
MARK ANTONY:
Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
MARK ANTONY:
The horned herd! for I have savage cause,
MARK ANTONY:
And to proclaim it civilly, were like
MARK ANTONY:
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
MARK ANTONY:
For being yare about him.
MARK ANTONY:
Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS
MARK ANTONY:
Is he whipp'd?
First Attendant:
Soundly, my lord.
MARK ANTONY:
Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
First Attendant:
He did ask favour.
MARK ANTONY:
If that thy father live, let him repent
MARK ANTONY:
Thou wast not made his daughter, and be thou sorry
MARK ANTONY:
To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
MARK ANTONY:
Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
MARK ANTONY:
The white hand of a lady fever thee,
MARK ANTONY:
Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,
MARK ANTONY:
Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say
MARK ANTONY:
He makes me angry with him, for he seems
MARK ANTONY:
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
MARK ANTONY:
Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry,
MARK ANTONY:
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
MARK ANTONY:
When my good stars, that were my former guides,
MARK ANTONY:
Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
MARK ANTONY:
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
MARK ANTONY:
My speech and what is done, tell him he has
MARK ANTONY:
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
MARK ANTONY:
He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
MARK ANTONY:
As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou
MARK ANTONY:
Hence with thy stripes, begone!
MARK ANTONY:
Exit THYREUS
CLEOPATRA:
Have you done yet?
MARK ANTONY:
Alack, our terrene moon
MARK ANTONY:
Is now eclipsed, and it portends alone
MARK ANTONY:
The fall of Antony!
CLEOPATRA:
I must stay his time.
MARK ANTONY:
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
MARK ANTONY:
With one that ties his points?
CLEOPATRA:
Not know me yet?
MARK ANTONY:
Cold-hearted toward me?
CLEOPATRA:
Ah, dear, if I be so,
CLEOPATRA:
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
CLEOPATRA:
And poison it in the source, and the first stone
CLEOPATRA:
Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
CLEOPATRA:
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
CLEOPATRA:
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
CLEOPATRA:
Together with my brave Egyptians all,
CLEOPATRA:
By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
CLEOPATRA:
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
CLEOPATRA:
Have buried them for prey!
MARK ANTONY:
I am satisfied.
MARK ANTONY:
Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where
MARK ANTONY:
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
MARK ANTONY:
Hath nobly held, our sever'd navy too
MARK ANTONY:
Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.
MARK ANTONY:
Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
MARK ANTONY:
If from the field I shall return once more
MARK ANTONY:
To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood,
MARK ANTONY:
I and my sword will earn our chronicle
MARK ANTONY:
There's hope in't yet.
CLEOPATRA:
That's my brave lord!
MARK ANTONY:
I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,
MARK ANTONY:
And fight maliciously: for when mine hours
MARK ANTONY:
Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
MARK ANTONY:
Of me for jests, but now I'll set my teeth,
MARK ANTONY:
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
MARK ANTONY:
Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
MARK ANTONY:
All my sad captains, fill our bowls once more,
MARK ANTONY:
Let's mock the midnight bell.
CLEOPATRA:
It is my birth-day
CLEOPATRA:
I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord
CLEOPATRA:
Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
MARK ANTONY:
We will yet do well.
CLEOPATRA:
Call all his noble captains to my lord.
MARK ANTONY:
Do so, we'll speak to them, and to-night I'll force
MARK ANTONY:
The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
MARK ANTONY:
There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,
MARK ANTONY:
I'll make death love me, for I will contend
MARK ANTONY:
Even with his pestilent scythe.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The dove will peck the estridge, and I see still,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A diminution in our captain's brain
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Some way to leave him.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Exit
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
ACT IV
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army, OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
He calls me boy, and chides, as he had power
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To beat me out of Egypt, my messenger
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
He hath whipp'd with rods, dares me to personal combat,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I have many other ways to die, meantime
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Laugh at his challenge.
MECAENAS:
Caesar must think,
MECAENAS:
When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
MECAENAS:
Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
MECAENAS:
Make boot of his distraction: never anger
MECAENAS:
Made good guard for itself.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Let our best heads
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
We mean to fight: within our files there are,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enough to fetch him in. See it done
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And feast the army, we have store to do't,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exeunt
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
SCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter MARK ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, with others
MARK ANTONY:
He will not fight with me, Domitius.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
No.
MARK ANTONY:
Why should he not?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
He is twenty men to one.
MARK ANTONY:
To-morrow, soldier,
MARK ANTONY:
By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
MARK ANTONY:
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
MARK ANTONY:
Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
MARK ANTONY:
Well said, come on.
MARK ANTONY:
Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
MARK ANTONY:
Be bounteous at our meal.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter three or four Servitors
MARK ANTONY:
Give me thy hand,
MARK ANTONY:
Thou hast been rightly honest,--so hast thou,--
MARK ANTONY:
Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,
MARK ANTONY:
And kings have been your fellows.
CLEOPATRA:
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What means this?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  'Tis one of those odd
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
tricks which sorrow shoots
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Out of the mind.
MARK ANTONY:
And thou art honest too.
MARK ANTONY:
I wish I could be made so many men,
MARK ANTONY:
And all of you clapp'd up together in
MARK ANTONY:
An Antony, that I might do you service
MARK ANTONY:
So good as you have done.
All:
The gods forbid!
MARK ANTONY:
Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night
MARK ANTONY:
Scant not my cups, and make as much of me
MARK ANTONY:
As when mine empire was your fellow too,
MARK ANTONY:
And suffer'd my command.
CLEOPATRA:
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What does he mean?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  To make his followers weep.
MARK ANTONY:
Tend me to-night,
MARK ANTONY:
May be it is the period of your duty
MARK ANTONY:
Haply you shall not see me more, or if,
MARK ANTONY:
A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
MARK ANTONY:
You'll serve another master. I look on you
MARK ANTONY:
As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
MARK ANTONY:
I turn you not away, but, like a master
MARK ANTONY:
Married to your good service, stay till death
MARK ANTONY:
Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
MARK ANTONY:
And the gods yield you for't!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
What mean you, sir,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Transform us not to women.
MARK ANTONY:
Ho, ho, ho!
MARK ANTONY:
Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
MARK ANTONY:
Grace grow where those drops fall!
MARK ANTONY:
My hearty friends,
MARK ANTONY:
You take me in too dolorous a sense,
MARK ANTONY:
For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
MARK ANTONY:
To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
MARK ANTONY:
I hope well of to-morrow, and will lead you
MARK ANTONY:
Where rather I'll expect victorious life
MARK ANTONY:
Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
MARK ANTONY:
And drown consideration.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE III. The same. Before the palace.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter two Soldiers to their guard
First Soldier:
Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.
Second Soldier:
It will determine one way: fare you well.
Second Soldier:
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
First Soldier:
Nothing. What news?
Second Soldier:
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
First Soldier:
Well, sir, good night.
First Soldier:
Enter two other Soldiers
Second Soldier:
Soldiers, have careful watch.
Third Soldier:
And you. Good night, good night.
Third Soldier:
They place themselves in every corner of the stage
Fourth Soldier:
Here we: and if to-morrow
Fourth Soldier:
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Fourth Soldier:
Our landmen will stand up.
Third Soldier:
'Tis a brave army,
Third Soldier:
And full of purpose.
Third Soldier:
Music of the hautboys as under the stage
Fourth Soldier:
Peace! what noise?
First Soldier:
List, list!
Second Soldier:
Hark!
First Soldier:
Music i' the air.
Third Soldier:
Under the earth.
Fourth Soldier:
It signs well, does it not?
Third Soldier:
No.
First Soldier:
Peace, I say!
First Soldier:
What should this mean?
Second Soldier:
'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
Second Soldier:
Now leaves him.
First Soldier:
Walk, let's see if other watchmen
First Soldier:
Do hear what we do?
First Soldier:
They advance to another post
Second Soldier:
How now, masters!
All:
[Speaking together]  How now!
All:
How now! do you hear this?
First Soldier:
Ay, is't not strange?
Third Soldier:
Do you hear, masters? do you hear?
First Soldier:
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter,
First Soldier:
Let's see how it will give off.
All:
Content. 'Tis strange.
All:
Exeunt
All:
SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace.
All:
Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and others attending
MARK ANTONY:
Eros! mine armour, Eros!
CLEOPATRA:
Sleep a little.
MARK ANTONY:
No, my chuck. Eros, come, mine armour, Eros!
MARK ANTONY:
Enter EROS with armour
MARK ANTONY:
Come good fellow, put mine iron on
MARK ANTONY:
If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
MARK ANTONY:
Because we brave her: come.
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, I'll help too.
CLEOPATRA:
What's this for?
MARK ANTONY:
Ah, let be, let be! thou art
MARK ANTONY:
The armourer of my heart: false, false, this, this.
CLEOPATRA:
Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.
MARK ANTONY:
Well, well,
MARK ANTONY:
We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
MARK ANTONY:
Go put on thy defences.
EROS:
Briefly, sir.
CLEOPATRA:
Is not this buckled well?
MARK ANTONY:
Rarely, rarely
MARK ANTONY:
He that unbuckles this, till we do please
MARK ANTONY:
To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
MARK ANTONY:
Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen's a squire
MARK ANTONY:
More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,
MARK ANTONY:
That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
MARK ANTONY:
The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
MARK ANTONY:
A workman in't.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter an armed Soldier
MARK ANTONY:
Good morrow to thee, welcome
MARK ANTONY:
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge
MARK ANTONY:
To business that we love we rise betime,
MARK ANTONY:
And go to't with delight.
Soldier:
A thousand, sir,
Soldier:
Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
Soldier:
And at the port expect you.
Soldier:
Shout. Trumpets flourish
Soldier:
Enter Captains and Soldiers
Captain:
The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.
All:
Good morrow, general.
MARK ANTONY:
'Tis well blown, lads
MARK ANTONY:
This morning, like the spirit of a youth
MARK ANTONY:
That means to be of note, begins betimes.
MARK ANTONY:
So, so, come, give me that: this way, well said.
MARK ANTONY:
Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me
MARK ANTONY:
This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable
MARK ANTONY:
Kisses her
MARK ANTONY:
And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
MARK ANTONY:
On more mechanic compliment, I'll leave thee
MARK ANTONY:
Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
MARK ANTONY:
Follow me close, I'll bring you to't. Adieu.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt MARK ANTONY, EROS, Captains, and Soldiers
CHARMIAN:
Please you, retire to your chamber.
CLEOPATRA:
Lead me.
CLEOPATRA:
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
CLEOPATRA:
Determine this great war in single fight!
CLEOPATRA:
Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.
CLEOPATRA:
Exeunt
CLEOPATRA:
SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp.
CLEOPATRA:
Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS, a Soldier meeting them
Soldier:
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
MARK ANTONY:
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
MARK ANTONY:
To make me fight at land!
Soldier:
Hadst thou done so,
Soldier:
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
Soldier:
That has this morning left thee, would have still
Soldier:
Follow'd thy heels.
MARK ANTONY:
Who's gone this morning?
Soldier:
Who!
Soldier:
One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
Soldier:
He shall not hear thee, or from Caesar's camp
Soldier:
Say 'I am none of thine.'
MARK ANTONY:
What say'st thou?
Soldier:
Sir,
Soldier:
He is with Caesar.
EROS:
Sir, his chests and treasure
EROS:
He has not with him.
MARK ANTONY:
Is he gone?
Soldier:
Most certain.
MARK ANTONY:
Go, Eros, send his treasure after, do it,
MARK ANTONY:
Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
MARK ANTONY:
I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings,
MARK ANTONY:
Say that I wish he never find more cause
MARK ANTONY:
To change a master. O, my fortunes have
MARK ANTONY:
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE VI. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
MARK ANTONY:
Flourish. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, with DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, and others
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Our will is Antony be took alive,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Make it so known.
AGRIPPA:
Caesar, I shall.
AGRIPPA:
Exit
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The time of universal peace is near
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Shall bear the olive freely.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Antony
Messenger:
Is come into the field.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Go charge Agrippa
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Plant those that have revolted in the van,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That Antony may seem to spend his fury
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Upon himself.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Alexas did revolt, and went to Jewry on
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Affairs of Antony, there did persuade
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And leave his master Antony: for this pains
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That fell away have entertainment, but
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
No honourable trust. I have done ill,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That I will joy no more.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's
Soldier:
Enobarbus, Antony
Soldier:
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
Soldier:
His bounty overplus: the messenger
Soldier:
Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now
Soldier:
Unloading of his mules.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I give it you.
Soldier:
Mock not, Enobarbus.
Soldier:
I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
Soldier:
Out of the host, I must attend mine office,
Soldier:
Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
Soldier:
Continues still a Jove.
Soldier:
Exit
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I am alone the villain of the earth,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
My better service, when my turpitude
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Some ditch wherein to die, the foul'st best fits
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
My latter part of life.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Exit
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others
AGRIPPA:
Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far
AGRIPPA:
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
AGRIPPA:
Exceeds what we expected.
AGRIPPA:
Exeunt
AGRIPPA:
Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded
SCARUS:
O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
SCARUS:
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
SCARUS:
With clouts about their heads.
MARK ANTONY:
Thou bleed'st apace.
SCARUS:
I had a wound here that was like a T,
SCARUS:
But now 'tis made an H.
MARK ANTONY:
They do retire.
SCARUS:
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
SCARUS:
Room for six scotches more.
SCARUS:
Enter EROS
EROS:
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
EROS:
For a fair victory.
SCARUS:
Let us score their backs,
SCARUS:
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind
SCARUS:
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
MARK ANTONY:
I will reward thee
MARK ANTONY:
Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold
MARK ANTONY:
For thy good valour. Come thee on.
SCARUS:
I'll halt after.
SCARUS:
Exeunt
SCARUS:
SCENE VIII. Under the walls of Alexandria.
SCARUS:
Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY, in a march, SCARUS, with others
MARK ANTONY:
We have beat him to his camp: run one before,
MARK ANTONY:
And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
MARK ANTONY:
Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
MARK ANTONY:
That has to-day escaped. I thank you all,
MARK ANTONY:
For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
MARK ANTONY:
Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been
MARK ANTONY:
Each man's like mine, you have shown all Hectors.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
MARK ANTONY:
Tell them your feats, whilst they with joyful tears
MARK ANTONY:
Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
MARK ANTONY:
The honour'd gashes whole.
MARK ANTONY:
To SCARUS
MARK ANTONY:
Give me thy hand
MARK ANTONY:
Enter CLEOPATRA, attended
MARK ANTONY:
To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
MARK ANTONY:
Make her thanks bless thee.
MARK ANTONY:
To CLEOPATRA
MARK ANTONY:
O thou day o' the world,
MARK ANTONY:
Chain mine arm'd neck, leap thou, attire and all,
MARK ANTONY:
Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
MARK ANTONY:
Ride on the pants triumphing!
CLEOPATRA:
Lord of lords!
CLEOPATRA:
O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
CLEOPATRA:
The world's great snare uncaught?
MARK ANTONY:
My nightingale,
MARK ANTONY:
We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!
MARK ANTONY:
though grey
MARK ANTONY:
Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
MARK ANTONY:
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
MARK ANTONY:
Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man,
MARK ANTONY:
Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand
MARK ANTONY:
Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
MARK ANTONY:
As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
MARK ANTONY:
Destroy'd in such a shape.
CLEOPATRA:
I'll give thee, friend,
CLEOPATRA:
An armour all of gold, it was a king's.
MARK ANTONY:
He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
MARK ANTONY:
Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand
MARK ANTONY:
Through Alexandria make a jolly march,
MARK ANTONY:
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them
MARK ANTONY:
Had our great palace the capacity
MARK ANTONY:
To camp this host, we all would sup together,
MARK ANTONY:
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
MARK ANTONY:
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
MARK ANTONY:
With brazen din blast you the city's ear,
MARK ANTONY:
Make mingle with rattling tabourines,
MARK ANTONY:
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
MARK ANTONY:
Applauding our approach.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
MARK ANTONY:
Sentinels at their post
First Soldier:
If we be not relieved within this hour,
First Soldier:
We must return to the court of guard: the night
First Soldier:
Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
First Soldier:
By the second hour i' the morn.
Second Soldier:
This last day was
Second Soldier:
A shrewd one to's.
Second Soldier:
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
O, bear me witness, night,--
Third Soldier:
What man is this?
Second Soldier:
Stand close, and list him.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
When men revolted shall upon record
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Before thy face repent!
First Soldier:
Enobarbus!
Third Soldier:
Peace!
Third Soldier:
Hark further.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
That life, a very rebel to my will,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Against the flint and hardness of my fault
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Forgive me in thine own particular,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
But let the world rank me in register
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
A master-leaver and a fugitive
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
O Antony! O Antony!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS:
Dies
Second Soldier:
Let's speak To him.
First Soldier:
Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
First Soldier:
May concern Caesar.
Third Soldier:
Let's do so. But he sleeps.
First Soldier:
Swoons rather, for so bad a prayer as his
First Soldier:
Was never yet for sleep.
Second Soldier:
Go we to him.
Third Soldier:
Awake, sir, awake, speak to us.
Second Soldier:
Hear you, sir?
First Soldier:
The hand of death hath raught him.
First Soldier:
Drums afar off
First Soldier:
Hark! the drums
First Soldier:
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
First Soldier:
To the court of guard, he is of note: our hour
First Soldier:
Is fully out.
Third Soldier:
Come on, then,
Third Soldier:
He may recover yet.
Third Soldier:
Exeunt with the body
Third Soldier:
SCENE X. Between the two camps.
Third Soldier:
Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS, with their Army
MARK ANTONY:
Their preparation is to-day by sea,
MARK ANTONY:
We please them not by land.
SCARUS:
For both, my lord.
MARK ANTONY:
I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air,
MARK ANTONY:
We'ld fight there too. But this it is, our foot
MARK ANTONY:
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
MARK ANTONY:
Shall stay with us: order for sea is given,
MARK ANTONY:
They have put forth the haven
MARK ANTONY:
Where their appointment we may best discover,
MARK ANTONY:
And look on their endeavour.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE XI. Another part of the same.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and his Army
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
But being charged, we will be still by land,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Which, as I take't, we shall, for his best force
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And hold our best advantage.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exeunt
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
SCENE XII. Another part of the same.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS
MARK ANTONY:
Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine
MARK ANTONY:
does stand,
MARK ANTONY:
I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word
MARK ANTONY:
Straight, how 'tis like to go.
MARK ANTONY:
Exit
SCARUS:
Swallows have built
SCARUS:
In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
SCARUS:
Say they know not, they cannot tell, look grimly,
SCARUS:
And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
SCARUS:
Is valiant, and dejected, and, by starts,
SCARUS:
His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,
SCARUS:
Of what he has, and has not.
SCARUS:
Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight
SCARUS:
Re-enter MARK ANTONY
MARK ANTONY:
All is lost,
MARK ANTONY:
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me
MARK ANTONY:
My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
MARK ANTONY:
They cast their caps up and carouse together
MARK ANTONY:
Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
MARK ANTONY:
'tis thou
MARK ANTONY:
Hast sold me to this novice, and my heart
MARK ANTONY:
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly,
MARK ANTONY:
For when I am revenged upon my charm,
MARK ANTONY:
I have done all. Bid them all fly, begone.
MARK ANTONY:
Exit SCARUS
MARK ANTONY:
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more
MARK ANTONY:
Fortune and Antony part here, even here
MARK ANTONY:
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
MARK ANTONY:
That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
MARK ANTONY:
Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
MARK ANTONY:
On blossoming Caesar, and this pine is bark'd,
MARK ANTONY:
That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am
MARK ANTONY:
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--
MARK ANTONY:
Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home,
MARK ANTONY:
Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
MARK ANTONY:
Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
MARK ANTONY:
Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
MARK ANTONY:
What, Eros, Eros!
MARK ANTONY:
Enter CLEOPATRA
MARK ANTONY:
Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!
CLEOPATRA:
Why is my lord enraged against his love?
MARK ANTONY:
Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,
MARK ANTONY:
And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,
MARK ANTONY:
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians
MARK ANTONY:
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
MARK ANTONY:
Of all thy sex, most monster-like, be shown
MARK ANTONY:
For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
MARK ANTONY:
Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
MARK ANTONY:
With her prepared nails.
MARK ANTONY:
Exit CLEOPATRA
MARK ANTONY:
'Tis well thou'rt gone,
MARK ANTONY:
If it be well to live, but better 'twere
MARK ANTONY:
Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
MARK ANTONY:
Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
MARK ANTONY:
The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,
MARK ANTONY:
Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage
MARK ANTONY:
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon,
MARK ANTONY:
And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
MARK ANTONY:
Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die
MARK ANTONY:
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
MARK ANTONY:
Under this plot, she dies for't. Eros, ho!
MARK ANTONY:
Exit
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA:
Help me, my women! O, he is more mad
CLEOPATRA:
Than Telamon for his shield, the boar of Thessaly
CLEOPATRA:
Was never so emboss'd.
CHARMIAN:
To the monument!
CHARMIAN:
There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
CHARMIAN:
The soul and body rive not more in parting
CHARMIAN:
Than greatness going off.
CLEOPATRA:
To the monument!
CLEOPATRA:
Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself,
CLEOPATRA:
Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
CLEOPATRA:
And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,
CLEOPATRA:
And bring me how he takes my death.
CLEOPATRA:
To the monument!
CLEOPATRA:
Exeunt
CLEOPATRA:
SCENE XIV. The same. Another room.
CLEOPATRA:
Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS
MARK ANTONY:
Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
EROS:
Ay, noble lord.
MARK ANTONY:
Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish,
MARK ANTONY:
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
MARK ANTONY:
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
MARK ANTONY:
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
MARK ANTONY:
With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,
MARK ANTONY:
And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen
MARK ANTONY:
these signs,
MARK ANTONY:
They are black vesper's pageants.
EROS:
Ay, my lord,
MARK ANTONY:
That which is now a horse, even with a thought
MARK ANTONY:
The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
MARK ANTONY:
As water is in water.
EROS:
It does, my lord.
MARK ANTONY:
My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
MARK ANTONY:
Even such a body: here I am Antony
MARK ANTONY:
Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
MARK ANTONY:
I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--
MARK ANTONY:
Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
MARK ANTONY:
Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
MARK ANTONY:
A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
MARK ANTONY:
Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
MARK ANTONY:
Unto an enemy's triumph.
MARK ANTONY:
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros, there is left us
MARK ANTONY:
Ourselves to end ourselves.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter MARDIAN
MARK ANTONY:
O! thy vile lady!
MARK ANTONY:
She has robb'd me of my sword.
MARDIAN:
No, Antony,
MARDIAN:
My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
MARDIAN:
With thine entirely.
MARK ANTONY:
Hence, saucy eunuch, peace!
MARK ANTONY:
She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
MARDIAN:
Death of one person can be paid but once,
MARDIAN:
And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
MARDIAN:
Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
MARDIAN:
Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
MARDIAN:
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
MARDIAN:
The name of Antony, it was divided
MARDIAN:
Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
MARDIAN:
Thy name so buried in her.
MARK ANTONY:
Dead, then?
MARDIAN:
Dead.
MARK ANTONY:
Unarm, Eros, the long day's task is done,
MARK ANTONY:
And we must sleep.
MARK ANTONY:
To MARDIAN
MARK ANTONY:
That thou depart'st hence safe,
MARK ANTONY:
Does pay thy labour richly, go.
MARK ANTONY:
Exit MARDIAN
MARK ANTONY:
Off, pluck off
MARK ANTONY:
The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
MARK ANTONY:
The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
MARK ANTONY:
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
MARK ANTONY:
Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
MARK ANTONY:
No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go,
MARK ANTONY:
You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
MARK ANTONY:
Exit EROS
MARK ANTONY:
I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
MARK ANTONY:
Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
MARK ANTONY:
All length is torture: since the torch is out,
MARK ANTONY:
Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour
MARK ANTONY:
Mars what it does, yea, very force entangles
MARK ANTONY:
Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.
MARK ANTONY:
Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me
MARK ANTONY:
Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
MARK ANTONY:
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze
MARK ANTONY:
Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,
MARK ANTONY:
And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!
MARK ANTONY:
Re-enter EROS
EROS:
What would my lord?
MARK ANTONY:
Since Cleopatra died,
MARK ANTONY:
I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods
MARK ANTONY:
Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
MARK ANTONY:
Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
MARK ANTONY:
With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
MARK ANTONY:
The courage of a woman, less noble mind
MARK ANTONY:
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
MARK ANTONY:
'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
MARK ANTONY:
That, when the exigent should come, which now
MARK ANTONY:
Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
MARK ANTONY:
The inevitable prosecution of
MARK ANTONY:
Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
MARK ANTONY:
Thou then wouldst kill me: do't, the time is come
MARK ANTONY:
Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
MARK ANTONY:
Put colour in thy cheek.
EROS:
The gods withhold me!
EROS:
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
EROS:
Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?
MARK ANTONY:
Eros,
MARK ANTONY:
Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
MARK ANTONY:
Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
MARK ANTONY:
His corrigible neck, his face subdued
MARK ANTONY:
To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
MARK ANTONY:
Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
MARK ANTONY:
His baseness that ensued?
EROS:
I would not see't.
MARK ANTONY:
Come, then, for with a wound I must be cured.
MARK ANTONY:
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
MARK ANTONY:
Most useful for thy country.
EROS:
O, sir, pardon me!
MARK ANTONY:
When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
MARK ANTONY:
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
MARK ANTONY:
Or thy precedent services are all
MARK ANTONY:
But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.
EROS:
Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
EROS:
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
MARK ANTONY:
Lo thee!
MARK ANTONY:
Turning from him
EROS:
My sword is drawn.
MARK ANTONY:
Then let it do at once
MARK ANTONY:
The thing why thou hast drawn it.
EROS:
My dear master,
EROS:
My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
EROS:
Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
MARK ANTONY:
'Tis said, man, and farewell.
EROS:
Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
MARK ANTONY:
Now, Eros.
EROS:
Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow
EROS:
Of Antony's death.
EROS:
Kills himself
MARK ANTONY:
Thrice-nobler than myself!
MARK ANTONY:
Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
MARK ANTONY:
I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
MARK ANTONY:
Have by their brave instruction got upon me
MARK ANTONY:
A nobleness in record: but I will be
MARK ANTONY:
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
MARK ANTONY:
As to a lover's bed. Come, then, and, Eros,
MARK ANTONY:
Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus
MARK ANTONY:
Falling on his sword
MARK ANTONY:
I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
MARK ANTONY:
The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
MARK ANTONY:
Enter DERCETAS and Guard
First Guard:
What's the noise?
MARK ANTONY:
I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end
MARK ANTONY:
Of what I have begun.
Second Guard:
The star is fall'n.
First Guard:
And time is at his period.
All:
Alas, and woe!
MARK ANTONY:
Let him that loves me strike me dead.
First Guard:
Not I.
Second Guard:
Nor I.
Third Guard:
Nor any one.
Third Guard:
Exeunt Guard
DERCETAS:
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
DERCETAS:
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
DERCETAS:
Shall enter me with him.
DERCETAS:
Enter DIOMEDES
DIOMEDES:
Where's Antony?
DERCETAS:
There, Diomed there.
DIOMEDES:
Lives he?
DIOMEDES:
Wilt thou not answer, man?
DIOMEDES:
Exit DERCETAS
MARK ANTONY:
Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
MARK ANTONY:
Sufficing strokes for death.
DIOMEDES:
Most absolute lord,
DIOMEDES:
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
MARK ANTONY:
When did she send thee?
DIOMEDES:
Now, my lord.
MARK ANTONY:
Where is she?
DIOMEDES:
Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
DIOMEDES:
Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
DIOMEDES:
Which never shall be found--you did suspect
DIOMEDES:
She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
DIOMEDES:
Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead,
DIOMEDES:
But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
DIOMEDES:
Me to proclaim the truth, and I am come,
DIOMEDES:
I dread, too late.
MARK ANTONY:
Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.
DIOMEDES:
What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!
DIOMEDES:
Come, your lord calls!
DIOMEDES:
Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY
MARK ANTONY:
Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides,
MARK ANTONY:
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
First Guard:
Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
First Guard:
All your true followers out.
All:
Most heavy day!
MARK ANTONY:
Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
MARK ANTONY:
To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome
MARK ANTONY:
Which comes to punish us, and we punish it
MARK ANTONY:
Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up
MARK ANTONY:
I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,
MARK ANTONY:
And have my thanks for all.
MARK ANTONY:
Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY
MARK ANTONY:
SCENE XV. The same. A monument.
MARK ANTONY:
Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN and IRAS
CLEOPATRA:
O Charmian, I will never go from hence.
CHARMIAN:
Be comforted, dear madam.
CLEOPATRA:
No, I will not
CLEOPATRA:
All strange and terrible events are welcome,
CLEOPATRA:
But comforts we despise, our size of sorrow,
CLEOPATRA:
Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
CLEOPATRA:
As that which makes it.
CLEOPATRA:
Enter, below, DIOMEDES
CLEOPATRA:
How now! is he dead?
DIOMEDES:
His death's upon him, but not dead.
DIOMEDES:
Look out o' the other side your monument,
DIOMEDES:
His guard have brought him thither.
DIOMEDES:
Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard
CLEOPATRA:
O sun,
CLEOPATRA:
Burn the great sphere thou movest in!
CLEOPATRA:
darkling stand
CLEOPATRA:
The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,
CLEOPATRA:
Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help,
CLEOPATRA:
Help, friends below, let's draw him hither.
MARK ANTONY:
Peace!
MARK ANTONY:
Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
MARK ANTONY:
But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.
CLEOPATRA:
So it should be, that none but Antony
CLEOPATRA:
Should conquer Antony, but woe 'tis so!
MARK ANTONY:
I am dying, Egypt, dying, only
MARK ANTONY:
I here importune death awhile, until
MARK ANTONY:
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
MARK ANTONY:
I lay up thy lips.
CLEOPATRA:
I dare not, dear,--
CLEOPATRA:
Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,
CLEOPATRA:
Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
CLEOPATRA:
Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
CLEOPATRA:
Be brooch'd with me, if knife, drugs,
CLEOPATRA:
serpents, have
CLEOPATRA:
Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe
CLEOPATRA:
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
CLEOPATRA:
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
CLEOPATRA:
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--
CLEOPATRA:
Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up
CLEOPATRA:
Assist, good friends.
MARK ANTONY:
O, quick, or I am gone.
CLEOPATRA:
Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
CLEOPATRA:
Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
CLEOPATRA:
That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,
CLEOPATRA:
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
CLEOPATRA:
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--
CLEOPATRA:
Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come,
CLEOPATRA:
They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA
CLEOPATRA:
And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived
CLEOPATRA:
Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,
CLEOPATRA:
Thus would I wear them out.
All:
A heavy sight!
MARK ANTONY:
I am dying, Egypt, dying
MARK ANTONY:
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.
CLEOPATRA:
No, let me speak, and let me rail so high,
CLEOPATRA:
That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
CLEOPATRA:
Provoked by my offence.
MARK ANTONY:
One word, sweet queen
MARK ANTONY:
Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!
CLEOPATRA:
They do not go together.
MARK ANTONY:
Gentle, hear me
MARK ANTONY:
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
CLEOPATRA:
My resolution and my hands I'll trust,
CLEOPATRA:
None about Caesar.
MARK ANTONY:
The miserable change now at my end
MARK ANTONY:
Lament nor sorrow at, but please your thoughts
MARK ANTONY:
In feeding them with those my former fortunes
MARK ANTONY:
Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,
MARK ANTONY:
The noblest, and do now not basely die,
MARK ANTONY:
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
MARK ANTONY:
My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman
MARK ANTONY:
Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going,
MARK ANTONY:
I can no more.
CLEOPATRA:
Noblest of men, woo't die?
CLEOPATRA:
Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
CLEOPATRA:
In this dull world, which in thy absence is
CLEOPATRA:
No better than a sty? O, see, my women,
CLEOPATRA:
MARK ANTONY dies
CLEOPATRA:
The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
CLEOPATRA:
O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
CLEOPATRA:
The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
CLEOPATRA:
Are level now with men, the odds is gone,
CLEOPATRA:
And there is nothing left remarkable
CLEOPATRA:
Beneath the visiting moon.
CLEOPATRA:
Faints
CHARMIAN:
O, quietness, lady!
IRAS:
She is dead too, our sovereign.
CHARMIAN:
Lady!
IRAS:
Madam!
CHARMIAN:
O madam, madam, madam!
IRAS:
Royal Egypt, Empress!
CHARMIAN:
Peace, peace, Iras!
CLEOPATRA:
No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
CLEOPATRA:
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
CLEOPATRA:
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
CLEOPATRA:
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods,
CLEOPATRA:
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
CLEOPATRA:
Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught,
CLEOPATRA:
Patience is scottish, and impatience does
CLEOPATRA:
Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
CLEOPATRA:
To rush into the secret house of death,
CLEOPATRA:
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
CLEOPATRA:
What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
CLEOPATRA:
My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
CLEOPATRA:
Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart
CLEOPATRA:
We'll bury him, and then, what's brave,
CLEOPATRA:
what's noble,
CLEOPATRA:
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
CLEOPATRA:
And make death proud to take us. Come, away
CLEOPATRA:
This case of that huge spirit now is cold
CLEOPATRA:
Ah, women, women! come, we have no friend
CLEOPATRA:
But resolution, and the briefest end.
CLEOPATRA:
Exeunt, those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body
CLEOPATRA:
ACT V
CLEOPATRA:
SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
CLEOPATRA:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The pauses that he makes.
DOLABELLA:
Caesar, I shall.
DOLABELLA:
Exit
DOLABELLA:
Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Appear thus to us?
DERCETAS:
I am call'd Dercetas,
DERCETAS:
Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
DERCETAS:
Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,
DERCETAS:
He was my master, and I wore my life
DERCETAS:
To spend upon his haters. If thou please
DERCETAS:
To take me to thee, as I was to him
DERCETAS:
I'll be to Caesar, if thou pleasest not,
DERCETAS:
I yield thee up my life.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
What is't thou say'st?
DERCETAS:
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The breaking of so great a thing should make
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
A greater crack: the round world
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Should have shook lions into civil streets,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Is not a single doom, in the name lay
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
A moiety of the world.
DERCETAS:
He is dead, Caesar
DERCETAS:
Not by a public minister of justice,
DERCETAS:
Nor by a hired knife, but that self hand,
DERCETAS:
Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
DERCETAS:
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
DERCETAS:
Splitted the heart. This is his sword,
DERCETAS:
I robb'd his wound of it, behold it stain'd
DERCETAS:
With his most noble blood.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Look you sad, friends?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To wash the eyes of kings.
AGRIPPA:
And strange it is,
AGRIPPA:
That nature must compel us to lament
AGRIPPA:
Our most persisted deeds.
MECAENAS:
His taints and honours
MECAENAS:
Waged equal with him.
AGRIPPA:
A rarer spirit never
AGRIPPA:
Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us
AGRIPPA:
Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
MECAENAS:
When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
MECAENAS:
He needs must see himself.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
O Antony!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I have follow'd thee to this, but we do lance
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Have shown to thee such a declining day,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Or look on thine, we could not stall together
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
In the whole world: but yet let me lament,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That thou, my brother, my competitor
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
In top of all design, my mate in empire,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Friend and companion in the front of war,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The arm of mine own body, and the heart
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Unreconciliable, should divide
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
But I will tell you at some meeter season
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter an Egyptian
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The business of this man looks out of him,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
Egyptian:
A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
Egyptian:
Confined in all she has, her monument,
Egyptian:
Of thy intents desires instruction,
Egyptian:
That she preparedly may frame herself
Egyptian:
To the way she's forced to.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Bid her have good heart
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
How honourable and how kindly we
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Determine for her, for Caesar cannot live
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To be ungentle.
Egyptian:
So the gods preserve thee!
Egyptian:
Exit
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The quality of her passion shall require,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
She do defeat us, for her life in Rome
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Would be eternal in our triumph: go,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And with your speediest bring us what she says,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And how you find of her.
PROCULEIUS:
Caesar, I shall.
PROCULEIUS:
Exit
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Gallus, go you along.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exit GALLUS
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Where's Dolabella,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To second Proculeius?
All:
Dolabella!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Let him alone, for I remember now
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
How hardly I was drawn into this war,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
How calm and gentle I proceeded still
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
In all my writings: go with me, and see
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
What I can show in this.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exeunt
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
CLEOPATRA:
My desolation does begin to make
CLEOPATRA:
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar,
CLEOPATRA:
Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
CLEOPATRA:
A minister of her will: and it is great
CLEOPATRA:
To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
CLEOPATRA:
Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
CLEOPATRA:
Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
CLEOPATRA:
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
CLEOPATRA:
Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and Soldiers
PROCULEIUS:
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt,
PROCULEIUS:
And bids thee study on what fair demands
PROCULEIUS:
Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
CLEOPATRA:
What's thy name?
PROCULEIUS:
My name is Proculeius.
CLEOPATRA:
Antony
CLEOPATRA:
Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but
CLEOPATRA:
I do not greatly care to be deceived,
CLEOPATRA:
That have no use for trusting. If your master
CLEOPATRA:
Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
CLEOPATRA:
That majesty, to keep decorum, must
CLEOPATRA:
No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
CLEOPATRA:
To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
CLEOPATRA:
He gives me so much of mine own, as I
CLEOPATRA:
Will kneel to him with thanks.
PROCULEIUS:
Be of good cheer,
PROCULEIUS:
You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing
PROCULEIUS:
Make your full reference freely to my lord,
PROCULEIUS:
Who is so full of grace, that it flows over
PROCULEIUS:
On all that need: let me report to him
PROCULEIUS:
Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
PROCULEIUS:
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,
PROCULEIUS:
Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
CLEOPATRA:
Pray you, tell him
CLEOPATRA:
I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
CLEOPATRA:
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
CLEOPATRA:
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
CLEOPATRA:
Look him i' the face.
PROCULEIUS:
This I'll report, dear lady.
PROCULEIUS:
Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
PROCULEIUS:
Of him that caused it.
GALLUS:
You see how easily she may be surprised
GALLUS:
Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,  having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates
GALLUS:
To PROCULEIUS and the Guard
GALLUS:
Guard her till Caesar come.
GALLUS:
Exit
IRAS:
Royal queen!
CHARMIAN:
O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen
CLEOPATRA:
Quick, quick, good hands.
CLEOPATRA:
Drawing a dagger
PROCULEIUS:
Hold, worthy lady, hold
PROCULEIUS:
Seizes and disarms her
PROCULEIUS:
Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
PROCULEIUS:
Relieved, but not betray'd.
CLEOPATRA:
What, of death too,
CLEOPATRA:
That rids our dogs of languish?
PROCULEIUS:
Cleopatra,
PROCULEIUS:
Do not abuse my master's bounty by
PROCULEIUS:
The undoing of yourself: let the world see
PROCULEIUS:
His nobleness well acted, which your death
PROCULEIUS:
Will never let come forth.
CLEOPATRA:
Where art thou, death?
CLEOPATRA:
Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
CLEOPATRA:
Worthy many babes and beggars!
PROCULEIUS:
O, temperance, lady!
CLEOPATRA:
Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir,
CLEOPATRA:
If idle talk will once be necessary,
CLEOPATRA:
I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,
CLEOPATRA:
Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
CLEOPATRA:
Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
CLEOPATRA:
Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
CLEOPATRA:
Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
CLEOPATRA:
And show me to the shouting varletry
CLEOPATRA:
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
CLEOPATRA:
Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
CLEOPATRA:
Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies
CLEOPATRA:
Blow me into abhorring! rather make
CLEOPATRA:
My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
CLEOPATRA:
And hang me up in chains!
PROCULEIUS:
You do extend
PROCULEIUS:
These thoughts of horror further than you shall
PROCULEIUS:
Find cause in Caesar.
PROCULEIUS:
Enter DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA:
Proculeius,
DOLABELLA:
What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
DOLABELLA:
And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,
DOLABELLA:
I'll take her to my guard.
PROCULEIUS:
So, Dolabella,
PROCULEIUS:
It shall content me best: be gentle to her.
PROCULEIUS:
To CLEOPATRA
PROCULEIUS:
To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
PROCULEIUS:
If you'll employ me to him.
CLEOPATRA:
Say, I would die.
CLEOPATRA:
Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers
DOLABELLA:
Most noble empress, you have heard of me?
CLEOPATRA:
I cannot tell.
DOLABELLA:
Assuredly you know me.
CLEOPATRA:
No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
CLEOPATRA:
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams,
CLEOPATRA:
Is't not your trick?
DOLABELLA:
I understand not, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony
CLEOPATRA:
O, such another sleep, that I might see
CLEOPATRA:
But such another man!
DOLABELLA:
If it might please ye,--
CLEOPATRA:
His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck
CLEOPATRA:
A sun and moon, which kept their course,
CLEOPATRA:
and lighted
CLEOPATRA:
The little O, the earth.
DOLABELLA:
Most sovereign creature,--
CLEOPATRA:
His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
CLEOPATRA:
Crested the world: his voice was propertied
CLEOPATRA:
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends,
CLEOPATRA:
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
CLEOPATRA:
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
CLEOPATRA:
There was no winter in't, an autumn 'twas
CLEOPATRA:
That grew the more by reaping: his delights
CLEOPATRA:
Were dolphin-like, they show'd his back above
CLEOPATRA:
The element they lived in: in his livery
CLEOPATRA:
Walk'd crowns and crownets, realms and islands were
CLEOPATRA:
As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
DOLABELLA:
Cleopatra!
CLEOPATRA:
Think you there was, or might be, such a man
CLEOPATRA:
As this I dream'd of?
DOLABELLA:
Gentle madam, no.
CLEOPATRA:
You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
CLEOPATRA:
But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
CLEOPATRA:
It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
CLEOPATRA:
To vie strange forms with fancy, yet, to imagine
CLEOPATRA:
And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
CLEOPATRA:
Condemning shadows quite.
DOLABELLA:
Hear me, good madam.
DOLABELLA:
Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it
DOLABELLA:
As answering to the weight: would I might never
DOLABELLA:
O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,
DOLABELLA:
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
DOLABELLA:
My very heart at root.
CLEOPATRA:
I thank you, sir,
CLEOPATRA:
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
DOLABELLA:
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, pray you, sir,--
DOLABELLA:
Though he be honourable,--
CLEOPATRA:
He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
DOLABELLA:
Madam, he will, I know't.
DOLABELLA:
Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'
DOLABELLA:
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Which is the Queen of Egypt?
DOLABELLA:
It is the emperor, madam.
DOLABELLA:
CLEOPATRA kneels
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Arise, you shall not kneel
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I pray you, rise, rise, Egypt.
CLEOPATRA:
Sir, the gods
CLEOPATRA:
Will have it thus, my master and my lord
CLEOPATRA:
I must obey.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Take to you no hard thoughts
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
The record of what injuries you did us,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
As things but done by chance.
CLEOPATRA:
Sole sir o' the world,
CLEOPATRA:
I cannot project mine own cause so well
CLEOPATRA:
To make it clear, but do confess I have
CLEOPATRA:
Been laden with like frailties which before
CLEOPATRA:
Have often shamed our sex.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Cleopatra, know,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
We will extenuate rather than enforce
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
If you apply yourself to our intents,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
A benefit in this change, but if you seek
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of my good purposes, and put your children
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
CLEOPATRA:
And may, through all the world: 'tis yours, and we,
CLEOPATRA:
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
CLEOPATRA:
Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
CLEOPATRA:
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
CLEOPATRA:
I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued,
CLEOPATRA:
Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
SELEUCUS:
Here, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
CLEOPATRA:
Upon his peril, that I have reserved
CLEOPATRA:
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.
SELEUCUS:
Madam,
SELEUCUS:
I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,
SELEUCUS:
Speak that which is not.
CLEOPATRA:
What have I kept back?
SELEUCUS:
Enough to purchase what you have made known.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra, I approve
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Your wisdom in the deed.
CLEOPATRA:
See, Caesar! O, behold,
CLEOPATRA:
How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours,
CLEOPATRA:
And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
CLEOPATRA:
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
CLEOPATRA:
Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
CLEOPATRA:
Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt
CLEOPATRA:
Go back, I warrant thee, but I'll catch thine eyes,
CLEOPATRA:
Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
CLEOPATRA:
O rarely base!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Good queen, let us entreat you.
CLEOPATRA:
O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
CLEOPATRA:
That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
CLEOPATRA:
Doing the honour of thy lordliness
CLEOPATRA:
To one so meek, that mine own servant should
CLEOPATRA:
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
CLEOPATRA:
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
CLEOPATRA:
That I some lady trifles have reserved,
CLEOPATRA:
Immoment toys, things of such dignity
CLEOPATRA:
As we greet modern friends withal, and say,
CLEOPATRA:
Some nobler token I have kept apart
CLEOPATRA:
For Livia and Octavia, to induce
CLEOPATRA:
Their mediation, must I be unfolded
CLEOPATRA:
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
CLEOPATRA:
Beneath the fall I have.
CLEOPATRA:
To SELEUCUS
CLEOPATRA:
Prithee, go hence,
CLEOPATRA:
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
CLEOPATRA:
Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
CLEOPATRA:
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Forbear, Seleucus.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exit SELEUCUS
CLEOPATRA:
Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
CLEOPATRA:
For things that others do, and, when we fall,
CLEOPATRA:
We answer others' merits in our name,
CLEOPATRA:
Are therefore to be pitied.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Cleopatra,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
For we intend so to dispose you as
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Our care and pity is so much upon you,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That we remain your friend, and so, adieu.
CLEOPATRA:
My master, and my lord!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Not so. Adieu.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train
CLEOPATRA:
He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
CLEOPATRA:
Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.
CLEOPATRA:
Whispers CHARMIAN
IRAS:
Finish, good lady, the bright day is done,
IRAS:
And we are for the dark.
CLEOPATRA:
Hie thee again
CLEOPATRA:
I have spoke already, and it is provided,
CLEOPATRA:
Go put it to the haste.
CHARMIAN:
Madam, I will.
CHARMIAN:
Re-enter DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA:
Where is the queen?
CHARMIAN:
Behold, sir.
CHARMIAN:
Exit
CLEOPATRA:
Dolabella!
DOLABELLA:
Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
DOLABELLA:
Which my love makes religion to obey,
DOLABELLA:
I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
DOLABELLA:
Intends his journey, and within three days
DOLABELLA:
You with your children will he send before
DOLABELLA:
Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
DOLABELLA:
Your pleasure and my promise.
CLEOPATRA:
Dolabella,
CLEOPATRA:
I shall remain your debtor.
DOLABELLA:
I your servant,
DOLABELLA:
Adieu, good queen, I must attend on Caesar.
CLEOPATRA:
Farewell, and thanks.
CLEOPATRA:
Exit DOLABELLA
CLEOPATRA:
Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
CLEOPATRA:
Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown
CLEOPATRA:
In Rome, as well as I	mechanic slaves
CLEOPATRA:
With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
CLEOPATRA:
Uplift us to the view, in their thick breaths,
CLEOPATRA:
Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,
CLEOPATRA:
And forced to drink their vapour.
IRAS:
The gods forbid!
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors
CLEOPATRA:
Will catch at us, like strumpets, and scald rhymers
CLEOPATRA:
Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
CLEOPATRA:
Extemporally will stage us, and present
CLEOPATRA:
Our Alexandrian revels, Antony
CLEOPATRA:
Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
CLEOPATRA:
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
CLEOPATRA:
I' the posture of a whore.
IRAS:
O the good gods!
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, that's certain.
IRAS:
I'll never see 't, for, I am sure, my nails
IRAS:
Are stronger than mine eyes.
CLEOPATRA:
Why, that's the way
CLEOPATRA:
To fool their preparation, and to conquer
CLEOPATRA:
Their most absurd intents.
CLEOPATRA:
Re-enter CHARMIAN
CLEOPATRA:
Now, Charmian!
CLEOPATRA:
Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
CLEOPATRA:
My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,
CLEOPATRA:
To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
CLEOPATRA:
Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed,
CLEOPATRA:
And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
CLEOPATRA:
To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
CLEOPATRA:
Wherefore's this noise?
CLEOPATRA:
Exit IRAS. A noise within
CLEOPATRA:
Enter a Guardsman
Guard:
Here is a rural fellow
Guard:
That will not be denied your highness presence
Guard:
He brings you figs.
CLEOPATRA:
Let him come in.
CLEOPATRA:
Exit Guardsman
CLEOPATRA:
What poor an instrument
CLEOPATRA:
May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
CLEOPATRA:
My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
CLEOPATRA:
Of woman in me: now from head to foot
CLEOPATRA:
I am marble-constant, now the fleeting moon
CLEOPATRA:
No planet is of mine.
CLEOPATRA:
Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket
Guard:
This is the man.
CLEOPATRA:
Avoid, and leave him.
CLEOPATRA:
Exit Guardsman
CLEOPATRA:
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
CLEOPATRA:
That kills and pains not?
Clown:
Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party
Clown:
that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
Clown:
is immortal, those that do die of it do seldom or
Clown:
never recover.
CLEOPATRA:
Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
Clown:
Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of
Clown:
them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
Clown:
but something given to lie, as a woman should not
Clown:
do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
Clown:
biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
Clown:
a very good report o' the worm, but he that will
Clown:
believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
Clown:
half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
Clown:
worm's an odd worm.
CLEOPATRA:
Get thee hence, farewell.
Clown:
I wish you all joy of the worm.
Clown:
Setting down his basket
CLEOPATRA:
Farewell.
Clown:
You must think this, look you, that the worm will
Clown:
do his kind.
CLEOPATRA:
Ay, ay, farewell.
Clown:
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
Clown:
keeping of wise people, for, indeed, there is no
Clown:
goodness in worm.
CLEOPATRA:
Take thou no care, it shall be heeded.
Clown:
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
Clown:
not worth the feeding.
CLEOPATRA:
Will it eat me?
Clown:
You must not think I am so simple but I know the
Clown:
devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
Clown:
woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
Clown:
not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
Clown:
gods great harm in their women, for in every ten
Clown:
that they make, the devils mar five.
CLEOPATRA:
Well, get thee gone, farewell.
Clown:
Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.
Clown:
Exit
Clown:
Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown,  and c
CLEOPATRA:
Give me my robe, put on my crown, I have
CLEOPATRA:
Immortal longings in me: now no more
CLEOPATRA:
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip
CLEOPATRA:
Yare, yare, good Iras, quick. Methinks I hear
CLEOPATRA:
Antony call, I see him rouse himself
CLEOPATRA:
To praise my noble act, I hear him mock
CLEOPATRA:
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
CLEOPATRA:
To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come
CLEOPATRA:
Now to that name my courage prove my title!
CLEOPATRA:
I am fire and air, my other elements
CLEOPATRA:
I give to baser life. So, have you done?
CLEOPATRA:
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
CLEOPATRA:
Farewell, kind Charmian, Iras, long farewell.
CLEOPATRA:
Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies
CLEOPATRA:
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
CLEOPATRA:
If thou and nature can so gently part,
CLEOPATRA:
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
CLEOPATRA:
Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
CLEOPATRA:
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
CLEOPATRA:
It is not worth leave-taking.
CHARMIAN:
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say,
CHARMIAN:
The gods themselves do weep!
CLEOPATRA:
This proves me base
CLEOPATRA:
If she first meet the curled Antony,
CLEOPATRA:
He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
CLEOPATRA:
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
CLEOPATRA:
mortal wretch,
CLEOPATRA:
To an asp, which she applies to her breast
CLEOPATRA:
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
CLEOPATRA:
Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
CLEOPATRA:
Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
CLEOPATRA:
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
CLEOPATRA:
Unpolicied!
CHARMIAN:
O eastern star!
CLEOPATRA:
Peace, peace!
CLEOPATRA:
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
CLEOPATRA:
That sucks the nurse asleep?
CHARMIAN:
O, break! O, break!
CLEOPATRA:
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--
CLEOPATRA:
O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.
CLEOPATRA:
Applying another asp to her arm
CLEOPATRA:
What should I stay--
CLEOPATRA:
Dies
CHARMIAN:
In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
CHARMIAN:
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
CHARMIAN:
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close,
CHARMIAN:
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
CHARMIAN:
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry,
CHARMIAN:
I'll mend it, and then play.
CHARMIAN:
Enter the Guard, rushing in
First Guard:
Where is the queen?
CHARMIAN:
Speak softly, wake her not.
First Guard:
Caesar hath sent--
CHARMIAN:
Too slow a messenger.
CHARMIAN:
Applies an asp
CHARMIAN:
O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.
First Guard:
Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
Second Guard:
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar, call him.
First Guard:
What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
CHARMIAN:
It is well done, and fitting for a princess
CHARMIAN:
Descended of so many royal kings.
CHARMIAN:
Ah, soldier!
CHARMIAN:
Dies
CHARMIAN:
Re-enter DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA:
How goes it here?
Second Guard:
All dead.
DOLABELLA:
Caesar, thy thoughts
DOLABELLA:
Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
DOLABELLA:
To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
DOLABELLA:
So sought'st to hinder.
DOLABELLA:
Within  'A way there, a way for Caesar!'
DOLABELLA:
Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching
DOLABELLA:
O sir, you are too sure an augurer,
DOLABELLA:
That you did fear is done.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Bravest at the last,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
I do not see them bleed.
DOLABELLA:
Who was last with them?
First Guard:
A simple countryman, that brought her figs
First Guard:
This was his basket.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Poison'd, then.
First Guard:
O Caesar,
First Guard:
This Charmian lived but now, she stood and spake
First Guard:
I found her trimming up the diadem
First Guard:
On her dead mistress, tremblingly she stood
First Guard:
And on the sudden dropp'd.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
O noble weakness!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
As she would catch another Antony
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
In her strong toil of grace.
DOLABELLA:
Here, on her breast,
DOLABELLA:
There is a vent of blood and something blown
DOLABELLA:
The like is on her arm.
First Guard:
This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
First Guard:
Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
First Guard:
Upon the caves of Nile.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Most probable
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
That so she died, for her physician tells me
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
She hath pursued conclusions infinite
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And bear her women from the monument
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
She shall be buried by her Antony
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
A pair so famous. High events as these
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Strike those that make them, and their story is
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
No less in pity than his glory which
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
In solemn show attend this funeral,
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
High order in this great solemnity.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:
Exeunt
