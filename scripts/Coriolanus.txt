DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
ACT I
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
SCENE I. Rome. A street.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS:
Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons
First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
All:
Speak, speak.
First Citizen:
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
All:
Resolved. resolved.
First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
All:
We know't, we know't.
First Citizen:
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
First Citizen:
Is't a verdict?
All:
No more talking on't, let it be done: away, away!
Second Citizen:
One word, good citizens.
First Citizen:
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
First Citizen:
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
First Citizen:
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
First Citizen:
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely,
First Citizen:
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
First Citizen:
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
First Citizen:
inventory to particularise their abundance, our
First Citizen:
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
First Citizen:
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
First Citizen:
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
Second Citizen:
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
All:
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
Second Citizen:
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
First Citizen:
Very well, and could be content to give him good
First Citizen:
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Second Citizen:
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
First Citizen:
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
First Citizen:
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
First Citizen:
content to say it was for his country he did it to
First Citizen:
please his mother and to be partly proud, which he
First Citizen:
is, even till the altitude of his virtue.
Second Citizen:
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
Second Citizen:
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
First Citizen:
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations,
First Citizen:
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
First Citizen:
Shouts within
First Citizen:
What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
First Citizen:
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
All:
Come, come.
First Citizen:
Soft! who comes here?
First Citizen:
Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA
Second Citizen:
Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always loved
Second Citizen:
the people.
First Citizen:
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
MENENIUS:
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
MENENIUS:
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
First Citizen:
Our business is not unknown to the senate, they have
First Citizen:
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
First Citizen:
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
First Citizen:
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
First Citizen:
have strong arms too.
MENENIUS:
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
MENENIUS:
Will you undo yourselves?
First Citizen:
We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
MENENIUS:
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
MENENIUS:
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
MENENIUS:
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
MENENIUS:
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
MENENIUS:
Against the Roman state, whose course will on
MENENIUS:
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
MENENIUS:
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
MENENIUS:
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
MENENIUS:
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
MENENIUS:
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
MENENIUS:
You are transported by calamity
MENENIUS:
Thither where more attends you, and you slander
MENENIUS:
The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
MENENIUS:
When you curse them as enemies.
First Citizen:
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
First Citizen:
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
First Citizen:
crammed with grain, make edicts for usury, to
First Citizen:
support usurers, repeal daily any wholesome act
First Citizen:
established against the rich, and provide more
First Citizen:
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
First Citizen:
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will, and
First Citizen:
there's all the love they bear us.
MENENIUS:
Either you must
MENENIUS:
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
MENENIUS:
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
MENENIUS:
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it,
MENENIUS:
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
MENENIUS:
To stale 't a little more.
First Citizen:
Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
First Citizen:
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
First Citizen:
you, deliver.
MENENIUS:
There was a time when all the body's members
MENENIUS:
Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it
MENENIUS:
That only like a gulf it did remain
MENENIUS:
I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
MENENIUS:
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
MENENIUS:
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
MENENIUS:
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
MENENIUS:
And, mutually participate, did minister
MENENIUS:
Unto the appetite and affection common
MENENIUS:
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
First Citizen:
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
MENENIUS:
Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
MENENIUS:
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
MENENIUS:
For, look you, I may make the belly smile
MENENIUS:
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
MENENIUS:
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
MENENIUS:
That envied his receipt, even so most fitly
MENENIUS:
As you malign our senators for that
MENENIUS:
They are not such as you.
First Citizen:
Your belly's answer? What!
First Citizen:
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
First Citizen:
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
First Citizen:
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
First Citizen:
With other muniments and petty helps
First Citizen:
In this our fabric, if that they--
MENENIUS:
What then?
MENENIUS:
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?
First Citizen:
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
First Citizen:
Who is the sink o' the body,--
MENENIUS:
Well, what then?
First Citizen:
The former agents, if they did complain,
First Citizen:
What could the belly answer?
MENENIUS:
I will tell you
MENENIUS:
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
MENENIUS:
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
First Citizen:
Ye're long about it.
MENENIUS:
Note me this, good friend,
MENENIUS:
Your most grave belly was deliberate,
MENENIUS:
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd
MENENIUS:
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
MENENIUS:
'That I receive the general food at first,
MENENIUS:
Which you do live upon, and fit it is,
MENENIUS:
Because I am the store-house and the shop
MENENIUS:
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
MENENIUS:
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
MENENIUS:
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain,
MENENIUS:
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
MENENIUS:
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
MENENIUS:
From me receive that natural competency
MENENIUS:
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
MENENIUS:
You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
First Citizen:
Ay, sir, well, well.
MENENIUS:
'Though all at once cannot
MENENIUS:
See what I do deliver out to each,
MENENIUS:
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
MENENIUS:
From me do back receive the flour of all,
MENENIUS:
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
First Citizen:
It was an answer: how apply you this?
MENENIUS:
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
MENENIUS:
And you the mutinous members, for examine
MENENIUS:
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
MENENIUS:
Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
MENENIUS:
No public benefit which you receive
MENENIUS:
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
MENENIUS:
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
MENENIUS:
You, the great toe of this assembly?
First Citizen:
I the great toe! why the great toe?
MENENIUS:
For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
MENENIUS:
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost
MENENIUS:
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
MENENIUS:
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
MENENIUS:
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
MENENIUS:
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle,
MENENIUS:
The one side must have bale.
MENENIUS:
Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
MENENIUS:
Hail, noble Marcius!
MARCIUS:
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
MARCIUS:
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
MARCIUS:
Make yourselves scabs?
First Citizen:
We have ever your good word.
MARCIUS:
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
MARCIUS:
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
MARCIUS:
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
MARCIUS:
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
MARCIUS:
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares,
MARCIUS:
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
MARCIUS:
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
MARCIUS:
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
MARCIUS:
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
MARCIUS:
And curse that justice did it.
MARCIUS:
Who deserves greatness
MARCIUS:
Deserves your hate, and your affections are
MARCIUS:
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
MARCIUS:
Which would increase his evil. He that depends
MARCIUS:
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
MARCIUS:
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
MARCIUS:
With every minute you do change a mind,
MARCIUS:
And call him noble that was now your hate,
MARCIUS:
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
MARCIUS:
That in these several places of the city
MARCIUS:
You cry against the noble senate, who,
MARCIUS:
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
MARCIUS:
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
MENENIUS:
For corn at their own rates, whereof, they say,
MENENIUS:
The city is well stored.
MARCIUS:
Hang 'em! They say!
MARCIUS:
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
MARCIUS:
What's done i' the Capitol, who's like to rise,
MARCIUS:
Who thrives and who declines, side factions
MARCIUS:
and give out
MARCIUS:
Conjectural marriages, making parties strong
MARCIUS:
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
MARCIUS:
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
MARCIUS:
grain enough!
MARCIUS:
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
MARCIUS:
And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
MARCIUS:
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
MARCIUS:
As I could pick my lance.
MENENIUS:
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded,
MENENIUS:
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
MENENIUS:
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
MENENIUS:
What says the other troop?
MARCIUS:
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
MARCIUS:
They said they were an-hungry, sigh'd forth proverbs,
MARCIUS:
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
MARCIUS:
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
MARCIUS:
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
MARCIUS:
They vented their complainings, which being answer'd,
MARCIUS:
And a petition granted them, a strange one--
MARCIUS:
To break the heart of generosity,
MARCIUS:
And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
MARCIUS:
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
MARCIUS:
Shouting their emulation.
MENENIUS:
What is granted them?
MARCIUS:
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
MARCIUS:
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
MARCIUS:
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
MARCIUS:
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
MARCIUS:
Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
MARCIUS:
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
MARCIUS:
For insurrection's arguing.
MENENIUS:
This is strange.
MARCIUS:
Go, get you home, you fragments!
MARCIUS:
Enter a Messenger, hastily
Messenger:
Where's Caius Marcius?
MARCIUS:
Here: what's the matter?
Messenger:
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
MARCIUS:
I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
MARCIUS:
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
MARCIUS:
Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators, JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS
First Senator:
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us,
First Senator:
The Volsces are in arms.
MARCIUS:
They have a leader,
MARCIUS:
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
MARCIUS:
I sin in envying his nobility,
MARCIUS:
And were I any thing but what I am,
MARCIUS:
I would wish me only he.
COMINIUS:
You have fought together.
MARCIUS:
Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
MARCIUS:
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
MARCIUS:
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
MARCIUS:
That I am proud to hunt.
First Senator:
Then, worthy Marcius,
First Senator:
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
COMINIUS:
It is your former promise.
MARCIUS:
Sir, it is,
MARCIUS:
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
MARCIUS:
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
MARCIUS:
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
TITUS:
No, Caius Marcius,
TITUS:
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
TITUS:
Ere stay behind this business.
MENENIUS:
O, true-bred!
First Senator:
Your company to the Capitol, where, I know,
First Senator:
Our greatest friends attend us.
TITUS:
[To COMINIUS]                Lead you on.
TITUS:
To MARCIUS
TITUS:
Right worthy you priority.
COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius!
First Senator:
[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes, be gone!
MARCIUS:
Nay, let them follow
MARCIUS:
The Volsces have much corn, take these rats thither
MARCIUS:
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
MARCIUS:
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.
MARCIUS:
Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
SICINIUS:
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
BRUTUS:
He has no equal.
SICINIUS:
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
BRUTUS:
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
SICINIUS:
Nay. but his taunts.
BRUTUS:
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
SICINIUS:
Be-mock the modest moon.
BRUTUS:
The present wars devour him: he is grown
BRUTUS:
Too proud to be so valiant.
SICINIUS:
Such a nature,
SICINIUS:
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
SICINIUS:
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
SICINIUS:
His insolence can brook to be commanded
SICINIUS:
Under Cominius.
BRUTUS:
Fame, at the which he aims,
BRUTUS:
In whom already he's well graced, can not
BRUTUS:
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
BRUTUS:
A place below the first: for what miscarries
BRUTUS:
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
BRUTUS:
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
BRUTUS:
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
BRUTUS:
Had borne the business!'
SICINIUS:
Besides, if things go well,
SICINIUS:
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
SICINIUS:
Of his demerits rob Cominius.
BRUTUS:
Come
BRUTUS:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
BRUTUS:
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
BRUTUS:
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
BRUTUS:
In aught he merit not.
SICINIUS:
Let's hence, and hear
SICINIUS:
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
SICINIUS:
More than his singularity, he goes
SICINIUS:
Upon this present action.
BRUTUS:
Lets along.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt
BRUTUS:
SCENE II. Corioli. The Senate-house.
BRUTUS:
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators
First Senator:
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
First Senator:
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
First Senator:
And know how we proceed.
AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
AUFIDIUS:
What ever have been thought on in this state,
AUFIDIUS:
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
AUFIDIUS:
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
AUFIDIUS:
Since I heard thence, these are the words: I think
AUFIDIUS:
I have the letter here, yes, here it is.
AUFIDIUS:
Reads
AUFIDIUS:
'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
AUFIDIUS:
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great,
AUFIDIUS:
The people mutinous, and it is rumour'd,
AUFIDIUS:
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
AUFIDIUS:
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
AUFIDIUS:
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
AUFIDIUS:
These three lead on this preparation
AUFIDIUS:
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you
AUFIDIUS:
Consider of it.'
First Senator:
Our army's in the field
First Senator:
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
First Senator:
To answer us.
AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it folly
AUFIDIUS:
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
AUFIDIUS:
They needs must show themselves, which
AUFIDIUS:
in the hatching,
AUFIDIUS:
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
AUFIDIUS:
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
AUFIDIUS:
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
AUFIDIUS:
Should know we were afoot.
Second Senator:
Noble Aufidius,
Second Senator:
Take your commission, hie you to your bands
Second Senator:
Let us alone to guard Corioli
Second Senator:
If they set down before 's, for the remove
Second Senator:
Bring your army, but, I think, you'll find
Second Senator:
They've not prepared for us.
AUFIDIUS:
O, doubt not that,
AUFIDIUS:
I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
AUFIDIUS:
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
AUFIDIUS:
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
AUFIDIUS:
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
AUFIDIUS:
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
AUFIDIUS:
Till one can do no more.
All:
The gods assist you!
AUFIDIUS:
And keep your honours safe!
First Senator:
Farewell.
Second Senator:
Farewell.
All:
Farewell.
All:
Exeunt
All:
SCENE III. Rome. A room in Marcius' house.
All:
Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA	they set them down on two low stools, and sew
VOLUMNIA:
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a
VOLUMNIA:
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
VOLUMNIA:
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
VOLUMNIA:
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
VOLUMNIA:
he would show most love. When yet he was but
VOLUMNIA:
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
VOLUMNIA:
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
VOLUMNIA:
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
VOLUMNIA:
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
VOLUMNIA:
how honour would become such a person. that it was
VOLUMNIA:
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
VOLUMNIA:
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
VOLUMNIA:
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
VOLUMNIA:
war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows
VOLUMNIA:
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
VOLUMNIA:
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
VOLUMNIA:
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
VOLUMNIA:
man.
VIRGILIA:
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
VOLUMNIA:
Then his good report should have been my son, I
VOLUMNIA:
therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
VOLUMNIA:
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
VOLUMNIA:
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
VOLUMNIA:
Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
VOLUMNIA:
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
VOLUMNIA:
Enter a Gentlewoman
Gentlewoman:
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
VIRGILIA:
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, you shall not.
VOLUMNIA:
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
VOLUMNIA:
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
VOLUMNIA:
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him
VOLUMNIA:
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus
VOLUMNIA:
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
VOLUMNIA:
Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
VOLUMNIA:
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
VOLUMNIA:
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
VOLUMNIA:
Or all or lose his hire.
VIRGILIA:
His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
VOLUMNIA:
Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
VOLUMNIA:
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
VOLUMNIA:
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
VOLUMNIA:
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
VOLUMNIA:
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
VOLUMNIA:
We are fit to bid her welcome.
VOLUMNIA:
Exit Gentlewoman
VIRGILIA:
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
VOLUMNIA:
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
VOLUMNIA:
And tread upon his neck.
VOLUMNIA:
Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman
VALERIA:
My ladies both, good day to you.
VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam.
VIRGILIA:
I am glad to see your ladyship.
VALERIA:
How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
VALERIA:
What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
VALERIA:
faith. How does your little son?
VIRGILIA:
I thank your ladyship, well, good madam.
VOLUMNIA:
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
VOLUMNIA:
look upon his school-master.
VALERIA:
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
VALERIA:
very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
VALERIA:
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
VALERIA:
confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
VALERIA:
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
VALERIA:
again, and after it again, and over and over he
VALERIA:
comes, and again, catched it again, or whether his
VALERIA:
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
VALERIA:
teeth and tear it, O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
VALERIA:
it!
VOLUMNIA:
One on 's father's moods.
VALERIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.
VALERIA:
Come, lay aside your stitchery, I must have you play
VALERIA:
the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
VIRGILIA:
No, good madam, I will not out of doors.
VALERIA:
Not out of doors!
VOLUMNIA:
She shall, she shall.
VIRGILIA:
Indeed, no, by your patience, I'll not over the
VIRGILIA:
threshold till my lord return from the wars.
VALERIA:
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
VALERIA:
you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
VIRGILIA:
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
VIRGILIA:
my prayers, but I cannot go thither.
VOLUMNIA:
Why, I pray you?
VIRGILIA:
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
VALERIA:
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
VALERIA:
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
VALERIA:
Ithaca full of moths. Come, I would your cambric
VALERIA:
were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
VALERIA:
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
VIRGILIA:
No, good madam, pardon me, indeed, I will not forth.
VALERIA:
In truth, la, go with me, and I'll tell you
VALERIA:
excellent news of your husband.
VIRGILIA:
O, good madam, there can be none yet.
VALERIA:
Verily, I do not jest with you, there came news from
VALERIA:
him last night.
VIRGILIA:
Indeed, madam?
VALERIA:
In earnest, it's true, I heard a senator speak it.
VALERIA:
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth, against
VALERIA:
whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
VALERIA:
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
VALERIA:
down before their city Corioli, they nothing doubt
VALERIA:
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
VALERIA:
on mine honour, and so, I pray, go with us.
VIRGILIA:
Give me excuse, good madam, I will obey you in every
VIRGILIA:
thing hereafter.
VOLUMNIA:
Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
VOLUMNIA:
disease our better mirth.
VALERIA:
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
VALERIA:
Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
VALERIA:
solemness out o' door. and go along with us.
VIRGILIA:
No, at a word, madam, indeed, I must not. I wish
VIRGILIA:
you much mirth.
VALERIA:
Well, then, farewell.
VALERIA:
Exeunt
VALERIA:
SCENE IV. Before Corioli.
VALERIA:
Enter, with drum and colours, MARCIUS, TITUS  LARTIUS, Captains and Soldiers. To them a Messenger
MARCIUS:
Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, no.
MARCIUS:
'Tis done.
LARTIUS:
Agreed.
MARCIUS:
Say, has our general met the enemy?
Messenger:
They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.
LARTIUS:
So, the good horse is mine.
MARCIUS:
I'll buy him of you.
LARTIUS:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
LARTIUS:
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
MARCIUS:
How far off lie these armies?
Messenger:
Within this mile and half.
MARCIUS:
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
MARCIUS:
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
MARCIUS:
That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
MARCIUS:
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
MARCIUS:
They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls
MARCIUS:
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
First Senator:
No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
First Senator:
That's lesser than a little.
First Senator:
Drums afar off
First Senator:
Hark! our drums
First Senator:
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
First Senator:
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
First Senator:
Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes,
First Senator:
They'll open of themselves.
First Senator:
Alarum afar off
First Senator:
Hark you. far off!
First Senator:
There is Aufidius, list, what work he makes
First Senator:
Amongst your cloven army.
MARCIUS:
O, they are at it!
LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
LARTIUS:
Enter the army of the Volsces
MARCIUS:
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
MARCIUS:
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
MARCIUS:
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
MARCIUS:
brave Titus
MARCIUS:
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
MARCIUS:
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows
MARCIUS:
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
MARCIUS:
And he shall feel mine edge.
MARCIUS:
Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing
MARCIUS:
All the contagion of the south light on you,
MARCIUS:
You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
MARCIUS:
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
MARCIUS:
Further than seen and one infect another
MARCIUS:
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
MARCIUS:
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
MARCIUS:
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
MARCIUS:
All hurt behind, backs red, and faces pale
MARCIUS:
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
MARCIUS:
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
MARCIUS:
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on,
MARCIUS:
If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
MARCIUS:
As they us to our trenches followed.
MARCIUS:
Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows them to the gates
MARCIUS:
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds
MARCIUS:
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
MARCIUS:
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.
MARCIUS:
Enters the gates
First Soldier:
Fool-hardiness, not I.
Second Soldier:
Nor I.
Second Soldier:
MARCIUS is shut in
First Soldier:
See, they have shut him in.
All:
To the pot, I warrant him.
All:
Alarum continues
All:
Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS
LARTIUS:
What is become of Marcius?
All:
Slain, sir, doubtless.
First Soldier:
Following the fliers at the very heels,
First Soldier:
With them he enters, who, upon the sudden,
First Soldier:
Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
First Soldier:
To answer all the city.
LARTIUS:
O noble fellow!
LARTIUS:
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
LARTIUS:
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius
LARTIUS:
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
LARTIUS:
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
LARTIUS:
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
LARTIUS:
Only in strokes, but, with thy grim looks and
LARTIUS:
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
LARTIUS:
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
LARTIUS:
Were feverous and did tremble.
LARTIUS:
Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy
First Soldier:
Look, sir.
LARTIUS:
O,'tis Marcius!
LARTIUS:
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
LARTIUS:
They fight, and all enter the city
LARTIUS:
SCENE V. Corioli. A street.
LARTIUS:
Enter certain Romans, with spoils
First Roman:
This will I carry to Rome.
Second Roman:
And I this.
Third Roman:
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
Third Roman:
Alarum continues still afar off
Third Roman:
Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet
MARCIUS:
See here these movers that do prize their hours
MARCIUS:
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
MARCIUS:
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
MARCIUS:
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
MARCIUS:
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
MARCIUS:
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
MARCIUS:
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
MARCIUS:
Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
MARCIUS:
Convenient numbers to make good the city,
MARCIUS:
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
MARCIUS:
To help Cominius.
LARTIUS:
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st,
LARTIUS:
Thy exercise hath been too violent for
LARTIUS:
A second course of fight.
MARCIUS:
Sir, praise me not,
MARCIUS:
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well
MARCIUS:
The blood I drop is rather physical
MARCIUS:
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
MARCIUS:
I will appear, and fight.
LARTIUS:
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
LARTIUS:
Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms
LARTIUS:
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
LARTIUS:
Prosperity be thy page!
MARCIUS:
Thy friend no less
MARCIUS:
Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest Marcius!
LARTIUS:
Exit MARCIUS
LARTIUS:
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place,
LARTIUS:
Call thither all the officers o' the town,
LARTIUS:
Where they shall know our mind: away!
LARTIUS:
Exeunt
LARTIUS:
SCENE VI. Near the camp of Cominius.
LARTIUS:
Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers
COMINIUS:
Breathe you, my friends: well fought,
COMINIUS:
we are come off
COMINIUS:
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
COMINIUS:
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
COMINIUS:
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
COMINIUS:
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
COMINIUS:
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
COMINIUS:
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
COMINIUS:
That both our powers, with smiling
COMINIUS:
fronts encountering,
COMINIUS:
May give you thankful sacrifice.
COMINIUS:
Enter a Messenger
COMINIUS:
Thy news?
Messenger:
The citizens of Corioli have issued,
Messenger:
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle
Messenger:
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
Messenger:
And then I came away.
COMINIUS:
Though thou speak'st truth,
COMINIUS:
Methinks thou speak'st not well.
COMINIUS:
How long is't since?
Messenger:
Above an hour, my lord.
COMINIUS:
'Tis not a mile, briefly we heard their drums
COMINIUS:
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
COMINIUS:
And bring thy news so late?
Messenger:
Spies of the Volsces
Messenger:
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
Messenger:
Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Messenger:
Half an hour since brought my report.
COMINIUS:
Who's yonder,
COMINIUS:
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
COMINIUS:
He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have
COMINIUS:
Before-time seen him thus.
MARCIUS:
[Within]                 Come I too late?
COMINIUS:
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
COMINIUS:
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
COMINIUS:
From every meaner man.
COMINIUS:
Enter MARCIUS
MARCIUS:
Come I too late?
COMINIUS:
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
COMINIUS:
But mantled in your own.
MARCIUS:
O, let me clip ye
MARCIUS:
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
MARCIUS:
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
MARCIUS:
And tapers burn'd to bedward!
COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
COMINIUS:
How is it with Titus Lartius?
MARCIUS:
As with a man busied about decrees
MARCIUS:
Condemning some to death, and some to exile,
MARCIUS:
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other,
MARCIUS:
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
MARCIUS:
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
MARCIUS:
To let him slip at will.
COMINIUS:
Where is that slave
COMINIUS:
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
COMINIUS:
Where is he? call him hither.
MARCIUS:
Let him alone,
MARCIUS:
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
MARCIUS:
The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
MARCIUS:
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
MARCIUS:
From rascals worse than they.
COMINIUS:
But how prevail'd you?
MARCIUS:
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
MARCIUS:
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
MARCIUS:
If not, why cease you till you are so?
COMINIUS:
Marcius,
COMINIUS:
We have at disadvantage fought and did
COMINIUS:
Retire to win our purpose.
MARCIUS:
How lies their battle? know you on which side
MARCIUS:
They have placed their men of trust?
COMINIUS:
As I guess, Marcius,
COMINIUS:
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
COMINIUS:
Of their best trust, o'er them Aufidius,
COMINIUS:
Their very heart of hope.
MARCIUS:
I do beseech you,
MARCIUS:
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
MARCIUS:
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
MARCIUS:
We have made to endure friends, that you directly
MARCIUS:
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates,
MARCIUS:
And that you not delay the present, but,
MARCIUS:
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
MARCIUS:
We prove this very hour.
COMINIUS:
Though I could wish
COMINIUS:
You were conducted to a gentle bath
COMINIUS:
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
COMINIUS:
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
COMINIUS:
That best can aid your action.
MARCIUS:
Those are they
MARCIUS:
That most are willing. If any such be here--
MARCIUS:
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
MARCIUS:
Wherein you see me smear'd, if any fear
MARCIUS:
Lesser his person than an ill report,
MARCIUS:
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
MARCIUS:
And that his country's dearer than himself,
MARCIUS:
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
MARCIUS:
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
MARCIUS:
And follow Marcius.
MARCIUS:
They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps
MARCIUS:
O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
MARCIUS:
If these shows be not outward, which of you
MARCIUS:
But is four Volsces? none of you but is
MARCIUS:
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
MARCIUS:
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
MARCIUS:
Though thanks to all, must I select
MARCIUS:
from all: the rest
MARCIUS:
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
MARCIUS:
As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march,
MARCIUS:
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
MARCIUS:
Which men are best inclined.
COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows
COMINIUS:
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
COMINIUS:
Divide in all with us.
COMINIUS:
Exeunt
COMINIUS:
SCENE VII. The gates of Corioli.
COMINIUS:
TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon  Corioli, going with drum and trumpet toward  COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with Lieutenant, other Soldiers, and a Scout
LARTIUS:
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
LARTIUS:
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
LARTIUS:
Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
LARTIUS:
For a short holding: if we lose the field,
LARTIUS:
We cannot keep the town.
Lieutenant:
Fear not our care, sir.
LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
LARTIUS:
Our guider, come, to the Roman camp conduct us.
LARTIUS:
Exeunt
LARTIUS:
SCENE VIII. A field of battle.
LARTIUS:
Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides, MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS
MARCIUS:
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
MARCIUS:
Worse than a promise-breaker.
AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike
AUFIDIUS:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
AUFIDIUS:
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
MARCIUS:
Let the first budger die the other's slave,
MARCIUS:
And the gods doom him after!
AUFIDIUS:
If I fly, Marcius,
AUFIDIUS:
Holloa me like a hare.
MARCIUS:
Within these three hours, Tullus,
MARCIUS:
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
MARCIUS:
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
MARCIUS:
Wherein thou seest me mask'd, for thy revenge
MARCIUS:
Wrench up thy power to the highest.
AUFIDIUS:
Wert thou the Hector
AUFIDIUS:
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
AUFIDIUS:
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
AUFIDIUS:
They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of  AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in breathless
AUFIDIUS:
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
AUFIDIUS:
In your condemned seconds.
AUFIDIUS:
Exeunt
AUFIDIUS:
SCENE IX. The Roman camp.
AUFIDIUS:
Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish.  Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans, from the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf
COMINIUS:
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
COMINIUS:
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
COMINIUS:
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
COMINIUS:
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
COMINIUS:
I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
COMINIUS:
And, gladly quaked, hear more, where the
COMINIUS:
dull tribunes,
COMINIUS:
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
COMINIUS:
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
COMINIUS:
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
COMINIUS:
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
COMINIUS:
Having fully dined before.
COMINIUS:
Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit
LARTIUS:
O general,
LARTIUS:
Here is the steed, we the caparison
LARTIUS:
Hadst thou beheld--
MARCIUS:
Pray now, no more: my mother,
MARCIUS:
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
MARCIUS:
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
MARCIUS:
As you have done, that's what I can, induced
MARCIUS:
As you have been, that's for my country
MARCIUS:
He that has but effected his good will
MARCIUS:
Hath overta'en mine act.
COMINIUS:
You shall not be
COMINIUS:
The grave of your deserving, Rome must know
COMINIUS:
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
COMINIUS:
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
COMINIUS:
To hide your doings, and to silence that,
COMINIUS:
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
COMINIUS:
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
COMINIUS:
In sign of what you are, not to reward
COMINIUS:
What you have done--before our army hear me.
MARCIUS:
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
MARCIUS:
To hear themselves remember'd.
COMINIUS:
Should they not,
COMINIUS:
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
COMINIUS:
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
COMINIUS:
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
COMINIUS:
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
COMINIUS:
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
COMINIUS:
Before the common distribution, at
COMINIUS:
Your only choice.
MARCIUS:
I thank you, general,
MARCIUS:
But cannot make my heart consent to take
MARCIUS:
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it,
MARCIUS:
And stand upon my common part with those
MARCIUS:
That have beheld the doing.
MARCIUS:
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'  cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare
MARCIUS:
May these same instruments, which you profane,
MARCIUS:
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
MARCIUS:
I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
MARCIUS:
Made all of false-faced soothing!
MARCIUS:
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
MARCIUS:
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
MARCIUS:
No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
MARCIUS:
My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
MARCIUS:
Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
MARCIUS:
You shout me forth
MARCIUS:
In acclamations hyperbolical,
MARCIUS:
As if I loved my little should be dieted
MARCIUS:
In praises sauced with lies.
COMINIUS:
Too modest are you,
COMINIUS:
More cruel to your good report than grateful
COMINIUS:
To us that give you truly: by your patience,
COMINIUS:
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
COMINIUS:
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
COMINIUS:
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
COMINIUS:
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
COMINIUS:
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
COMINIUS:
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
COMINIUS:
With all his trim belonging, and from this time,
COMINIUS:
For what he did before Corioli, call him,
COMINIUS:
With all the applause and clamour of the host,
COMINIUS:
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
COMINIUS:
The addition nobly ever!
COMINIUS:
Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums
All:
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
CORIOLANUS:
I will go wash,
CORIOLANUS:
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
CORIOLANUS:
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
CORIOLANUS:
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
CORIOLANUS:
To undercrest your good addition
CORIOLANUS:
To the fairness of my power.
COMINIUS:
So, to our tent,
COMINIUS:
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
COMINIUS:
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
COMINIUS:
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
COMINIUS:
The best, with whom we may articulate,
COMINIUS:
For their own good and ours.
LARTIUS:
I shall, my lord.
CORIOLANUS:
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
CORIOLANUS:
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
CORIOLANUS:
Of my lord general.
COMINIUS:
Take't, 'tis yours. What is't?
CORIOLANUS:
I sometime lay here in Corioli
CORIOLANUS:
At a poor man's house, he used me kindly
CORIOLANUS:
He cried to me, I saw him prisoner,
CORIOLANUS:
But then Aufidius was with in my view,
CORIOLANUS:
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
CORIOLANUS:
To give my poor host freedom.
COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
COMINIUS:
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
COMINIUS:
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
LARTIUS:
Marcius, his name?
CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
CORIOLANUS:
I am weary, yea, my memory is tired.
CORIOLANUS:
Have we no wine here?
COMINIUS:
Go we to our tent
COMINIUS:
The blood upon your visage dries, 'tis time
COMINIUS:
It should be look'd to: come.
COMINIUS:
Exeunt
COMINIUS:
SCENE X. The camp of the Volsces.
COMINIUS:
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, bloody, with two or three Soldiers
AUFIDIUS:
The town is ta'en!
First Soldier:
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
AUFIDIUS:
Condition!
AUFIDIUS:
I would I were a Roman, for I cannot,
AUFIDIUS:
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
AUFIDIUS:
What good condition can a treaty find
AUFIDIUS:
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
AUFIDIUS:
I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
AUFIDIUS:
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
AUFIDIUS:
As often as we eat. By the elements,
AUFIDIUS:
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
AUFIDIUS:
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
AUFIDIUS:
Hath not that honour in't it had, for where
AUFIDIUS:
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
AUFIDIUS:
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
AUFIDIUS:
Or wrath or craft may get him.
First Soldier:
He's the devil.
AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
AUFIDIUS:
With only suffering stain by him, for him
AUFIDIUS:
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
AUFIDIUS:
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
AUFIDIUS:
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
AUFIDIUS:
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
AUFIDIUS:
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
AUFIDIUS:
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
AUFIDIUS:
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
AUFIDIUS:
Against the hospitable canon, would I
AUFIDIUS:
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city,
AUFIDIUS:
Learn how 'tis held, and what they are that must
AUFIDIUS:
Be hostages for Rome.
First Soldier:
Will not you go?
AUFIDIUS:
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
AUFIDIUS:
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
AUFIDIUS:
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
AUFIDIUS:
I may spur on my journey.
First Soldier:
I shall, sir.
First Soldier:
Exeunt
First Soldier:
ACT II
First Soldier:
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.
First Soldier:
Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS.
MENENIUS:
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
BRUTUS:
Good or bad?
MENENIUS:
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
MENENIUS:
love not Marcius.
SICINIUS:
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
MENENIUS:
Pray you, who does the wolf love?
SICINIUS:
The lamb.
MENENIUS:
Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the
MENENIUS:
noble Marcius.
BRUTUS:
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
MENENIUS:
He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
MENENIUS:
are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
Both:
Well, sir.
MENENIUS:
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
MENENIUS:
have not in abundance?
BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.
BRUTUS:
And topping all others in boasting.
MENENIUS:
This is strange now: do you two know how you are
MENENIUS:
censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
MENENIUS:
right-hand file? do you?
Both:
Why, how are we censured?
MENENIUS:
Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?
Both:
Well, well, sir, well.
MENENIUS:
Why, 'tis no great matter, for a very little thief of
MENENIUS:
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience
MENENIUS:
give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
MENENIUS:
your pleasures, at the least if you take it as a
MENENIUS:
pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
MENENIUS:
being proud?
BRUTUS:
We do it not alone, sir.
MENENIUS:
I know you can do very little alone, for your helps
MENENIUS:
are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
MENENIUS:
single: your abilities are too infant-like for
MENENIUS:
doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
MENENIUS:
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
MENENIUS:
and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
MENENIUS:
O that you could!
BRUTUS:
What then, sir?
MENENIUS:
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
MENENIUS:
proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
MENENIUS:
any in Rome.
SICINIUS:
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
MENENIUS:
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
MENENIUS:
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
MENENIUS:
Tiber in't, said to be something imperfect in
MENENIUS:
favouring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like
MENENIUS:
upon too trivial motion, one that converses more
MENENIUS:
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
MENENIUS:
of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
MENENIUS:
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
MENENIUS:
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
MENENIUS:
you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
MENENIUS:
crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
MENENIUS:
delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
MENENIUS:
compound with the major part of your syllables: and
MENENIUS:
though I must be content to bear with those that say
MENENIUS:
you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
MENENIUS:
tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
MENENIUS:
the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
MENENIUS:
well enough too? what barm can your bisson
MENENIUS:
conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
MENENIUS:
known well enough too?
BRUTUS:
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
MENENIUS:
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
MENENIUS:
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
MENENIUS:
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
MENENIUS:
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller,
MENENIUS:
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
MENENIUS:
second day of audience. When you are hearing a
MENENIUS:
matter between party and party, if you chance to be
MENENIUS:
pinched with the colic, you make faces like
MENENIUS:
mummers, set up the bloody flag against all
MENENIUS:
patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
MENENIUS:
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
MENENIUS:
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
MENENIUS:
cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
MENENIUS:
a pair of strange ones.
BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are well understood to be a
BRUTUS:
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
BRUTUS:
bencher in the Capitol.
MENENIUS:
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
MENENIUS:
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
MENENIUS:
you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
MENENIUS:
wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not
MENENIUS:
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
MENENIUS:
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
MENENIUS:
saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud,
MENENIUS:
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
MENENIUS:
since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
MENENIUS:
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
MENENIUS:
your worships: more of your conversation would
MENENIUS:
infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
MENENIUS:
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
MENENIUS:
BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside
MENENIUS:
Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA
MENENIUS:
How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
MENENIUS:
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
MENENIUS:
your eyes so fast?
VOLUMNIA:
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches, for
VOLUMNIA:
the love of Juno, let's go.
MENENIUS:
Ha! Marcius coming home!
VOLUMNIA:
Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous
VOLUMNIA:
approbation.
MENENIUS:
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
MENENIUS:
Marcius coming home!
VIRGILIA:
Nay,'tis true.
VOLUMNIA:
Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
VOLUMNIA:
another, his wife another, and, I think, there's one
VOLUMNIA:
at home for you.
MENENIUS:
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
MENENIUS:
me!
VIRGILIA:
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you, I saw't.
MENENIUS:
A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
MENENIUS:
years' health, in which time I will make a lip at
MENENIUS:
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
MENENIUS:
Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
MENENIUS:
of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
MENENIUS:
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
VIRGILIA:
O, no, no, no.
VOLUMNIA:
O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't.
MENENIUS:
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
MENENIUS:
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
VOLUMNIA:
On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
VOLUMNIA:
with the oaken garland.
MENENIUS:
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
VOLUMNIA:
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
VOLUMNIA:
Aufidius got off.
MENENIUS:
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that
MENENIUS:
an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
MENENIUS:
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
MENENIUS:
that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes, the senate
VOLUMNIA:
has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
VOLUMNIA:
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
VOLUMNIA:
action outdone his former deeds doubly
VALERIA:
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
MENENIUS:
Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
MENENIUS:
true purchasing.
VIRGILIA:
The gods grant them true!
VOLUMNIA:
True! pow, wow.
MENENIUS:
True! I'll be sworn they are true.
MENENIUS:
Where is he wounded?
MENENIUS:
To the Tribunes
MENENIUS:
God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
MENENIUS:
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
VOLUMNIA:
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
VOLUMNIA:
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
VOLUMNIA:
stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
VOLUMNIA:
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
MENENIUS:
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
MENENIUS:
nine that I know.
VOLUMNIA:
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
VOLUMNIA:
wounds upon him.
MENENIUS:
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
MENENIUS:
A shout and flourish
MENENIUS:
Hark! the trumpets.
VOLUMNIA:
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
VOLUMNIA:
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears
VOLUMNIA:
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie,
VOLUMNIA:
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
VOLUMNIA:
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the  general, and TITUS LARTIUS, between them, CORIOLANUS,  crowned with an oaken garland, with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald
Herald:
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Herald:
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
Herald:
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius, these
Herald:
In honour follows Coriolanus.
Herald:
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
Herald:
Flourish
All:
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
CORIOLANUS:
No more of this, it does offend my heart
CORIOLANUS:
Pray now, no more.
COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your mother!
CORIOLANUS:
O,
CORIOLANUS:
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
CORIOLANUS:
For my prosperity!
CORIOLANUS:
Kneels
VOLUMNIA:
Nay, my good soldier, up,
VOLUMNIA:
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
VOLUMNIA:
By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
VOLUMNIA:
What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
VOLUMNIA:
But O, thy wife!
CORIOLANUS:
My gracious silence, hail!
CORIOLANUS:
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
CORIOLANUS:
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
CORIOLANUS:
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
CORIOLANUS:
And mothers that lack sons.
MENENIUS:
Now, the gods crown thee!
CORIOLANUS:
And live you yet?
CORIOLANUS:
To VALERIA
CORIOLANUS:
O my sweet lady, pardon.
VOLUMNIA:
I know not where to turn: O, welcome home
VOLUMNIA:
And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
MENENIUS:
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
MENENIUS:
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
MENENIUS:
A curse begin at very root on's heart,
MENENIUS:
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
MENENIUS:
That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
MENENIUS:
We have some old crab-trees here
MENENIUS:
at home that will not
MENENIUS:
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors
MENENIUS:
We call a nettle but a nettle and
MENENIUS:
The faults of fools but folly.
COMINIUS:
Ever right.
CORIOLANUS:
Menenius ever, ever.
Herald:
Give way there, and go on!
CORIOLANUS:
[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA]  Your hand, and yours
CORIOLANUS:
Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
CORIOLANUS:
The good patricians must be visited,
CORIOLANUS:
From whom I have received not only greetings,
CORIOLANUS:
But with them change of honours.
VOLUMNIA:
I have lived
VOLUMNIA:
To see inherited my very wishes
VOLUMNIA:
And the buildings of my fancy: only
VOLUMNIA:
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
VOLUMNIA:
Our Rome will cast upon thee.
CORIOLANUS:
Know, good mother,
CORIOLANUS:
I had rather be their servant in my way,
CORIOLANUS:
Than sway with them in theirs.
COMINIUS:
On, to the Capitol!
COMINIUS:
Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before. BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward
BRUTUS:
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
BRUTUS:
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
BRUTUS:
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
BRUTUS:
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
BRUTUS:
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
BRUTUS:
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
BRUTUS:
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
BRUTUS:
With variable complexions, all agreeing
BRUTUS:
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
BRUTUS:
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
BRUTUS:
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
BRUTUS:
Commit the war of white and damask in
BRUTUS:
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
BRUTUS:
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
BRUTUS:
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
BRUTUS:
Were slily crept into his human powers
BRUTUS:
And gave him graceful posture.
SICINIUS:
On the sudden,
SICINIUS:
I warrant him consul.
BRUTUS:
Then our office may,
BRUTUS:
During his power, go sleep.
SICINIUS:
He cannot temperately transport his honours
SICINIUS:
From where he should begin and end, but will
SICINIUS:
Lose those he hath won.
BRUTUS:
In that there's comfort.
SICINIUS:
Doubt not
SICINIUS:
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
SICINIUS:
Upon their ancient malice will forget
SICINIUS:
With the least cause these his new honours, which
SICINIUS:
That he will give them make I as little question
SICINIUS:
As he is proud to do't.
BRUTUS:
I heard him swear,
BRUTUS:
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
BRUTUS:
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
BRUTUS:
The napless vesture of humility,
BRUTUS:
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
BRUTUS:
To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
SICINIUS:
'Tis right.
BRUTUS:
It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
BRUTUS:
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
BRUTUS:
And the desire of the nobles.
SICINIUS:
I wish no better
SICINIUS:
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
SICINIUS:
In execution.
BRUTUS:
'Tis most like he will.
SICINIUS:
It shall be to him then as our good wills,
SICINIUS:
A sure destruction.
BRUTUS:
So it must fall out
BRUTUS:
To him or our authorities. For an end,
BRUTUS:
We must suggest the people in what hatred
BRUTUS:
He still hath held them, that to's power he would
BRUTUS:
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
BRUTUS:
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
BRUTUS:
In human action and capacity,
BRUTUS:
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
BRUTUS:
Than camels in the war, who have their provand
BRUTUS:
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
BRUTUS:
For sinking under them.
SICINIUS:
This, as you say, suggested
SICINIUS:
At some time when his soaring insolence
SICINIUS:
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
SICINIUS:
If he be put upon 't, and that's as easy
SICINIUS:
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
SICINIUS:
To kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze
SICINIUS:
Shall darken him for ever.
SICINIUS:
Enter a Messenger
BRUTUS:
What's the matter?
Messenger:
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
Messenger:
That Marcius shall be consul
Messenger:
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
Messenger:
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
Messenger:
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Messenger:
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
Messenger:
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
Messenger:
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
Messenger:
I never saw the like.
BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol,
BRUTUS:
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
BRUTUS:
But hearts for the event.
SICINIUS:
Have with you.
SICINIUS:
Exeunt
SICINIUS:
SCENE II. The same. The Capitol.
SICINIUS:
Enter two Officers, to lay cushions
First Officer:
Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
First Officer:
for consulships?
Second Officer:
Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
Second Officer:
Coriolanus will carry it.
First Officer:
That's a brave fellow, but he's vengeance proud, and
First Officer:
loves not the common people.
Second Officer:
Faith, there had been many great men that have
Second Officer:
flattered the people, who ne'er loved them, and there
Second Officer:
be many that they have loved, they know not
Second Officer:
wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
Second Officer:
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
Second Officer:
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
Second Officer:
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
Second Officer:
disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets
Second Officer:
them plainly see't.
First Officer:
If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
First Officer:
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
First Officer:
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
First Officer:
devotion than can render it him, and leaves
First Officer:
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
First Officer:
opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
First Officer:
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
First Officer:
dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Second Officer:
He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
Second Officer:
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
Second Officer:
having been supple and courteous to the people,
Second Officer:
bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
Second Officer:
an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
Second Officer:
planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
Second Officer:
in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
Second Officer:
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
Second Officer:
ingrateful injury, to report otherwise, were a
Second Officer:
malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
Second Officer:
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
First Officer:
No more of him, he is a worthy man: make way, they
First Officer:
are coming.
First Officer:
A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS  the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,  SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their  places, the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS stands
MENENIUS:
Having determined of the Volsces and
MENENIUS:
To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
MENENIUS:
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
MENENIUS:
To gratify his noble service that
MENENIUS:
Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
MENENIUS:
please you,
MENENIUS:
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
MENENIUS:
The present consul, and last general
MENENIUS:
In our well-found successes, to report
MENENIUS:
A little of that worthy work perform'd
MENENIUS:
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
MENENIUS:
We met here both to thank and to remember
MENENIUS:
With honours like himself.
First Senator:
Speak, good Cominius
First Senator:
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
First Senator:
Rather our state's defective for requital
First Senator:
Than we to stretch it out.
First Senator:
To the Tribunes
First Senator:
Masters o' the people,
First Senator:
We do request your kindest ears, and after,
First Senator:
Your loving motion toward the common body,
First Senator:
To yield what passes here.
SICINIUS:
We are convented
SICINIUS:
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
SICINIUS:
Inclinable to honour and advance
SICINIUS:
The theme of our assembly.
BRUTUS:
Which the rather
BRUTUS:
We shall be blest to do, if he remember
BRUTUS:
A kinder value of the people than
BRUTUS:
He hath hereto prized them at.
MENENIUS:
That's off, that's off,
MENENIUS:
I would you rather had been silent. Please you
MENENIUS:
To hear Cominius speak?
BRUTUS:
Most willingly,
BRUTUS:
But yet my caution was more pertinent
BRUTUS:
Than the rebuke you give it.
MENENIUS:
He loves your people
MENENIUS:
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
MENENIUS:
Worthy Cominius, speak.
MENENIUS:
CORIOLANUS offers to go away
MENENIUS:
Nay, keep your place.
First Senator:
Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear
First Senator:
What you have nobly done.
CORIOLANUS:
Your horror's pardon
CORIOLANUS:
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
CORIOLANUS:
Than hear say how I got them.
BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
BRUTUS:
My words disbench'd you not.
CORIOLANUS:
No, sir: yet oft,
CORIOLANUS:
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
CORIOLANUS:
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
CORIOLANUS:
your people,
CORIOLANUS:
I love them as they weigh.
MENENIUS:
Pray now, sit down.
CORIOLANUS:
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
CORIOLANUS:
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
CORIOLANUS:
To hear my nothings monster'd.
CORIOLANUS:
Exit
MENENIUS:
Masters of the people,
MENENIUS:
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
MENENIUS:
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
MENENIUS:
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
MENENIUS:
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
COMINIUS:
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
COMINIUS:
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
COMINIUS:
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
COMINIUS:
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
COMINIUS:
The man I speak of cannot in the world
COMINIUS:
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
COMINIUS:
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
COMINIUS:
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
COMINIUS:
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
COMINIUS:
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
COMINIUS:
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
COMINIUS:
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
COMINIUS:
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
COMINIUS:
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
COMINIUS:
When he might act the woman in the scene,
COMINIUS:
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
COMINIUS:
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
COMINIUS:
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
COMINIUS:
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
COMINIUS:
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
COMINIUS:
Before and in Corioli, let me say,
COMINIUS:
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers,
COMINIUS:
And by his rare example made the coward
COMINIUS:
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
COMINIUS:
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
COMINIUS:
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
COMINIUS:
Where it did mark, it took, from face to foot
COMINIUS:
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
COMINIUS:
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
COMINIUS:
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
COMINIUS:
With shunless destiny, aidless came off,
COMINIUS:
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
COMINIUS:
Corioli like a planet: now all's his
COMINIUS:
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
COMINIUS:
His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit
COMINIUS:
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
COMINIUS:
And to the battle came he, where he did
COMINIUS:
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
COMINIUS:
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
COMINIUS:
Both field and city ours, he never stood
COMINIUS:
To ease his breast with panting.
MENENIUS:
Worthy man!
First Senator:
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
First Senator:
Which we devise him.
COMINIUS:
Our spoils he kick'd at,
COMINIUS:
And look'd upon things precious as they were
COMINIUS:
The common muck of the world: he covets less
COMINIUS:
Than misery itself would give, rewards
COMINIUS:
His deeds with doing them, and is content
COMINIUS:
To spend the time to end it.
MENENIUS:
He's right noble
MENENIUS:
Let him be call'd for.
First Senator:
Call Coriolanus.
Officer:
He doth appear.
Officer:
Re-enter CORIOLANUS
MENENIUS:
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
MENENIUS:
To make thee consul.
CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them still
CORIOLANUS:
My life and services.
MENENIUS:
It then remains
MENENIUS:
That you do speak to the people.
CORIOLANUS:
I do beseech you,
CORIOLANUS:
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
CORIOLANUS:
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
CORIOLANUS:
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
CORIOLANUS:
That I may pass this doing.
SICINIUS:
Sir, the people
SICINIUS:
Must have their voices, neither will they bate
SICINIUS:
One jot of ceremony.
MENENIUS:
Put them not to't
MENENIUS:
Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
MENENIUS:
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
MENENIUS:
Your honour with your form.
CORIOLANUS:
It is apart
CORIOLANUS:
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
CORIOLANUS:
Be taken from the people.
BRUTUS:
Mark you that?
CORIOLANUS:
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus,
CORIOLANUS:
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
CORIOLANUS:
As if I had received them for the hire
CORIOLANUS:
Of their breath only!
MENENIUS:
Do not stand upon't.
MENENIUS:
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
MENENIUS:
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
MENENIUS:
Wish we all joy and honour.
Senators:
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
Senators:
Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
BRUTUS:
You see how he intends to use the people.
SICINIUS:
May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
SICINIUS:
As if he did contemn what he requested
SICINIUS:
Should be in them to give.
BRUTUS:
Come, we'll inform them
BRUTUS:
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
BRUTUS:
I know, they do attend us.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt
BRUTUS:
SCENE III. The same. The Forum.
BRUTUS:
Enter seven or eight Citizens
First Citizen:
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
Second Citizen:
We may, sir, if we will.
Third Citizen:
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
Third Citizen:
power that we have no power to do, for if he show us
Third Citizen:
his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
Third Citizen:
tongues into those wounds and speak for them, so, if
Third Citizen:
he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
Third Citizen:
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
Third Citizen:
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
Third Citizen:
were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
Third Citizen:
which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
Third Citizen:
monstrous members.
First Citizen:
And to make us no better thought of, a little help
First Citizen:
will serve, for once we stood up about the corn, he
First Citizen:
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
Third Citizen:
We have been called so of many, not that our heads
Third Citizen:
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
Third Citizen:
but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
Third Citizen:
truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
Third Citizen:
one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
Third Citizen:
and their consent of one direct way should be at
Third Citizen:
once to all the points o' the compass.
Second Citizen:
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
Second Citizen:
fly?
Third Citizen:
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
Third Citizen:
will,'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
Third Citizen:
if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.
Second Citizen:
Why that way?
Third Citizen:
To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
Third Citizen:
melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
Third Citizen:
for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.
Second Citizen:
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
Third Citizen:
Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
Third Citizen:
that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
Third Citizen:
say, if he would incline to the people, there was
Third Citizen:
never a worthier man.
Third Citizen:
Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility, with MENENIUS
Third Citizen:
Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
Third Citizen:
behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
Third Citizen:
come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
Third Citizen:
by threes. He's to make his requests by
Third Citizen:
particulars, wherein every one of us has a single
Third Citizen:
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
Third Citizen:
tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
Third Citizen:
you shall go by him.
All:
Content, content.
All:
Exeunt Citizens
MENENIUS:
O sir, you are not right: have you not known
MENENIUS:
The worthiest men have done't?
CORIOLANUS:
What must I say?
CORIOLANUS:
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
CORIOLANUS:
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
CORIOLANUS:
I got them in my country's service, when
CORIOLANUS:
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
CORIOLANUS:
From the noise of our own drums.'
MENENIUS:
O me, the gods!
MENENIUS:
You must not speak of that: you must desire them
MENENIUS:
To think upon you.
CORIOLANUS:
Think upon me! hang 'em!
CORIOLANUS:
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
CORIOLANUS:
Which our divines lose by 'em.
MENENIUS:
You'll mar all
MENENIUS:
I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
MENENIUS:
In wholesome manner.
MENENIUS:
Exit
CORIOLANUS:
Bid them wash their faces
CORIOLANUS:
And keep their teeth clean.
CORIOLANUS:
Re-enter two of the Citizens
CORIOLANUS:
So, here comes a brace.
CORIOLANUS:
Re-enter a third Citizen
CORIOLANUS:
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
Third Citizen:
We do, sir, tell us what hath brought you to't.
CORIOLANUS:
Mine own desert.
Second Citizen:
Your own desert!
CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but not mine own desire.
Third Citizen:
How not your own desire?
CORIOLANUS:
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
CORIOLANUS:
poor with begging.
Third Citizen:
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
Third Citizen:
gain by you.
CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
First Citizen:
The price is to ask it kindly.
CORIOLANUS:
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
CORIOLANUS:
show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
CORIOLANUS:
good voice, sir, what say you?
Second Citizen:
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
CORIOLANUS:
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
CORIOLANUS:
begged. I have your alms: adieu.
Third Citizen:
But this is something odd.
Second Citizen:
An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
Second Citizen:
Exeunt the three Citizens
Second Citizen:
Re-enter two other Citizens
CORIOLANUS:
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
CORIOLANUS:
voices that I may be consul, I have here the
CORIOLANUS:
customary gown.
Fourth Citizen:
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
Fourth Citizen:
have not deserved nobly.
CORIOLANUS:
Your enigma?
Fourth Citizen:
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
Fourth Citizen:
been a rod to her friends, you have not indeed loved
Fourth Citizen:
the common people.
CORIOLANUS:
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
CORIOLANUS:
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
CORIOLANUS:
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
CORIOLANUS:
estimation of them, 'tis a condition they account
CORIOLANUS:
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
CORIOLANUS:
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
CORIOLANUS:
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
CORIOLANUS:
counterfeitly, that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
CORIOLANUS:
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
CORIOLANUS:
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
CORIOLANUS:
I may be consul.
Fifth Citizen:
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give
Fifth Citizen:
you our voices heartily.
Fourth Citizen:
You have received many wounds for your country.
CORIOLANUS:
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
CORIOLANUS:
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Both Citizens:
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
Both Citizens:
Exeunt
CORIOLANUS:
Most sweet voices!
CORIOLANUS:
Better it is to die, better to starve,
CORIOLANUS:
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
CORIOLANUS:
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
CORIOLANUS:
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
CORIOLANUS:
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't
CORIOLANUS:
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
CORIOLANUS:
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
CORIOLANUS:
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
CORIOLANUS:
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
CORIOLANUS:
Let the high office and the honour go
CORIOLANUS:
To one that would do thus. I am half through,
CORIOLANUS:
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
CORIOLANUS:
Re-enter three Citizens more
CORIOLANUS:
Here come more voices.
CORIOLANUS:
Your voices: for your voices I have fought,
CORIOLANUS:
Watch'd for your voices, for Your voices bear
CORIOLANUS:
Of wounds two dozen odd, battles thrice six
CORIOLANUS:
I have seen and heard of, for your voices have
CORIOLANUS:
Done many things, some less, some more your voices
CORIOLANUS:
Indeed I would be consul.
Sixth Citizen:
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
Sixth Citizen:
man's voice.
Seventh Citizen:
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
Seventh Citizen:
and make him good friend to the people!
All Citizens:
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
All Citizens:
Exeunt
CORIOLANUS:
Worthy voices!
CORIOLANUS:
Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS
MENENIUS:
You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes
MENENIUS:
Endue you with the people's voice: remains
MENENIUS:
That, in the official marks invested, you
MENENIUS:
Anon do meet the senate.
CORIOLANUS:
Is this done?
SICINIUS:
The custom of request you have discharged
SICINIUS:
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
SICINIUS:
To meet anon, upon your approbation.
CORIOLANUS:
Where? at the senate-house?
SICINIUS:
There, Coriolanus.
CORIOLANUS:
May I change these garments?
SICINIUS:
You may, sir.
CORIOLANUS:
That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,
CORIOLANUS:
Repair to the senate-house.
MENENIUS:
I'll keep you company. Will you along?
BRUTUS:
We stay here for the people.
SICINIUS:
Fare you well.
SICINIUS:
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
SICINIUS:
He has it now, and by his looks methink
SICINIUS:
'Tis warm at 's heart.
BRUTUS:
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
BRUTUS:
will you dismiss the people?
BRUTUS:
Re-enter Citizens
SICINIUS:
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
First Citizen:
He has our voices, sir.
BRUTUS:
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Second Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
Second Citizen:
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
Third Citizen:
Certainly
Third Citizen:
He flouted us downright.
First Citizen:
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
Second Citizen:
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
Second Citizen:
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
Second Citizen:
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
SICINIUS:
Why, so he did, I am sure.
Citizens:
No, no, no man saw 'em.
Third Citizen:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
Third Citizen:
in private,
Third Citizen:
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
Third Citizen:
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
Third Citizen:
But by your voices, will not so permit me,
Third Citizen:
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Third Citizen:
Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you
Third Citizen:
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
Third Citizen:
your voices,
Third Citizen:
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
SICINIUS:
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
SICINIUS:
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
SICINIUS:
To yield your voices?
BRUTUS:
Could you not have told him
BRUTUS:
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
BRUTUS:
But was a petty servant to the state,
BRUTUS:
He was your enemy, ever spake against
BRUTUS:
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
BRUTUS:
I' the body of the weal, and now, arriving
BRUTUS:
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
BRUTUS:
If he should still malignantly remain
BRUTUS:
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
BRUTUS:
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
BRUTUS:
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
BRUTUS:
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
BRUTUS:
Would think upon you for your voices and
BRUTUS:
Translate his malice towards you into love,
BRUTUS:
Standing your friendly lord.
SICINIUS:
Thus to have said,
SICINIUS:
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
SICINIUS:
And tried his inclination, from him pluck'd
SICINIUS:
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
SICINIUS:
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
SICINIUS:
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
SICINIUS:
Which easily endures not article
SICINIUS:
Tying him to aught, so putting him to rage,
SICINIUS:
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
SICINIUS:
And pass'd him unelected.
BRUTUS:
Did you perceive
BRUTUS:
He did solicit you in free contempt
BRUTUS:
When he did need your loves, and do you think
BRUTUS:
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
BRUTUS:
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
BRUTUS:
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
BRUTUS:
Against the rectorship of judgment?
SICINIUS:
Have you
SICINIUS:
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
SICINIUS:
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
SICINIUS:
Your sued-for tongues?
Third Citizen:
He's not confirm'd, we may deny him yet.
Second Citizen:
And will deny him
Second Citizen:
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
First Citizen:
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
BRUTUS:
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
BRUTUS:
They have chose a consul that will from them take
BRUTUS:
Their liberties, make them of no more voice
BRUTUS:
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
BRUTUS:
As therefore kept to do so.
SICINIUS:
Let them assemble,
SICINIUS:
And on a safer judgment all revoke
SICINIUS:
Your ignorant election, enforce his pride,
SICINIUS:
And his old hate unto you, besides, forget not
SICINIUS:
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
SICINIUS:
How in his suit he scorn'd you, but your loves,
SICINIUS:
Thinking upon his services, took from you
SICINIUS:
The apprehension of his present portance,
SICINIUS:
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
SICINIUS:
After the inveterate hate he bears you.
BRUTUS:
Lay
BRUTUS:
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we laboured,
BRUTUS:
No impediment between, but that you must
BRUTUS:
Cast your election on him.
SICINIUS:
Say, you chose him
SICINIUS:
More after our commandment than as guided
SICINIUS:
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
SICINIUS:
Preoccupied with what you rather must do
SICINIUS:
Than what you should, made you against the grain
SICINIUS:
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
BRUTUS:
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
BRUTUS:
How youngly he began to serve his country,
BRUTUS:
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
BRUTUS:
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
BRUTUS:
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
BRUTUS:
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king,
BRUTUS:
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
BRUTUS:
That our beat water brought by conduits hither,
BRUTUS:
And  [Censorinus,]  nobly named so,
BRUTUS:
Twice being  [by the people chosen]  censor,
BRUTUS:
Was his great ancestor.
SICINIUS:
One thus descended,
SICINIUS:
That hath beside well in his person wrought
SICINIUS:
To be set high in place, we did commend
SICINIUS:
To your remembrances: but you have found,
SICINIUS:
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
SICINIUS:
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
SICINIUS:
Your sudden approbation.
BRUTUS:
Say, you ne'er had done't--
BRUTUS:
Harp on that still--but by our putting on,
BRUTUS:
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
BRUTUS:
Repair to the Capitol.
All:
We will so: almost all
All:
Repent in their election.
All:
Exeunt Citizens
BRUTUS:
Let them go on,
BRUTUS:
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
BRUTUS:
Than stay, past doubt, for greater
BRUTUS:
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
BRUTUS:
With their refusal, both observe and answer
BRUTUS:
The vantage of his anger.
SICINIUS:
To the Capitol, come
SICINIUS:
We will be there before the stream o' the people,
SICINIUS:
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
SICINIUS:
Which we have goaded onward.
SICINIUS:
Exeunt
SICINIUS:
ACT III
SICINIUS:
SCENE I. Rome. A street.
SICINIUS:
Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators
CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
LARTIUS:
He had, my lord, and that it was which caused
LARTIUS:
Our swifter composition.
CORIOLANUS:
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
CORIOLANUS:
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
CORIOLANUS:
Upon's again.
COMINIUS:
They are worn, lord consul, so,
COMINIUS:
That we shall hardly in our ages see
COMINIUS:
Their banners wave again.
CORIOLANUS:
Saw you Aufidius?
LARTIUS:
On safe-guard he  came to me, and did curse
LARTIUS:
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
LARTIUS:
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?
LARTIUS:
He did, my lord.
CORIOLANUS:
How? what?
LARTIUS:
How often he had met you, sword to sword,
LARTIUS:
That of all things upon the earth he hated
LARTIUS:
Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
LARTIUS:
To hopeless restitution, so he might
LARTIUS:
Be call'd your vanquisher.
CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?
LARTIUS:
At Antium.
CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
CORIOLANUS:
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
CORIOLANUS:
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
CORIOLANUS:
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
CORIOLANUS:
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them,
CORIOLANUS:
For they do prank them in authority,
CORIOLANUS:
Against all noble sufferance.
SICINIUS:
Pass no further.
CORIOLANUS:
Ha! what is that?
BRUTUS:
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
CORIOLANUS:
What makes this change?
MENENIUS:
The matter?
COMINIUS:
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
BRUTUS:
Cominius, no.
CORIOLANUS:
Have I had children's voices?
First Senator:
Tribunes, give way, he shall to the market-place.
BRUTUS:
The people are incensed against him.
SICINIUS:
Stop,
SICINIUS:
Or all will fall in broil.
CORIOLANUS:
Are these your herd?
CORIOLANUS:
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
CORIOLANUS:
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
CORIOLANUS:
your offices?
CORIOLANUS:
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
CORIOLANUS:
Have you not set them on?
MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.
CORIOLANUS:
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
CORIOLANUS:
To curb the will of the nobility
CORIOLANUS:
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
CORIOLANUS:
Nor ever will be ruled.
BRUTUS:
Call't not a plot
BRUTUS:
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
BRUTUS:
When corn was given them gratis, you repined,
BRUTUS:
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
BRUTUS:
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
CORIOLANUS:
Why, this was known before.
BRUTUS:
Not to them all.
CORIOLANUS:
Have you inform'd them sithence?
BRUTUS:
How! I inform them!
CORIOLANUS:
You are like to do such business.
BRUTUS:
Not unlike,
BRUTUS:
Each way, to better yours.
CORIOLANUS:
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
CORIOLANUS:
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
CORIOLANUS:
Your fellow tribune.
SICINIUS:
You show too much of that
SICINIUS:
For which the people stir: if you will pass
SICINIUS:
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
SICINIUS:
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
SICINIUS:
Or never be so noble as a consul,
SICINIUS:
Nor yoke with him for tribune.
MENENIUS:
Let's be calm.
COMINIUS:
The people are abused, set on. This paltering
COMINIUS:
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
COMINIUS:
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
COMINIUS:
I' the plain way of his merit.
CORIOLANUS:
Tell me of corn!
CORIOLANUS:
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.
First Senator:
Not in this heat, sir, now.
CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
CORIOLANUS:
I crave their pardons
CORIOLANUS:
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
CORIOLANUS:
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
CORIOLANUS:
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
CORIOLANUS:
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
CORIOLANUS:
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
CORIOLANUS:
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
CORIOLANUS:
and scatter'd,
CORIOLANUS:
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
CORIOLANUS:
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
CORIOLANUS:
Which they have given to beggars.
MENENIUS:
Well, no more.
First Senator:
No more words, we beseech you.
CORIOLANUS:
How! no more!
CORIOLANUS:
As for my country I have shed my blood,
CORIOLANUS:
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
CORIOLANUS:
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
CORIOLANUS:
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
CORIOLANUS:
The very way to catch them.
BRUTUS:
You speak o' the people,
BRUTUS:
As if you were a god to punish, not
BRUTUS:
A man of their infirmity.
SICINIUS:
'Twere well
SICINIUS:
We let the people know't.
MENENIUS:
What, what? his choler?
CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
CORIOLANUS:
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
CORIOLANUS:
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
SICINIUS:
It is a mind
SICINIUS:
That shall remain a poison where it is,
SICINIUS:
Not poison any further.
CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain!
CORIOLANUS:
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
CORIOLANUS:
His absolute 'shall'?
COMINIUS:
'Twas from the canon.
CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
CORIOLANUS:
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
CORIOLANUS:
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
CORIOLANUS:
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
CORIOLANUS:
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
CORIOLANUS:
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
CORIOLANUS:
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
CORIOLANUS:
And make your channel his? If he have power
CORIOLANUS:
Then vail your ignorance, if none, awake
CORIOLANUS:
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
CORIOLANUS:
Be not as common fools, if you are not,
CORIOLANUS:
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
CORIOLANUS:
If they be senators: and they are no less,
CORIOLANUS:
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
CORIOLANUS:
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
CORIOLANUS:
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
CORIOLANUS:
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
CORIOLANUS:
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
CORIOLANUS:
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
CORIOLANUS:
To know, when two authorities are up,
CORIOLANUS:
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
CORIOLANUS:
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
CORIOLANUS:
The one by the other.
COMINIUS:
Well, on to the market-place.
CORIOLANUS:
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
CORIOLANUS:
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
CORIOLANUS:
Sometime in Greece,--
MENENIUS:
Well, well, no more of that.
CORIOLANUS:
Though there the people had more absolute power,
CORIOLANUS:
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
CORIOLANUS:
The ruin of the state.
BRUTUS:
Why, shall the people give
BRUTUS:
One that speaks thus their voice?
CORIOLANUS:
I'll give my reasons,
CORIOLANUS:
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
CORIOLANUS:
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
CORIOLANUS:
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
CORIOLANUS:
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
CORIOLANUS:
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
CORIOLANUS:
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
CORIOLANUS:
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
CORIOLANUS:
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
CORIOLANUS:
Which they have often made against the senate,
CORIOLANUS:
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
CORIOLANUS:
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
CORIOLANUS:
How shall this bisson multitude digest
CORIOLANUS:
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
CORIOLANUS:
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it,
CORIOLANUS:
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
CORIOLANUS:
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
CORIOLANUS:
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
CORIOLANUS:
Call our cares fears, which will in time
CORIOLANUS:
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
CORIOLANUS:
The crows to peck the eagles.
MENENIUS:
Come, enough.
BRUTUS:
Enough, with over-measure.
CORIOLANUS:
No, take more
CORIOLANUS:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
CORIOLANUS:
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
CORIOLANUS:
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
CORIOLANUS:
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
CORIOLANUS:
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
CORIOLANUS:
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
CORIOLANUS:
Real necessities, and give way the while
CORIOLANUS:
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
CORIOLANUS:
it follows,
CORIOLANUS:
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
CORIOLANUS:
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
CORIOLANUS:
That love the fundamental part of state
CORIOLANUS:
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
CORIOLANUS:
A noble life before a long, and wish
CORIOLANUS:
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
CORIOLANUS:
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
CORIOLANUS:
The multitudinous tongue, let them not lick
CORIOLANUS:
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
CORIOLANUS:
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
CORIOLANUS:
Of that integrity which should become't,
CORIOLANUS:
Not having the power to do the good it would,
CORIOLANUS:
For the in which doth control't.
BRUTUS:
Has said enough.
SICINIUS:
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
SICINIUS:
As traitors do.
CORIOLANUS:
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
CORIOLANUS:
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
CORIOLANUS:
On whom depending, their obedience fails
CORIOLANUS:
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
CORIOLANUS:
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
CORIOLANUS:
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
CORIOLANUS:
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
CORIOLANUS:
And throw their power i' the dust.
BRUTUS:
Manifest treason!
SICINIUS:
This a consul? no.
BRUTUS:
The aediles, ho!
BRUTUS:
Enter an AEdile
BRUTUS:
Let him be apprehended.
SICINIUS:
Go, call the people
SICINIUS:
Exit AEdile
SICINIUS:
in whose name myself
SICINIUS:
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
SICINIUS:
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
SICINIUS:
And follow to thine answer.
CORIOLANUS:
Hence, old goat!
CORIOLANUS:
Senators,  and C	We'll surety him.
COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.
CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
CORIOLANUS:
Out of thy garments.
SICINIUS:
Help, ye citizens!
SICINIUS:
Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdiles
MENENIUS:
On both sides more respect.
SICINIUS:
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
BRUTUS:
Seize him, AEdiles!
Citizens:
Down with him! down with him!
Citizens:
Senators,  and C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!
Citizens:
They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying
Citizens:
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
Citizens:
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
Citizens:
'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'
MENENIUS:
What is about to be? I am out of breath,
MENENIUS:
Confusion's near, I cannot speak. You, tribunes
MENENIUS:
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
MENENIUS:
Speak, good Sicinius.
SICINIUS:
Hear me, people, peace!
Citizens:
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
SICINIUS:
You are at point to lose your liberties
SICINIUS:
Marcius would have all from you, Marcius,
SICINIUS:
Whom late you have named for consul.
MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!
MENENIUS:
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
First Senator:
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
SICINIUS:
What is the city but the people?
Citizens:
True,
Citizens:
The people are the city.
BRUTUS:
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
BRUTUS:
The people's magistrates.
Citizens:
You so remain.
MENENIUS:
And so are like to do.
COMINIUS:
That is the way to lay the city flat,
COMINIUS:
To bring the roof to the foundation,
COMINIUS:
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
COMINIUS:
In heaps and piles of ruin.
SICINIUS:
This deserves death.
BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authority,
BRUTUS:
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
BRUTUS:
Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
BRUTUS:
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
BRUTUS:
Of present death.
SICINIUS:
Therefore lay hold of him,
SICINIUS:
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
SICINIUS:
Into destruction cast him.
BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!
Citizens:
Yield, Marcius, yield!
MENENIUS:
Hear me one word,
MENENIUS:
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
AEdile:
Peace, peace!
MENENIUS:
[To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem, truly your
MENENIUS:
country's friend,
MENENIUS:
And temperately proceed to what you would
MENENIUS:
Thus violently redress.
BRUTUS:
Sir, those cold ways,
BRUTUS:
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
BRUTUS:
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
BRUTUS:
And bear him to the rock.
CORIOLANUS:
No, I'll die here.
CORIOLANUS:
Drawing his sword
CORIOLANUS:
There's some among you have beheld me fighting
CORIOLANUS:
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
MENENIUS:
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
BRUTUS:
Lay hands upon him.
COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
COMINIUS:
You that be noble, help him, young and old!
Citizens:
Down with him, down with him!
Citizens:
In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the People, are beat in
MENENIUS:
Go, get you to your house, be gone, away!
MENENIUS:
All will be naught else.
Second Senator:
Get you gone.
COMINIUS:
Stand fast,
COMINIUS:
We have as many friends as enemies.
MENENIUS:
Sham it be put to that?
First Senator:
The gods forbid!
First Senator:
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house,
First Senator:
Leave us to cure this cause.
MENENIUS:
For 'tis a sore upon us,
MENENIUS:
You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
COMINIUS:
Come, sir, along with us.
CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians--as they are,
CORIOLANUS:
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
CORIOLANUS:
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
MENENIUS:
Be gone,
MENENIUS:
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue,
MENENIUS:
One time will owe another.
CORIOLANUS:
On fair ground
CORIOLANUS:
I could beat forty of them.
COMINIUS:
I could myself
COMINIUS:
Take up a brace o' the best of them, yea, the
COMINIUS:
two tribunes
COMINIUS:
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,
COMINIUS:
And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
COMINIUS:
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
COMINIUS:
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
COMINIUS:
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
COMINIUS:
What they are used to bear.
MENENIUS:
Pray you, be gone
MENENIUS:
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
MENENIUS:
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
MENENIUS:
With cloth of any colour.
COMINIUS:
Nay, come away.
COMINIUS:
Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others
A Patrician:
This man has marr'd his fortune.
MENENIUS:
His nature is too noble for the world
MENENIUS:
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
MENENIUS:
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth
MENENIUS:
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,
MENENIUS:
And, being angry, does forget that ever
MENENIUS:
He heard the name of death.
MENENIUS:
A noise within
MENENIUS:
Here's goodly work!
Second Patrician:
I would they were abed!
MENENIUS:
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
MENENIUS:
Could he not speak 'em fair?
MENENIUS:
Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble
SICINIUS:
Where is this viper
SICINIUS:
That would depopulate the city and
SICINIUS:
Be every man himself?
MENENIUS:
You worthy tribunes,--
SICINIUS:
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
SICINIUS:
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
SICINIUS:
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
SICINIUS:
Than the severity of the public power
SICINIUS:
Which he so sets at nought.
First Citizen:
He shall well know
First Citizen:
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
First Citizen:
And we their hands.
Citizens:
He shall, sure on't.
MENENIUS:
Sir, sir,--
SICINIUS:
Peace!
MENENIUS:
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
MENENIUS:
With modest warrant.
SICINIUS:
Sir, how comes't that you
SICINIUS:
Have holp to make this rescue?
MENENIUS:
Hear me speak
MENENIUS:
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
MENENIUS:
So can I name his faults,--
SICINIUS:
Consul! what consul?
MENENIUS:
The consul Coriolanus.
BRUTUS:
He consul!
Citizens:
No, no, no, no, no.
MENENIUS:
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
MENENIUS:
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two,
MENENIUS:
The which shall turn you to no further harm
MENENIUS:
Than so much loss of time.
SICINIUS:
Speak briefly then,
SICINIUS:
For we are peremptory to dispatch
SICINIUS:
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
SICINIUS:
Were but one danger, and to keep him here
SICINIUS:
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
SICINIUS:
He dies to-night.
MENENIUS:
Now the good gods forbid
MENENIUS:
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
MENENIUS:
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
MENENIUS:
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
MENENIUS:
Should now eat up her own!
SICINIUS:
He's a disease that must be cut away.
MENENIUS:
O, he's a limb that has but a disease,
MENENIUS:
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
MENENIUS:
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
MENENIUS:
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
MENENIUS:
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
MENENIUS:
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country,
MENENIUS:
And what is left, to lose it by his country,
MENENIUS:
Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
MENENIUS:
A brand to the end o' the world.
SICINIUS:
This is clean kam.
BRUTUS:
Merely awry: when he did love his country,
BRUTUS:
It honour'd him.
MENENIUS:
The service of the foot
MENENIUS:
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
MENENIUS:
For what before it was.
BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.
BRUTUS:
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence
BRUTUS:
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
BRUTUS:
Spread further.
MENENIUS:
One word more, one word.
MENENIUS:
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
MENENIUS:
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
MENENIUS:
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process,
MENENIUS:
Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
MENENIUS:
And sack great Rome with Romans.
BRUTUS:
If it were so,--
SICINIUS:
What do ye talk?
SICINIUS:
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
SICINIUS:
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
MENENIUS:
Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
MENENIUS:
Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
MENENIUS:
In bolted language, meal and bran together
MENENIUS:
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
MENENIUS:
I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
MENENIUS:
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
MENENIUS:
In peace, to his utmost peril.
First Senator:
Noble tribunes,
First Senator:
It is the humane way: the other course
First Senator:
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
First Senator:
Unknown to the beginning.
SICINIUS:
Noble Menenius,
SICINIUS:
Be you then as the people's officer.
SICINIUS:
Masters, lay down your weapons.
BRUTUS:
Go not home.
SICINIUS:
Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there
SICINIUS:
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
SICINIUS:
In our first way.
MENENIUS:
I'll bring him to you.
MENENIUS:
To the Senators
MENENIUS:
Let me desire your company: he must come,
MENENIUS:
Or what is worst will follow.
First Senator:
Pray you, let's to him.
First Senator:
Exeunt
First Senator:
SCENE II. A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.
First Senator:
Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians
CORIOLANUS:
Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
CORIOLANUS:
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
CORIOLANUS:
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
CORIOLANUS:
That the precipitation might down stretch
CORIOLANUS:
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
CORIOLANUS:
Be thus to them.
A Patrician:
You do the nobler.
CORIOLANUS:
I muse my mother
CORIOLANUS:
Does not approve me further, who was wont
CORIOLANUS:
To call them woollen vassals, things created
CORIOLANUS:
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
CORIOLANUS:
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
CORIOLANUS:
When one but of my ordinance stood up
CORIOLANUS:
To speak of peace or war.
CORIOLANUS:
Enter VOLUMNIA
CORIOLANUS:
I talk of you
CORIOLANUS:
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
CORIOLANUS:
False to my nature? Rather say I play
CORIOLANUS:
The man I am.
VOLUMNIA:
O, sir, sir, sir,
VOLUMNIA:
I would have had you put your power well on,
VOLUMNIA:
Before you had worn it out.
CORIOLANUS:
Let go.
VOLUMNIA:
You might have been enough the man you are,
VOLUMNIA:
With striving less to be so, lesser had been
VOLUMNIA:
The thwartings of your dispositions, if
VOLUMNIA:
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
VOLUMNIA:
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
CORIOLANUS:
Let them hang.
A Patrician:
Ay, and burn too.
A Patrician:
Enter MENENIUS and Senators
MENENIUS:
Come, come, you have been too rough, something
MENENIUS:
too rough,
MENENIUS:
You must return and mend it.
First Senator:
There's no remedy,
First Senator:
Unless, by not so doing, our good city
First Senator:
Cleave in the midst, and perish.
VOLUMNIA:
Pray, be counsell'd
VOLUMNIA:
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
VOLUMNIA:
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
VOLUMNIA:
To better vantage.
MENENIUS:
Well said, noble woman?
MENENIUS:
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
MENENIUS:
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
MENENIUS:
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
MENENIUS:
Which I can scarcely bear.
CORIOLANUS:
What must I do?
MENENIUS:
Return to the tribunes.
CORIOLANUS:
Well, what then? what then?
MENENIUS:
Repent what you have spoke.
CORIOLANUS:
For them! I cannot do it to the gods,
CORIOLANUS:
Must I then do't to them?
VOLUMNIA:
You are too absolute,
VOLUMNIA:
Though therein you can never be too noble,
VOLUMNIA:
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
VOLUMNIA:
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
VOLUMNIA:
I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
VOLUMNIA:
In peace what each of them by the other lose,
VOLUMNIA:
That they combine not there.
CORIOLANUS:
Tush, tush!
MENENIUS:
A good demand.
VOLUMNIA:
If it be honour in your wars to seem
VOLUMNIA:
The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
VOLUMNIA:
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
VOLUMNIA:
That it shall hold companionship in peace
VOLUMNIA:
With honour, as in war, since that to both
VOLUMNIA:
It stands in like request?
CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this?
VOLUMNIA:
Because that now it lies you on to speak
VOLUMNIA:
To the people, not by your own instruction,
VOLUMNIA:
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
VOLUMNIA:
But with such words that are but rooted in
VOLUMNIA:
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
VOLUMNIA:
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
VOLUMNIA:
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
VOLUMNIA:
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
VOLUMNIA:
Which else would put you to your fortune and
VOLUMNIA:
The hazard of much blood.
VOLUMNIA:
I would dissemble with my nature where
VOLUMNIA:
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
VOLUMNIA:
I should do so in honour: I am in this,
VOLUMNIA:
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles,
VOLUMNIA:
And you will rather show our general louts
VOLUMNIA:
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
VOLUMNIA:
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
VOLUMNIA:
Of what that want might ruin.
MENENIUS:
Noble lady!
MENENIUS:
Come, go with us, speak fair: you may salve so,
MENENIUS:
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
MENENIUS:
Of what is past.
VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, my son,
VOLUMNIA:
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand,
VOLUMNIA:
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
VOLUMNIA:
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
VOLUMNIA:
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
VOLUMNIA:
More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
VOLUMNIA:
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
VOLUMNIA:
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
VOLUMNIA:
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
VOLUMNIA:
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
VOLUMNIA:
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
VOLUMNIA:
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
VOLUMNIA:
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
VOLUMNIA:
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
VOLUMNIA:
As thou hast power and person.
MENENIUS:
This but done,
MENENIUS:
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours,
MENENIUS:
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
MENENIUS:
As words to little purpose.
VOLUMNIA:
Prithee now,
VOLUMNIA:
Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
VOLUMNIA:
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
VOLUMNIA:
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
VOLUMNIA:
Enter COMINIUS
COMINIUS:
I have been i' the market-place, and, sir,'tis fit
COMINIUS:
You make strong party, or defend yourself
COMINIUS:
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
MENENIUS:
Only fair speech.
COMINIUS:
I think 'twill serve, if he
COMINIUS:
Can thereto frame his spirit.
VOLUMNIA:
He must, and will
VOLUMNIA:
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
CORIOLANUS:
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
CORIOLANUS:
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
CORIOLANUS:
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't
CORIOLANUS:
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
CORIOLANUS:
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
CORIOLANUS:
And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
CORIOLANUS:
You have put me now to such a part which never
CORIOLANUS:
I shall discharge to the life.
COMINIUS:
Come, come, we'll prompt you.
VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
VOLUMNIA:
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
VOLUMNIA:
To have my praise for this, perform a part
VOLUMNIA:
Thou hast not done before.
CORIOLANUS:
Well, I must do't
CORIOLANUS:
Away, my disposition, and possess me
CORIOLANUS:
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
CORIOLANUS:
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
CORIOLANUS:
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
CORIOLANUS:
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
CORIOLANUS:
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
CORIOLANUS:
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
CORIOLANUS:
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
CORIOLANUS:
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
CORIOLANUS:
That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
CORIOLANUS:
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
CORIOLANUS:
And by my body's action teach my mind
CORIOLANUS:
A most inherent baseness.
VOLUMNIA:
At thy choice, then
VOLUMNIA:
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
VOLUMNIA:
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin, let
VOLUMNIA:
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
VOLUMNIA:
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
VOLUMNIA:
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
VOLUMNIA:
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
VOLUMNIA:
But owe thy pride thyself.
CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be content
CORIOLANUS:
Mother, I am going to the market-place,
CORIOLANUS:
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
CORIOLANUS:
Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
CORIOLANUS:
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going
CORIOLANUS:
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,
CORIOLANUS:
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
CORIOLANUS:
I' the way of flattery further.
VOLUMNIA:
Do your will.
VOLUMNIA:
Exit
COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
COMINIUS:
To answer mildly, for they are prepared
COMINIUS:
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
COMINIUS:
Than are upon you yet.
CORIOLANUS:
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go
CORIOLANUS:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
CORIOLANUS:
Will answer in mine honour.
MENENIUS:
Ay, but mildly.
CORIOLANUS:
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
CORIOLANUS:
Exeunt
CORIOLANUS:
SCENE III. The same. The Forum.
CORIOLANUS:
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
BRUTUS:
In this point charge him home, that he affects
BRUTUS:
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
BRUTUS:
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
BRUTUS:
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
BRUTUS:
Was ne'er distributed.
BRUTUS:
Enter an AEdile
BRUTUS:
What, will he come?
AEdile:
He's coming.
BRUTUS:
How accompanied?
AEdile:
With old Menenius, and those senators
AEdile:
That always favour'd him.
SICINIUS:
Have you a catalogue
SICINIUS:
Of all the voices that we have procured
SICINIUS:
Set down by the poll?
AEdile:
I have, 'tis ready.
SICINIUS:
Have you collected them by tribes?
AEdile:
I have.
SICINIUS:
Assemble presently the people hither,
SICINIUS:
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
SICINIUS:
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
SICINIUS:
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
SICINIUS:
If I say fine, cry 'Fine,' if death, cry 'Death.'
SICINIUS:
Insisting on the old prerogative
SICINIUS:
And power i' the truth o' the cause.
AEdile:
I shall inform them.
BRUTUS:
And when such time they have begun to cry,
BRUTUS:
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
BRUTUS:
Enforce the present execution
BRUTUS:
Of what we chance to sentence.
AEdile:
Very well.
SICINIUS:
Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
SICINIUS:
When we shall hap to give 't them.
BRUTUS:
Go about it.
BRUTUS:
Exit AEdile
BRUTUS:
Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
BRUTUS:
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
BRUTUS:
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
BRUTUS:
Be rein'd again to temperance, then he speaks
BRUTUS:
What's in his heart, and that is there which looks
BRUTUS:
With us to break his neck.
SICINIUS:
Well, here he comes.
SICINIUS:
Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS, with Senators and Patricians
MENENIUS:
Calmly, I do beseech you.
CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
CORIOLANUS:
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
CORIOLANUS:
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
CORIOLANUS:
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
CORIOLANUS:
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
CORIOLANUS:
And not our streets with war!
First Senator:
Amen, amen.
MENENIUS:
A noble wish.
MENENIUS:
Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens
SICINIUS:
Draw near, ye people.
AEdile:
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!
CORIOLANUS:
First, hear me speak.
Both Tribunes:
Well, say. Peace, ho!
CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
CORIOLANUS:
Must all determine here?
SICINIUS:
I do demand,
SICINIUS:
If you submit you to the people's voices,
SICINIUS:
Allow their officers and are content
SICINIUS:
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
SICINIUS:
As shall be proved upon you?
CORIOLANUS:
I am content.
MENENIUS:
Lo, citizens, he says he is content
MENENIUS:
The warlike service he has done, consider, think
MENENIUS:
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
MENENIUS:
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with briers,
CORIOLANUS:
Scars to move laughter only.
MENENIUS:
Consider further,
MENENIUS:
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
MENENIUS:
You find him like a soldier: do not take
MENENIUS:
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
MENENIUS:
But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
MENENIUS:
Rather than envy you.
COMINIUS:
Well, well, no more.
CORIOLANUS:
What is the matter
CORIOLANUS:
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
CORIOLANUS:
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
CORIOLANUS:
You take it off again?
SICINIUS:
Answer to us.
CORIOLANUS:
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.
SICINIUS:
We charge you, that you have contrived to take
SICINIUS:
From Rome all season'd office and to wind
SICINIUS:
Yourself into a power tyrannical,
SICINIUS:
For which you are a traitor to the people.
CORIOLANUS:
How! traitor!
MENENIUS:
Nay, temperately, your promise.
CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
CORIOLANUS:
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
CORIOLANUS:
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
CORIOLANUS:
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
CORIOLANUS:
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
CORIOLANUS:
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
CORIOLANUS:
As I do pray the gods.
SICINIUS:
Mark you this, people?
Citizens:
To the rock, to the rock with him!
SICINIUS:
Peace!
SICINIUS:
We need not put new matter to his charge
SICINIUS:
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
SICINIUS:
Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
SICINIUS:
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
SICINIUS:
Those whose great power must try him, even this,
SICINIUS:
So criminal and in such capital kind,
SICINIUS:
Deserves the extremest death.
BRUTUS:
But since he hath
BRUTUS:
Served well for Rome,--
CORIOLANUS:
What do you prate of service?
BRUTUS:
I talk of that, that know it.
CORIOLANUS:
You?
MENENIUS:
Is this the promise that you made your mother?
COMINIUS:
Know, I pray you,--
CORIOLANUS:
I know no further
CORIOLANUS:
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
CORIOLANUS:
Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
CORIOLANUS:
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
CORIOLANUS:
Their mercy at the price of one fair word,
CORIOLANUS:
Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
CORIOLANUS:
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
SICINIUS:
For that he has,
SICINIUS:
As much as in him lies, from time to time
SICINIUS:
Envied against the people, seeking means
SICINIUS:
To pluck away their power, as now at last
SICINIUS:
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
SICINIUS:
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
SICINIUS:
That do distribute it, in the name o' the people
SICINIUS:
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
SICINIUS:
Even from this instant, banish him our city,
SICINIUS:
In peril of precipitation
SICINIUS:
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
SICINIUS:
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
SICINIUS:
I say it shall be so.
Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so, let him away
Citizens:
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
COMINIUS:
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--
SICINIUS:
He's sentenced, no more hearing.
COMINIUS:
Let me speak
COMINIUS:
I have been consul, and can show for Rome
COMINIUS:
Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
COMINIUS:
My country's good with a respect more tender,
COMINIUS:
More holy and profound, than mine own life,
COMINIUS:
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
COMINIUS:
And treasure of my loins, then if I would
COMINIUS:
Speak that,--
SICINIUS:
We know your drift: speak what?
BRUTUS:
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
BRUTUS:
As enemy to the people and his country
BRUTUS:
It shall be so.
Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so.
CORIOLANUS:
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
CORIOLANUS:
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
CORIOLANUS:
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
CORIOLANUS:
That do corrupt my air, I banish you,
CORIOLANUS:
And here remain with your uncertainty!
CORIOLANUS:
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
CORIOLANUS:
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
CORIOLANUS:
Fan you into despair! Have the power still
CORIOLANUS:
To banish your defenders, till at length
CORIOLANUS:
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
CORIOLANUS:
Making not reservation of yourselves,
CORIOLANUS:
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
CORIOLANUS:
Abated captives to some nation
CORIOLANUS:
That won you without blows! Despising,
CORIOLANUS:
For you, the city, thus I turn my back
CORIOLANUS:
There is a world elsewhere.
CORIOLANUS:
Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, MENENIUS, Senators, and Patricians
AEdile:
The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
Citizens:
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
Citizens:
Shouting, and throwing up their caps
SICINIUS:
Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
SICINIUS:
As he hath followed you, with all despite,
SICINIUS:
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
SICINIUS:
Attend us through the city.
Citizens:
Come, come, let's see him out at gates, come.
Citizens:
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.
Citizens:
Exeunt
Citizens:
ACT IV
Citizens:
SCENE I. Rome. Before a gate of the city.
Citizens:
Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS, with the young Nobility of Rome
CORIOLANUS:
Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
CORIOLANUS:
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
CORIOLANUS:
Where is your ancient courage? you were used
CORIOLANUS:
To say extremity was the trier of spirits,
CORIOLANUS:
That common chances common men could bear,
CORIOLANUS:
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
CORIOLANUS:
Show'd mastership in floating, fortune's blows,
CORIOLANUS:
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
CORIOLANUS:
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
CORIOLANUS:
With precepts that would make invincible
CORIOLANUS:
The heart that conn'd them.
VIRGILIA:
O heavens! O heavens!
CORIOLANUS:
Nay! prithee, woman,--
VOLUMNIA:
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
VOLUMNIA:
And occupations perish!
CORIOLANUS:
What, what, what!
CORIOLANUS:
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
CORIOLANUS:
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
CORIOLANUS:
If you had been the wife of Hercules,
CORIOLANUS:
Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
CORIOLANUS:
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
CORIOLANUS:
Droop not, adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother
CORIOLANUS:
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
CORIOLANUS:
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
CORIOLANUS:
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
CORIOLANUS:
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
CORIOLANUS:
Heart-hardening spectacles, tell these sad women
CORIOLANUS:
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
CORIOLANUS:
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
CORIOLANUS:
My hazards still have been your solace: and
CORIOLANUS:
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
CORIOLANUS:
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
CORIOLANUS:
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
CORIOLANUS:
Will or exceed the common or be caught
CORIOLANUS:
With cautelous baits and practise.
VOLUMNIA:
My first son.
VOLUMNIA:
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
VOLUMNIA:
With thee awhile: determine on some course,
VOLUMNIA:
More than a wild exposture to each chance
VOLUMNIA:
That starts i' the way before thee.
CORIOLANUS:
O the gods!
COMINIUS:
I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
COMINIUS:
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
COMINIUS:
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
COMINIUS:
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
COMINIUS:
O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
COMINIUS:
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
COMINIUS:
I' the absence of the needer.
CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye well
CORIOLANUS:
Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full
CORIOLANUS:
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
CORIOLANUS:
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
CORIOLANUS:
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
CORIOLANUS:
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
CORIOLANUS:
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
CORIOLANUS:
While I remain above the ground, you shall
CORIOLANUS:
Hear from me still, and never of me aught
CORIOLANUS:
But what is like me formerly.
MENENIUS:
That's worthily
MENENIUS:
As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
MENENIUS:
If I could shake off but one seven years
MENENIUS:
From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
MENENIUS:
I'ld with thee every foot.
CORIOLANUS:
Give me thy hand: Come.
CORIOLANUS:
Exeunt
CORIOLANUS:
SCENE II. The same. A  street near the gate.
CORIOLANUS:
Enter SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and an AEdile
SICINIUS:
Bid them all home, he's gone, and we'll no further.
SICINIUS:
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
SICINIUS:
In his behalf.
BRUTUS:
Now we have shown our power,
BRUTUS:
Let us seem humbler after it is done
BRUTUS:
Than when it was a-doing.
SICINIUS:
Bid them home
SICINIUS:
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
SICINIUS:
Stand in their ancient strength.
BRUTUS:
Dismiss them home.
BRUTUS:
Exit AEdile
BRUTUS:
Here comes his mother.
SICINIUS:
Let's not meet her.
BRUTUS:
Why?
SICINIUS:
They say she's mad.
BRUTUS:
They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
BRUTUS:
Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS
VOLUMNIA:
O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
VOLUMNIA:
Requite your love!
MENENIUS:
Peace, peace, be not so loud.
VOLUMNIA:
If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
VOLUMNIA:
Nay, and you shall hear some.
VOLUMNIA:
To BRUTUS
VOLUMNIA:
Will you be gone?
VIRGILIA:
[To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too: I would I had the power
VIRGILIA:
To say so to my husband.
SICINIUS:
Are  you mankind?
VOLUMNIA:
Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this fool.
VOLUMNIA:
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
VOLUMNIA:
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
VOLUMNIA:
Than thou hast spoken words?
SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!
VOLUMNIA:
More noble blows than ever thou wise words,
VOLUMNIA:
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what, yet go
VOLUMNIA:
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
VOLUMNIA:
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
VOLUMNIA:
His good sword in his hand.
SICINIUS:
What then?
VIRGILIA:
What then!
VIRGILIA:
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and all.
VOLUMNIA:
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
MENENIUS:
Come, come, peace.
SICINIUS:
I would he had continued to his country
SICINIUS:
As he began, and not unknit himself
SICINIUS:
The noble knot he made.
BRUTUS:
I would he had.
VOLUMNIA:
'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble
VOLUMNIA:
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
VOLUMNIA:
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
VOLUMNIA:
Will not have earth to know.
BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.
VOLUMNIA:
Now, pray, sir, get you gone
VOLUMNIA:
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
VOLUMNIA:
As far as doth the Capitol exceed
VOLUMNIA:
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
VOLUMNIA:
This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
VOLUMNIA:
Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.
BRUTUS:
Well, well, we'll leave you.
SICINIUS:
Why stay we to be baited
SICINIUS:
With one that wants her wits?
VOLUMNIA:
Take my prayers with you.
VOLUMNIA:
Exeunt Tribunes
VOLUMNIA:
I would the gods had nothing else to do
VOLUMNIA:
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
VOLUMNIA:
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
VOLUMNIA:
Of what lies heavy to't.
MENENIUS:
You have told them home,
MENENIUS:
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
VOLUMNIA:
Anger's my meat, I sup upon myself,
VOLUMNIA:
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go
VOLUMNIA:
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
VOLUMNIA:
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!
MENENIUS:
Exeunt
MENENIUS:
SCENE III. A highway between Rome and Antium.
MENENIUS:
Enter a Roman and a Volsce, meeting
Roman:
I know you well, sir, and you know
Roman:
me: your name, I think, is Adrian.
Volsce:
It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.
Roman:
I am a Roman, and my services are,
Roman:
as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?
Volsce:
Nicanor? no.
Roman:
The same, sir.
Volsce:
You had more beard when I last saw you, but your
Volsce:
favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
Volsce:
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
Volsce:
to find you out there: you have well saved me a
Volsce:
day's journey.
Roman:
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections, the
Roman:
people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
Volsce:
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
Volsce:
so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
Volsce:
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
Roman:
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
Roman:
would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
Roman:
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Roman:
Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
Roman:
all power from the people and to pluck from them
Roman:
their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
Roman:
tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
Roman:
breaking out.
Volsce:
Coriolanus banished!
Roman:
Banished, sir.
Volsce:
You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
Roman:
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
Roman:
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
Roman:
when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
Roman:
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
Roman:
great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
Roman:
of his country.
Volsce:
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
Volsce:
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
Volsce:
business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
Roman:
I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
Roman:
strange things from Rome, all tending to the good of
Roman:
their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
Volsce:
A most royal one, the centurions and their charges,
Volsce:
distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
Volsce:
and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
Roman:
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
Roman:
man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
Roman:
So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
Volsce:
You take my part from me, sir, I have the most cause
Volsce:
to be glad of yours.
Roman:
Well, let us go together.
Roman:
Exeunt
Roman:
SCENE IV. Antium. Before Aufidius's house.
Roman:
Enter CORIOLANUS in mean apparel, disguised and muffled
CORIOLANUS:
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
CORIOLANUS:
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
CORIOLANUS:
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
CORIOLANUS:
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
CORIOLANUS:
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
CORIOLANUS:
In puny battle slay me.
CORIOLANUS:
Enter a Citizen
CORIOLANUS:
Save you, sir.
Citizen:
And you.
CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be your will,
CORIOLANUS:
Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?
Citizen:
He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
Citizen:
At his house this night.
CORIOLANUS:
Which is his house, beseech you?
Citizen:
This, here before you.
CORIOLANUS:
Thank you, sir: farewell.
CORIOLANUS:
Exit Citizen
CORIOLANUS:
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
CORIOLANUS:
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
CORIOLANUS:
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
CORIOLANUS:
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
CORIOLANUS:
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
CORIOLANUS:
On a dissension of a doit, break out
CORIOLANUS:
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
CORIOLANUS:
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
CORIOLANUS:
To take the one the other, by some chance,
CORIOLANUS:
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
CORIOLANUS:
And interjoin their issues. So with me
CORIOLANUS:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
CORIOLANUS:
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
CORIOLANUS:
He does fair justice, if he give me way,
CORIOLANUS:
I'll do his country service.
CORIOLANUS:
Exit
CORIOLANUS:
SCENE V. The same. A hall in Aufidius's house.
CORIOLANUS:
Music within. Enter a Servingman
First Servingman:
Wine, wine, wine! What service
First Servingman:
is here! I think our fellows are asleep.
First Servingman:
Exit
First Servingman:
Enter a second Servingman
Second Servingman:
Where's Cotus? my master calls
Second Servingman:
for him. Cotus!
Second Servingman:
Exit
Second Servingman:
Enter CORIOLANUS
CORIOLANUS:
A goodly house: the feast smells well, but I
CORIOLANUS:
Appear not like a guest.
CORIOLANUS:
Re-enter the first Servingman
First Servingman:
What would you have, friend? whence are you?
First Servingman:
Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
First Servingman:
Exit
CORIOLANUS:
I have deserved no better entertainment,
CORIOLANUS:
In being Coriolanus.
CORIOLANUS:
Re-enter second Servingman
Second Servingman:
Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
Second Servingman:
head, that he gives entrance to such companions?
Second Servingman:
Pray, get you out.
CORIOLANUS:
Away!
Second Servingman:
Away! get you away.
CORIOLANUS:
Now thou'rt troublesome.
Second Servingman:
Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
Second Servingman:
Enter a third Servingman. The first meets him
Third Servingman:
What fellow's this?
First Servingman:
A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
First Servingman:
out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.
First Servingman:
Retires
Third Servingman:
What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
Third Servingman:
the house.
CORIOLANUS:
Let me but stand, I will not hurt your hearth.
Third Servingman:
What are you?
CORIOLANUS:
A gentleman.
Third Servingman:
A marvellous poor one.
CORIOLANUS:
True, so I am.
Third Servingman:
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
Third Servingman:
station, here's no place for you, pray you, avoid: come.
CORIOLANUS:
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
CORIOLANUS:
Pushes him away
Third Servingman:
What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
Third Servingman:
strange guest he has here.
Second Servingman:
And I shall.
Second Servingman:
Exit
Third Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?
CORIOLANUS:
Under the canopy.
Third Servingman:
Under the canopy!
CORIOLANUS:
Ay.
Third Servingman:
Where's that?
CORIOLANUS:
I' the city of kites and crows.
Third Servingman:
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Third Servingman:
Then thou dwellest with daws too?
CORIOLANUS:
No, I serve not thy master.
Third Servingman:
How, sir! do you meddle with my master?
CORIOLANUS:
Ay, 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
CORIOLANUS:
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest, serve with thy
CORIOLANUS:
trencher, hence!
CORIOLANUS:
Beats him away. Exit third Servingman
CORIOLANUS:
Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman
AUFIDIUS:
Where is this fellow?
Second Servingman:
Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
Second Servingman:
disturbing the lords within.
Second Servingman:
Retires
AUFIDIUS:
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
AUFIDIUS:
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
CORIOLANUS:
If, Tullus,
CORIOLANUS:
Unmuffling
CORIOLANUS:
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
CORIOLANUS:
Think me for the man I am, necessity
CORIOLANUS:
Commands me name myself.
AUFIDIUS:
What is thy name?
CORIOLANUS:
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
CORIOLANUS:
And harsh in sound to thine.
AUFIDIUS:
Say, what's thy name?
AUFIDIUS:
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
AUFIDIUS:
Bears a command in't, though thy tackle's torn.
AUFIDIUS:
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
CORIOLANUS:
thou me yet?
AUFIDIUS:
I know thee not: thy name?
CORIOLANUS:
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
CORIOLANUS:
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
CORIOLANUS:
Great hurt and mischief, thereto witness may
CORIOLANUS:
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
CORIOLANUS:
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
CORIOLANUS:
Shed for my thankless country are requited
CORIOLANUS:
But with that surname, a good memory,
CORIOLANUS:
And witness of the malice and displeasure
CORIOLANUS:
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains,
CORIOLANUS:
The cruelty and envy of the people,
CORIOLANUS:
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
CORIOLANUS:
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest,
CORIOLANUS:
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
CORIOLANUS:
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
CORIOLANUS:
Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope--
CORIOLANUS:
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
CORIOLANUS:
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
CORIOLANUS:
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
CORIOLANUS:
To be full quit of those my banishers,
CORIOLANUS:
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
CORIOLANUS:
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
CORIOLANUS:
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
CORIOLANUS:
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
CORIOLANUS:
thee straight,
CORIOLANUS:
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
CORIOLANUS:
That my revengeful services may prove
CORIOLANUS:
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
CORIOLANUS:
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
CORIOLANUS:
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
CORIOLANUS:
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
CORIOLANUS:
Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
CORIOLANUS:
Longer to live most weary, and present
CORIOLANUS:
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice,
CORIOLANUS:
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
CORIOLANUS:
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
CORIOLANUS:
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
CORIOLANUS:
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
CORIOLANUS:
It be to do thee service.
AUFIDIUS:
O Marcius, Marcius!
AUFIDIUS:
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
AUFIDIUS:
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
AUFIDIUS:
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
AUFIDIUS:
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
AUFIDIUS:
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
AUFIDIUS:
Mine arms about that body, where against
AUFIDIUS:
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
AUFIDIUS:
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
AUFIDIUS:
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
AUFIDIUS:
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
AUFIDIUS:
As ever in ambitious strength I did
AUFIDIUS:
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
AUFIDIUS:
I loved the maid I married, never man
AUFIDIUS:
Sigh'd truer breath, but that I see thee here,
AUFIDIUS:
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
AUFIDIUS:
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
AUFIDIUS:
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
AUFIDIUS:
We have a power on foot, and I had purpose
AUFIDIUS:
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
AUFIDIUS:
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
AUFIDIUS:
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
AUFIDIUS:
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me,
AUFIDIUS:
We have been down together in my sleep,
AUFIDIUS:
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
AUFIDIUS:
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
AUFIDIUS:
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
AUFIDIUS:
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
AUFIDIUS:
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
AUFIDIUS:
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
AUFIDIUS:
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
AUFIDIUS:
And take our friendly senators by the hands,
AUFIDIUS:
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
AUFIDIUS:
Who am prepared against your territories,
AUFIDIUS:
Though not for Rome itself.
CORIOLANUS:
You bless me, gods!
AUFIDIUS:
Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
AUFIDIUS:
The leading of thine own revenges, take
AUFIDIUS:
The one half of my commission, and set down--
AUFIDIUS:
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
AUFIDIUS:
Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways,
AUFIDIUS:
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
AUFIDIUS:
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
AUFIDIUS:
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in
AUFIDIUS:
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
AUFIDIUS:
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
AUFIDIUS:
And more a friend than e'er an enemy,
AUFIDIUS:
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
AUFIDIUS:
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward
First Servingman:
Here's a strange alteration!
Second Servingman:
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
Second Servingman:
a cudgel, and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
Second Servingman:
false report of him.
First Servingman:
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
First Servingman:
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
Second Servingman:
Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
Second Servingman:
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
Second Servingman:
cannot tell how to term it.
First Servingman:
He had so, looking as it were--would I were hanged,
First Servingman:
but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
Second Servingman:
So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
Second Servingman:
man i' the world.
First Servingman:
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
Second Servingman:
Who, my master?
First Servingman:
Nay, it's no matter for that.
Second Servingman:
Worth six on him.
First Servingman:
Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
First Servingman:
greater soldier.
Second Servingman:
Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that
Second Servingman:
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.
First Servingman:
Ay, and for an assault too.
First Servingman:
Re-enter third Servingman
Third Servingman:
O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
Second Servingman:
What, what, what? let's partake.
Third Servingman:
I would not be a Roman, of all nations, I had as
Third Servingman:
lieve be a condemned man.
Second Servingman:
Wherefore? wherefore?
Third Servingman:
Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
Third Servingman:
Caius Marcius.
First Servingman:
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
Third Servingman:
I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always
Third Servingman:
good enough for him.
Second Servingman:
Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
Second Servingman:
hard for him, I have heard him say so himself.
First Servingman:
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
First Servingman:
on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
First Servingman:
him like a carbon ado.
Second Servingman:
An he had been cannibally given, he might have
Second Servingman:
broiled and eaten him too.
First Servingman:
But, more of thy news?
Third Servingman:
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
Third Servingman:
and heir to Mars, set at upper end o' the table, no
Third Servingman:
question asked him by any of the senators, but they
Third Servingman:
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
Third Servingman:
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
Third Servingman:
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
Third Servingman:
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
Third Servingman:
the middle and but one half of what he was
Third Servingman:
yesterday, for the other has half, by the entreaty
Third Servingman:
and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
Third Servingman:
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
Third Servingman:
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.
Second Servingman:
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
Third Servingman:
Do't! he will do't, for, look you, sir, he has as
Third Servingman:
many friends as enemies, which friends, sir, as it
Third Servingman:
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
Third Servingman:
we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.
First Servingman:
Directitude! what's that?
Third Servingman:
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
Third Servingman:
and the man in blood, they will out of their
Third Servingman:
burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
Third Servingman:
him.
First Servingman:
But when goes this forward?
Third Servingman:
To-morrow, to-day, presently, you shall have the
Third Servingman:
drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
Third Servingman:
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
Third Servingman:
wipe their lips.
Second Servingman:
Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
Second Servingman:
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
Second Servingman:
tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
First Servingman:
Let me have war, say I, it exceeds peace as far as
First Servingman:
day does night, it's spritely, waking, audible, and
First Servingman:
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy,
First Servingman:
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible, a getter of more
First Servingman:
bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
Second Servingman:
'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
Second Servingman:
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
Second Servingman:
great maker of cuckolds.
First Servingman:
Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
Third Servingman:
Reason, because they then less need one another.
Third Servingman:
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
Third Servingman:
as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
All:
In, in, in, in!
All:
Exeunt
All:
SCENE VI. Rome. A public place.
All:
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
SICINIUS:
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him,
SICINIUS:
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
SICINIUS:
And quietness of the people, which before
SICINIUS:
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
SICINIUS:
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
SICINIUS:
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
SICINIUS:
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
SICINIUS:
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
SICINIUS:
About their functions friendly.
BRUTUS:
We stood to't in good time.
BRUTUS:
Enter MENENIUS
BRUTUS:
Is this Menenius?
SICINIUS:
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.
Both Tribunes:
Hail sir!
MENENIUS:
Hail to you both!
SICINIUS:
Your Coriolanus
SICINIUS:
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends
SICINIUS:
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
SICINIUS:
Were he more angry at it.
MENENIUS:
All's well, and might have been much better, if
MENENIUS:
He could have temporized.
SICINIUS:
Where is he, hear you?
MENENIUS:
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
MENENIUS:
Hear nothing from him.
MENENIUS:
Enter three or four Citizens
Citizens:
The gods preserve you both!
SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbours.
BRUTUS:
God-den to you all, god-den to you all.
First Citizen:
Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
First Citizen:
Are bound to pray for you both.
SICINIUS:
Live, and thrive!
BRUTUS:
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
BRUTUS:
Had loved you as we did.
Citizens:
Now the gods keep you!
Both Tribunes:
Farewell, farewell.
Both Tribunes:
Exeunt Citizens
SICINIUS:
This is a happier and more comely time
SICINIUS:
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
SICINIUS:
Crying confusion.
BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius was
BRUTUS:
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
BRUTUS:
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
BRUTUS:
Self-loving,--
SICINIUS:
And affecting one sole throne,
SICINIUS:
Without assistance.
MENENIUS:
I think not so.
SICINIUS:
We should by this, to all our lamentation,
SICINIUS:
If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
BRUTUS:
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
BRUTUS:
Sits safe and still without him.
BRUTUS:
Enter an AEdile
AEdile:
Worthy tribunes,
AEdile:
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
AEdile:
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
AEdile:
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
AEdile:
And with the deepest malice of the war
AEdile:
Destroy what lies before 'em.
MENENIUS:
'Tis Aufidius,
MENENIUS:
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
MENENIUS:
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,
MENENIUS:
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
MENENIUS:
And durst not once peep out.
SICINIUS:
Come, what talk you
SICINIUS:
Of Marcius?
BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
BRUTUS:
The Volsces dare break with us.
MENENIUS:
Cannot be!
MENENIUS:
We have record that very well it can,
MENENIUS:
And three examples of the like have been
MENENIUS:
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
MENENIUS:
Before you punish him, where he heard this,
MENENIUS:
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
MENENIUS:
And beat the messenger who bids beware
MENENIUS:
Of what is to be dreaded.
SICINIUS:
Tell not me
SICINIUS:
I know this cannot be.
BRUTUS:
Not possible.
BRUTUS:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
The nobles in great earnestness are going
Messenger:
All to the senate-house: some news is come
Messenger:
That turns their countenances.
SICINIUS:
'Tis this slave,--
SICINIUS:
Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising,
SICINIUS:
Nothing but his report.
Messenger:
Yes, worthy sir,
Messenger:
The slave's report is seconded, and more,
Messenger:
More fearful, is deliver'd.
SICINIUS:
What more fearful?
Messenger:
It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
Messenger:
How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
Messenger:
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
Messenger:
And vows revenge as spacious as between
Messenger:
The young'st and oldest thing.
SICINIUS:
This is most likely!
BRUTUS:
Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
BRUTUS:
Good Marcius home again.
SICINIUS:
The very trick on't.
MENENIUS:
This is unlikely
MENENIUS:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
MENENIUS:
Than violentest contrariety.
MENENIUS:
Enter a second Messenger
Second Messenger:
You are sent for to the senate
Second Messenger:
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
Second Messenger:
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Second Messenger:
Upon our territories, and have already
Second Messenger:
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
Second Messenger:
What lay before them.
Second Messenger:
Enter COMINIUS
COMINIUS:
O, you have made good work!
MENENIUS:
What news? what news?
COMINIUS:
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
COMINIUS:
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
COMINIUS:
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--
MENENIUS:
What's the news? what's the news?
COMINIUS:
Your temples burned in their cement, and
COMINIUS:
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
COMINIUS:
Into an auger's bore.
MENENIUS:
Pray now, your news?
MENENIUS:
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
MENENIUS:
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--
COMINIUS:
If!
COMINIUS:
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
COMINIUS:
Made by some other deity than nature,
COMINIUS:
That shapes man better, and they follow him,
COMINIUS:
Against us brats, with no less confidence
COMINIUS:
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
COMINIUS:
Or butchers killing flies.
MENENIUS:
You have made good work,
MENENIUS:
You and your apron-men, you that stood so up much
MENENIUS:
on the voice of occupation and
MENENIUS:
The breath of garlic-eaters!
COMINIUS:
He will shake
COMINIUS:
Your Rome about your ears.
MENENIUS:
As Hercules
MENENIUS:
Did shake down mellow fruit.
MENENIUS:
You have made fair work!
BRUTUS:
But is this true, sir?
COMINIUS:
Ay, and you'll look pale
COMINIUS:
Before you find it other. All the regions
COMINIUS:
Do smilingly revolt, and who resist
COMINIUS:
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
COMINIUS:
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
COMINIUS:
Your enemies and his find something in him.
MENENIUS:
We are all undone, unless
MENENIUS:
The noble man have mercy.
COMINIUS:
Who shall ask it?
COMINIUS:
The tribunes cannot do't for shame, the people
COMINIUS:
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
COMINIUS:
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
COMINIUS:
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
COMINIUS:
As those should do that had deserved his hate,
COMINIUS:
And therein show'd like enemies.
MENENIUS:
'Tis true
MENENIUS:
If he were putting to my house the brand
MENENIUS:
That should consume it, I have not the face
MENENIUS:
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
MENENIUS:
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
COMINIUS:
You have brought
COMINIUS:
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
COMINIUS:
So incapable of help.
Both Tribunes:
Say not we brought it.
MENENIUS:
How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
MENENIUS:
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
MENENIUS:
Who did hoot him out o' the city.
COMINIUS:
But I fear
COMINIUS:
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
COMINIUS:
The second name of men, obeys his points
COMINIUS:
As if he were his officer: desperation
COMINIUS:
Is all the policy, strength and defence,
COMINIUS:
That Rome can make against them.
COMINIUS:
Enter a troop of Citizens
MENENIUS:
Here come the clusters.
MENENIUS:
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
MENENIUS:
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
MENENIUS:
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
MENENIUS:
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming,
MENENIUS:
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
MENENIUS:
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
MENENIUS:
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
MENENIUS:
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter,
MENENIUS:
if he could burn us all into one coal,
MENENIUS:
We have deserved it.
Citizens:
Faith, we hear fearful news.
First Citizen:
For mine own part,
First Citizen:
When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
Second Citizen:
And so did I.
Third Citizen:
And so did I, and, to say the truth, so did very
Third Citizen:
many of us: that we did, we did for the best, and
Third Citizen:
though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
Third Citizen:
it was against our will.
COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things, you voices!
MENENIUS:
You have made
MENENIUS:
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
COMINIUS:
O, ay, what else?
COMINIUS:
Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
SICINIUS:
Go, masters, get you home, be not dismay'd
SICINIUS:
These are a side that would be glad to have
SICINIUS:
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
SICINIUS:
And show no sign of fear.
First Citizen:
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
First Citizen:
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
First Citizen:
him.
Second Citizen:
So did we all. But, come, let's home.
Second Citizen:
Exeunt Citizens
BRUTUS:
I do not like this news.
SICINIUS:
Nor I.
BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
BRUTUS:
Would buy this for a lie!
SICINIUS:
Pray, let us go.
SICINIUS:
Exeunt
SICINIUS:
SCENE VII. A camp, at a small distance from Rome.
SICINIUS:
Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant
AUFIDIUS:
Do they still fly to the Roman?
Lieutenant:
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
Lieutenant:
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Lieutenant:
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end,
Lieutenant:
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
Lieutenant:
Even by your own.
AUFIDIUS:
I cannot help it now,
AUFIDIUS:
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
AUFIDIUS:
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
AUFIDIUS:
Even to my person, than I thought he would
AUFIDIUS:
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
AUFIDIUS:
In that's no changeling, and I must excuse
AUFIDIUS:
What cannot be amended.
Lieutenant:
Yet I wish, sir,--
Lieutenant:
I mean for your particular,--you had not
Lieutenant:
Join'd in commission with him, but either
Lieutenant:
Had borne the action of yourself, or else
Lieutenant:
To him had left it solely.
AUFIDIUS:
I understand thee well, and be thou sure,
AUFIDIUS:
when he shall come to his account, he knows not
AUFIDIUS:
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
AUFIDIUS:
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
AUFIDIUS:
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
AUFIDIUS:
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
AUFIDIUS:
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
AUFIDIUS:
As draw his sword, yet he hath left undone
AUFIDIUS:
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
AUFIDIUS:
Whene'er we come to our account.
Lieutenant:
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
AUFIDIUS:
All places yield to him ere he sits down,
AUFIDIUS:
And the nobility of Rome are his
AUFIDIUS:
The senators and patricians love him too
AUFIDIUS:
The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people
AUFIDIUS:
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
AUFIDIUS:
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
AUFIDIUS:
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
AUFIDIUS:
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
AUFIDIUS:
A noble servant to them, but he could not
AUFIDIUS:
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
AUFIDIUS:
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
AUFIDIUS:
The happy man, whether defect of judgment,
AUFIDIUS:
To fail in the disposing of those chances
AUFIDIUS:
Which he was lord of, or whether nature,
AUFIDIUS:
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
AUFIDIUS:
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
AUFIDIUS:
Even with the same austerity and garb
AUFIDIUS:
As he controll'd the war, but one of these--
AUFIDIUS:
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
AUFIDIUS:
For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
AUFIDIUS:
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
AUFIDIUS:
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
AUFIDIUS:
Lie in the interpretation of the time
AUFIDIUS:
And power, unto itself most commendable,
AUFIDIUS:
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
AUFIDIUS:
To extol what it hath done.
AUFIDIUS:
One fire drives out one fire, one nail, one nail,
AUFIDIUS:
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
AUFIDIUS:
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
AUFIDIUS:
Thou art poor'st of all, then shortly art thou mine.
AUFIDIUS:
Exeunt
AUFIDIUS:
ACT V
AUFIDIUS:
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.
AUFIDIUS:
Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and others
MENENIUS:
No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
MENENIUS:
Which was sometime his general, who loved him
MENENIUS:
In a most dear particular. He call'd me father
MENENIUS:
But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him,
MENENIUS:
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
MENENIUS:
The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
MENENIUS:
To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
COMINIUS:
He would not seem to know me.
MENENIUS:
Do you hear?
COMINIUS:
Yet one time he did call me by my name
COMINIUS:
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
COMINIUS:
That we have bled together. Coriolanus
COMINIUS:
He would not answer to: forbad all names,
COMINIUS:
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
COMINIUS:
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
COMINIUS:
Of burning Rome.
MENENIUS:
Why, so: you have made good work!
MENENIUS:
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
MENENIUS:
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
COMINIUS:
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
COMINIUS:
When it was less expected: he replied,
COMINIUS:
It was a bare petition of a state
COMINIUS:
To one whom they had punish'd.
MENENIUS:
Very well
MENENIUS:
Could he say less?
COMINIUS:
I offer'd to awaken his regard
COMINIUS:
For's private friends: his answer to me was,
COMINIUS:
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
COMINIUS:
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
COMINIUS:
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
COMINIUS:
And still to nose the offence.
MENENIUS:
For one poor grain or two!
MENENIUS:
I am one of those, his mother, wife, his child,
MENENIUS:
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains
MENENIUS:
You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt
MENENIUS:
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
SICINIUS:
Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
SICINIUS:
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
SICINIUS:
Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
SICINIUS:
Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
SICINIUS:
More than the instant army we can make,
SICINIUS:
Might stop our countryman.
MENENIUS:
No, I'll not meddle.
SICINIUS:
Pray you, go to him.
MENENIUS:
What should I do?
BRUTUS:
Only make trial what your love can do
BRUTUS:
For Rome, towards Marcius.
MENENIUS:
Well, and say that Marcius
MENENIUS:
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
MENENIUS:
Unheard, what then?
MENENIUS:
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
MENENIUS:
With his unkindness? say't be so?
SICINIUS:
Yet your good will
SICINIUS:
must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
SICINIUS:
As you intended well.
MENENIUS:
I'll undertake 't
MENENIUS:
I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
MENENIUS:
And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
MENENIUS:
He was not taken well, he had not dined
MENENIUS:
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
MENENIUS:
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
MENENIUS:
To give or to forgive, but when we have stuff'd
MENENIUS:
These and these conveyances of our blood
MENENIUS:
With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
MENENIUS:
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
MENENIUS:
Till he be dieted to my request,
MENENIUS:
And then I'll set upon him.
BRUTUS:
You know the very road into his kindness,
BRUTUS:
And cannot lose your way.
MENENIUS:
Good faith, I'll prove him,
MENENIUS:
Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
MENENIUS:
Of my success.
MENENIUS:
Exit
COMINIUS:
He'll never hear him.
SICINIUS:
Not?
COMINIUS:
I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
COMINIUS:
Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury
COMINIUS:
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him,
COMINIUS:
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise,' dismiss'd me
COMINIUS:
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
COMINIUS:
He sent in writing after me, what he would not,
COMINIUS:
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
COMINIUS:
So that all hope is vain.
COMINIUS:
Unless his noble mother, and his wife,
COMINIUS:
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
COMINIUS:
For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
COMINIUS:
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.
COMINIUS:
Exeunt
COMINIUS:
SCENE II. Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.
COMINIUS:
Two Sentinels on guard.
COMINIUS:
Enter to them, MENENIUS
First Senator:
Stay: whence are you?
Second Senator:
Stand, and go back.
MENENIUS:
You guard like men, 'tis well: but, by your leave,
MENENIUS:
I am an officer of state, and come
MENENIUS:
To speak with Coriolanus.
First Senator:
From whence?
MENENIUS:
From Rome.
First Senator:
You may not pass, you must return: our general
First Senator:
Will no more hear from thence.
Second Senator:
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
Second Senator:
You'll speak with Coriolanus.
MENENIUS:
Good my friends,
MENENIUS:
If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
MENENIUS:
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
MENENIUS:
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
First Senator:
Be it so, go back: the virtue of your name
First Senator:
Is not here passable.
MENENIUS:
I tell thee, fellow,
MENENIUS:
The general is my lover: I have been
MENENIUS:
The book of his good acts, whence men have read
MENENIUS:
His name unparallel'd, haply amplified,
MENENIUS:
For I have ever verified my friends,
MENENIUS:
Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
MENENIUS:
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
MENENIUS:
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
MENENIUS:
I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise
MENENIUS:
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
MENENIUS:
I must have leave to pass.
First Senator:
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
First Senator:
behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
First Senator:
should not pass here, no, though it were as virtuous
First Senator:
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.
MENENIUS:
Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
MENENIUS:
always factionary on the party of your general.
Second Senator:
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
Second Senator:
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
Second Senator:
say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.
MENENIUS:
Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
MENENIUS:
speak with him till after dinner.
First Senator:
You are a Roman, are you?
MENENIUS:
I am, as thy general is.
First Senator:
Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
First Senator:
when you have pushed out your gates the very
First Senator:
defender of them, and, in a violent popular
First Senator:
ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
First Senator:
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
First Senator:
women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
First Senator:
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
First Senator:
you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
First Senator:
intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
First Senator:
such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived,
First Senator:
therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
First Senator:
execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
First Senator:
you out of reprieve and pardon.
MENENIUS:
Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
MENENIUS:
use me with estimation.
Second Senator:
Come, my captain knows you not.
MENENIUS:
I mean, thy general.
First Senator:
My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go, lest
First Senator:
I let forth your half-pint of blood, back,--that's
First Senator:
the utmost of your having: back.
MENENIUS:
Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--
MENENIUS:
Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
CORIOLANUS:
What's the matter?
MENENIUS:
Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you
MENENIUS:
You shall know now that I am in estimation, you shall
MENENIUS:
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
MENENIUS:
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
MENENIUS:
with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
MENENIUS:
hanging, or of some death more long in
MENENIUS:
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering, behold now
MENENIUS:
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
MENENIUS:
To CORIOLANUS
MENENIUS:
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
MENENIUS:
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
MENENIUS:
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
MENENIUS:
thou art preparing fire for us, look thee, here's
MENENIUS:
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
MENENIUS:
thee, but being assured none but myself could move
MENENIUS:
thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
MENENIUS:
sighs, and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
MENENIUS:
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
MENENIUS:
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
MENENIUS:
here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
MENENIUS:
access to thee.
CORIOLANUS:
Away!
MENENIUS:
How! away!
CORIOLANUS:
Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
CORIOLANUS:
Are servanted to others: though I owe
CORIOLANUS:
My revenge properly, my remission lies
CORIOLANUS:
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
CORIOLANUS:
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
CORIOLANUS:
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
CORIOLANUS:
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
CORIOLANUS:
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
CORIOLANUS:
Take this along, I writ it for thy sake
CORIOLANUS:
Gives a letter
CORIOLANUS:
And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
CORIOLANUS:
I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
CORIOLANUS:
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
AUFIDIUS:
You keep a constant temper.
AUFIDIUS:
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
First Senator:
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
Second Senator:
'Tis a spell, you see, of much  power: you know the
Second Senator:
way home again.
First Senator:
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
First Senator:
greatness back?
Second Senator:
What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
MENENIUS:
I neither care for the world nor your general: for
MENENIUS:
such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
MENENIUS:
ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
MENENIUS:
himself fears it not from another: let your general
MENENIUS:
do his worst. For you, be that you are, long, and
MENENIUS:
your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
MENENIUS:
as I was said to, Away!
MENENIUS:
Exit
First Senator:
A noble fellow, I warrant him.
Second Senator:
The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
Second Senator:
oak not to be wind-shaken.
Second Senator:
Exeunt
Second Senator:
SCENE III. The tent of Coriolanus.
Second Senator:
Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others
CORIOLANUS:
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
CORIOLANUS:
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
CORIOLANUS:
You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
CORIOLANUS:
I have borne this business.
AUFIDIUS:
Only their ends
AUFIDIUS:
You have respected, stopp'd your ears against
AUFIDIUS:
The general suit of Rome, never admitted
AUFIDIUS:
A private whisper, no, not with such friends
AUFIDIUS:
That thought them sure of you.
CORIOLANUS:
This last old man,
CORIOLANUS:
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
CORIOLANUS:
Loved me above the measure of a father,
CORIOLANUS:
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
CORIOLANUS:
Was to send him, for whose old love I have,
CORIOLANUS:
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
CORIOLANUS:
The first conditions, which they did refuse
CORIOLANUS:
And cannot now accept, to grace him only
CORIOLANUS:
That thought he could do more, a very little
CORIOLANUS:
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
CORIOLANUS:
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
CORIOLANUS:
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
CORIOLANUS:
Shout within
CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
CORIOLANUS:
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
CORIOLANUS:
Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants
CORIOLANUS:
My wife comes foremost, then the honour'd mould
CORIOLANUS:
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
CORIOLANUS:
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
CORIOLANUS:
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
CORIOLANUS:
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
CORIOLANUS:
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
CORIOLANUS:
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
CORIOLANUS:
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,
CORIOLANUS:
As if Olympus to a molehill should
CORIOLANUS:
In supplication nod: and my young boy
CORIOLANUS:
Hath an aspect of intercession, which
CORIOLANUS:
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
CORIOLANUS:
Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
CORIOLANUS:
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
CORIOLANUS:
As if a man were author of himself
CORIOLANUS:
And knew no other kin.
VIRGILIA:
My lord and husband!
CORIOLANUS:
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
VIRGILIA:
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
VIRGILIA:
Makes you think so.
CORIOLANUS:
Like a dull actor now,
CORIOLANUS:
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
CORIOLANUS:
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
CORIOLANUS:
Forgive my tyranny, but do not say
CORIOLANUS:
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
CORIOLANUS:
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
CORIOLANUS:
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
CORIOLANUS:
I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
CORIOLANUS:
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
CORIOLANUS:
And the most noble mother of the world
CORIOLANUS:
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth,
CORIOLANUS:
Kneels
CORIOLANUS:
Of thy deep duty more impression show
CORIOLANUS:
Than that of common sons.
VOLUMNIA:
O, stand up blest!
VOLUMNIA:
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
VOLUMNIA:
I kneel before thee, and unproperly
VOLUMNIA:
Show duty, as mistaken all this while
VOLUMNIA:
Between the child and parent.
VOLUMNIA:
Kneels
CORIOLANUS:
What is this?
CORIOLANUS:
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
CORIOLANUS:
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
CORIOLANUS:
Fillip the stars, then let the mutinous winds
CORIOLANUS:
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun,
CORIOLANUS:
Murdering impossibility, to make
CORIOLANUS:
What cannot be, slight work.
VOLUMNIA:
Thou art my warrior,
VOLUMNIA:
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
CORIOLANUS:
The noble sister of Publicola,
CORIOLANUS:
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
CORIOLANUS:
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
CORIOLANUS:
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
VOLUMNIA:
This is a poor epitome of yours,
VOLUMNIA:
Which by the interpretation of full time
VOLUMNIA:
May show like all yourself.
CORIOLANUS:
The god of soldiers,
CORIOLANUS:
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
CORIOLANUS:
Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove
CORIOLANUS:
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
CORIOLANUS:
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
CORIOLANUS:
And saving those that eye thee!
VOLUMNIA:
Your knee, sirrah.
CORIOLANUS:
That's my brave boy!
VOLUMNIA:
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
VOLUMNIA:
Are suitors to you.
CORIOLANUS:
I beseech you, peace
CORIOLANUS:
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before
CORIOLANUS:
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
CORIOLANUS:
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
CORIOLANUS:
Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
CORIOLANUS:
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
CORIOLANUS:
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
CORIOLANUS:
To ally my rages and revenges with
CORIOLANUS:
Your colder reasons.
VOLUMNIA:
O, no more, no more!
VOLUMNIA:
You have said you will not grant us any thing,
VOLUMNIA:
For we have nothing else to ask, but that
VOLUMNIA:
Which you deny already: yet we will ask,
VOLUMNIA:
That, if you fail in our request, the blame
VOLUMNIA:
May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
CORIOLANUS:
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark, for we'll
CORIOLANUS:
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
VOLUMNIA:
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
VOLUMNIA:
And state of bodies would bewray what life
VOLUMNIA:
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
VOLUMNIA:
How more unfortunate than all living women
VOLUMNIA:
Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
VOLUMNIA:
which should
VOLUMNIA:
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
VOLUMNIA:
with comforts,
VOLUMNIA:
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,
VOLUMNIA:
Making the mother, wife and child to see
VOLUMNIA:
The son, the husband and the father tearing
VOLUMNIA:
His country's bowels out. And to poor we
VOLUMNIA:
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
VOLUMNIA:
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
VOLUMNIA:
That all but we enjoy, for how can we,
VOLUMNIA:
Alas, how can we for our country pray.
VOLUMNIA:
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
VOLUMNIA:
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
VOLUMNIA:
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
VOLUMNIA:
Our comfort in the country. We must find
VOLUMNIA:
An evident calamity, though we had
VOLUMNIA:
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
VOLUMNIA:
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
VOLUMNIA:
With manacles thorough our streets, or else
VOLUMNIA:
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
VOLUMNIA:
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
VOLUMNIA:
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
VOLUMNIA:
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
VOLUMNIA:
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
VOLUMNIA:
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
VOLUMNIA:
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
VOLUMNIA:
March to assault thy country than to tread--
VOLUMNIA:
Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
VOLUMNIA:
That brought thee to this world.
VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
VIRGILIA:
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
VIRGILIA:
Living to time.
Young MARCIUS:
A' shall not tread on me,
Young MARCIUS:
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
CORIOLANUS:
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
CORIOLANUS:
I have sat too long.
CORIOLANUS:
Rising
VOLUMNIA:
Nay, go not from us thus.
VOLUMNIA:
If it were so that our request did tend
VOLUMNIA:
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
VOLUMNIA:
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
VOLUMNIA:
As poisonous of your honour: no, our suit
VOLUMNIA:
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
VOLUMNIA:
May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans,
VOLUMNIA:
'This we received,' and each in either side
VOLUMNIA:
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
VOLUMNIA:
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
VOLUMNIA:
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
VOLUMNIA:
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
VOLUMNIA:
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
VOLUMNIA:
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses,
VOLUMNIA:
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
VOLUMNIA:
But with his last attempt he wiped it out,
VOLUMNIA:
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
VOLUMNIA:
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son
VOLUMNIA:
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
VOLUMNIA:
To imitate the graces of the gods,
VOLUMNIA:
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
VOLUMNIA:
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
VOLUMNIA:
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
VOLUMNIA:
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
VOLUMNIA:
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you
VOLUMNIA:
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy
VOLUMNIA:
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
VOLUMNIA:
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
VOLUMNIA:
More bound to 's mother, yet here he lets me prate
VOLUMNIA:
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
VOLUMNIA:
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
VOLUMNIA:
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
VOLUMNIA:
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
VOLUMNIA:
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
VOLUMNIA:
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
VOLUMNIA:
Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,
VOLUMNIA:
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
VOLUMNIA:
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away
VOLUMNIA:
Down, ladies, let us shame him with our knees.
VOLUMNIA:
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
VOLUMNIA:
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end,
VOLUMNIA:
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
VOLUMNIA:
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's
VOLUMNIA:
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
VOLUMNIA:
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
VOLUMNIA:
Does reason our petition with more strength
VOLUMNIA:
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go
VOLUMNIA:
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother,
VOLUMNIA:
His wife is in Corioli and his child
VOLUMNIA:
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch
VOLUMNIA:
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
VOLUMNIA:
And then I'll speak a little.
VOLUMNIA:
He holds her by the hand, silent
CORIOLANUS:
O mother, mother!
CORIOLANUS:
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
CORIOLANUS:
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
CORIOLANUS:
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
CORIOLANUS:
You have won a happy victory to Rome,
CORIOLANUS:
But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
CORIOLANUS:
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
CORIOLANUS:
If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
CORIOLANUS:
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
CORIOLANUS:
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
CORIOLANUS:
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
CORIOLANUS:
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?
AUFIDIUS:
I was moved withal.
CORIOLANUS:
I dare be sworn you were
CORIOLANUS:
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
CORIOLANUS:
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
CORIOLANUS:
What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
CORIOLANUS:
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you, and pray you,
CORIOLANUS:
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
AUFIDIUS:
[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
AUFIDIUS:
thy honour
AUFIDIUS:
At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
AUFIDIUS:
Myself a former fortune.
AUFIDIUS:
The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS
CORIOLANUS:
Ay, by and by,
CORIOLANUS:
To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA,  and c
CORIOLANUS:
But we will drink together, and you shall bear
CORIOLANUS:
A better witness back than words, which we,
CORIOLANUS:
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
CORIOLANUS:
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
CORIOLANUS:
To have a temple built you: all the swords
CORIOLANUS:
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
CORIOLANUS:
Could not have made this peace.
CORIOLANUS:
Exeunt
CORIOLANUS:
SCENE IV. Rome. A public place.
CORIOLANUS:
Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS
MENENIUS:
See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
MENENIUS:
corner-stone?
SICINIUS:
Why, what of that?
MENENIUS:
If it be possible for you to displace it with your
MENENIUS:
little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
MENENIUS:
Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
MENENIUS:
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
MENENIUS:
sentenced and stay upon execution.
SICINIUS:
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
SICINIUS:
condition of a man!
MENENIUS:
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly,
MENENIUS:
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
MENENIUS:
from man to dragon: he has wings, he's more than a
MENENIUS:
creeping thing.
SICINIUS:
He loved his mother dearly.
MENENIUS:
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
MENENIUS:
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
MENENIUS:
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
MENENIUS:
moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
MENENIUS:
his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
MENENIUS:
his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a
MENENIUS:
battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
MENENIUS:
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
MENENIUS:
his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
MENENIUS:
and a heaven to throne in.
SICINIUS:
Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
MENENIUS:
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
MENENIUS:
mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
MENENIUS:
in him than there is milk in a male tiger, that
MENENIUS:
shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
MENENIUS:
you.
SICINIUS:
The gods be good unto us!
MENENIUS:
No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
MENENIUS:
us. When we banished him, we respected not them,
MENENIUS:
and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.
MENENIUS:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house
Messenger:
The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
Messenger:
And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
Messenger:
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
Messenger:
They'll give him death by inches.
Messenger:
Enter a second Messenger
SICINIUS:
What's the news?
Second Messenger:
Good news, good news, the ladies have prevail'd,
Second Messenger:
The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone
Second Messenger:
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
Second Messenger:
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
SICINIUS:
Friend,
SICINIUS:
Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
Second Messenger:
As certain as I know the sun is fire
Second Messenger:
Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
Second Messenger:
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
Second Messenger:
As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
Second Messenger:
Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together
Second Messenger:
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Second Messenger:
Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
Second Messenger:
Make the sun dance. Hark you!
Second Messenger:
A shout within
MENENIUS:
This is good news
MENENIUS:
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
MENENIUS:
Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
MENENIUS:
A city full, of tribunes, such as you,
MENENIUS:
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day
MENENIUS:
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
MENENIUS:
I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
MENENIUS:
Music still, with shouts
SICINIUS:
First, the gods bless you for your tidings, next,
SICINIUS:
Accept my thankfulness.
Second Messenger:
Sir, we have all
Second Messenger:
Great cause to give great thanks.
SICINIUS:
They are near the city?
Second Messenger:
Almost at point to enter.
SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
SICINIUS:
And help the joy.
SICINIUS:
Exeunt
SICINIUS:
SCENE V. The same. A street near the gate.
SICINIUS:
Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA,  VALERIA,  and c. passing over the stage, followed by Patricians and others
First Senator:
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
First Senator:
Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
First Senator:
And make triumphant fires, strew flowers before them
First Senator:
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
First Senator:
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother,
First Senator:
Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
All:
Welcome, ladies, Welcome!
All:
A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt
All:
SCENE VI. Antium. A public place.
All:
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants
AUFIDIUS:
Go tell the lords o' the city I am here
AUFIDIUS:
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
AUFIDIUS:
Bid them repair to the market place, where I,
AUFIDIUS:
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
AUFIDIUS:
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
AUFIDIUS:
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
AUFIDIUS:
Intends to appear before the people, hoping
AUFIDIUS:
To purge herself with words: dispatch.
AUFIDIUS:
Exeunt Attendants
AUFIDIUS:
Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction
AUFIDIUS:
Most welcome!
First Conspirator:
How is it with our general?
AUFIDIUS:
Even so
AUFIDIUS:
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
AUFIDIUS:
And with his charity slain.
Second Conspirator:
Most noble sir,
Second Conspirator:
If you do hold the same intent wherein
Second Conspirator:
You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
Second Conspirator:
Of your great danger.
AUFIDIUS:
Sir, I cannot tell
AUFIDIUS:
We must proceed as we do find the people.
Third Conspirator:
The people will remain uncertain whilst
Third Conspirator:
'Twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either
Third Conspirator:
Makes the survivor heir of all.
AUFIDIUS:
I know it,
AUFIDIUS:
And my pretext to strike at him admits
AUFIDIUS:
A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
AUFIDIUS:
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
AUFIDIUS:
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
AUFIDIUS:
Seducing so my friends, and, to this end,
AUFIDIUS:
He bow'd his nature, never known before
AUFIDIUS:
But to be rough, unswayable and free.
Third Conspirator:
Sir, his stoutness
Third Conspirator:
When he did stand for consul, which he lost
Third Conspirator:
By lack of stooping,--
AUFIDIUS:
That I would have spoke of
AUFIDIUS:
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth,
AUFIDIUS:
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him,
AUFIDIUS:
Made him joint-servant with me, gave him way
AUFIDIUS:
In all his own desires, nay, let him choose
AUFIDIUS:
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
AUFIDIUS:
My best and freshest men, served his designments
AUFIDIUS:
In mine own person, holp to reap the fame
AUFIDIUS:
Which he did end all his, and took some pride
AUFIDIUS:
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
AUFIDIUS:
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
AUFIDIUS:
He waged me with his countenance, as if
AUFIDIUS:
I had been mercenary.
First Conspirator:
So he did, my lord
First Conspirator:
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
First Conspirator:
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
First Conspirator:
For no less spoil than glory,--
AUFIDIUS:
There was it
AUFIDIUS:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
AUFIDIUS:
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
AUFIDIUS:
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
AUFIDIUS:
Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
AUFIDIUS:
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
AUFIDIUS:
Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People
First Conspirator:
Your native town you enter'd like a post,
First Conspirator:
And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
First Conspirator:
Splitting the air with noise.
Second Conspirator:
And patient fools,
Second Conspirator:
Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
Second Conspirator:
With giving him glory.
Third Conspirator:
Therefore, at your vantage,
Third Conspirator:
Ere he express himself, or move the people
Third Conspirator:
With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
Third Conspirator:
Which we will second. When he lies along,
Third Conspirator:
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
Third Conspirator:
His reasons with his body.
AUFIDIUS:
Say no more
AUFIDIUS:
Here come the lords.
AUFIDIUS:
Enter the Lords of the city
All The Lords:
You are most welcome home.
AUFIDIUS:
I have not deserved it.
AUFIDIUS:
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
AUFIDIUS:
What I have written to you?
Lords:
We have.
First Lord:
And grieve to hear't.
First Lord:
What faults he made before the last, I think
First Lord:
Might have found easy fines: but there to end
First Lord:
Where he was to begin and give away
First Lord:
The benefit of our levies, answering us
First Lord:
With our own charge, making a treaty where
First Lord:
There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.
AUFIDIUS:
He approaches: you shall hear him.
AUFIDIUS:
Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours, commoners being with him
CORIOLANUS:
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
CORIOLANUS:
No more infected with my country's love
CORIOLANUS:
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
CORIOLANUS:
Under your great command. You are to know
CORIOLANUS:
That prosperously I have attempted and
CORIOLANUS:
With bloody passage led your wars even to
CORIOLANUS:
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
CORIOLANUS:
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
CORIOLANUS:
The charges of the action. We have made peace
CORIOLANUS:
With no less honour to the Antiates
CORIOLANUS:
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
CORIOLANUS:
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
CORIOLANUS:
Together with the seal o' the senate, what
CORIOLANUS:
We have compounded on.
AUFIDIUS:
Read it not, noble lords,
AUFIDIUS:
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
AUFIDIUS:
He hath abused your powers.
CORIOLANUS:
Traitor! how now!
AUFIDIUS:
Ay, traitor, Marcius!
CORIOLANUS:
Marcius!
AUFIDIUS:
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
AUFIDIUS:
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
AUFIDIUS:
Coriolanus in Corioli?
AUFIDIUS:
You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
AUFIDIUS:
He has betray'd your business, and given up,
AUFIDIUS:
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
AUFIDIUS:
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother,
AUFIDIUS:
Breaking his oath and resolution like
AUFIDIUS:
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
AUFIDIUS:
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
AUFIDIUS:
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
AUFIDIUS:
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
AUFIDIUS:
Look'd wondering each at other.
CORIOLANUS:
Hear'st thou, Mars?
AUFIDIUS:
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
CORIOLANUS:
Ha!
AUFIDIUS:
No more.
CORIOLANUS:
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
CORIOLANUS:
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
CORIOLANUS:
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
CORIOLANUS:
I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
CORIOLANUS:
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
CORIOLANUS:
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him, that
CORIOLANUS:
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
CORIOLANUS:
To thrust the lie unto him.
First Lord:
Peace, both, and hear me speak.
CORIOLANUS:
Cut me to pieces, Volsces, men and lads,
CORIOLANUS:
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
CORIOLANUS:
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
CORIOLANUS:
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
CORIOLANUS:
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli
CORIOLANUS:
Alone I did it. Boy!
AUFIDIUS:
Why, noble lords,
AUFIDIUS:
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
AUFIDIUS:
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
AUFIDIUS:
'Fore your own eyes and ears?
All Conspirators:
Let him die for't.
All The People:
'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
All The People:
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
All The People:
Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
Second Lord:
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
Second Lord:
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
Second Lord:
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Second Lord:
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
Second Lord:
And trouble not the peace.
CORIOLANUS:
O that I had him,
CORIOLANUS:
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
CORIOLANUS:
To use my lawful sword!
AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!
All Conspirators:
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
All Conspirators:
The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body
Lords:
Hold, hold, hold, hold!
AUFIDIUS:
My noble masters, hear me speak.
First Lord:
O Tullus,--
Second Lord:
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
Third Lord:
Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet,
Third Lord:
Put up your swords.
AUFIDIUS:
My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
AUFIDIUS:
Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
AUFIDIUS:
Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
AUFIDIUS:
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
AUFIDIUS:
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
AUFIDIUS:
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
AUFIDIUS:
Your heaviest censure.
First Lord:
Bear from hence his body,
First Lord:
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
First Lord:
As the most noble corse that ever herald
First Lord:
Did follow to his urn.
Second Lord:
His own impatience
Second Lord:
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Second Lord:
Let's make the best of it.
AUFIDIUS:
My rage is gone,
AUFIDIUS:
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
AUFIDIUS:
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers, I'll be one.
AUFIDIUS:
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully
AUFIDIUS:
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
AUFIDIUS:
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
AUFIDIUS:
Which to this hour bewail the injury,
AUFIDIUS:
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
AUFIDIUS:
Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS. A dead march sounded
