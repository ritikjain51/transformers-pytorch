LUCENTIO:
ACT I
LUCENTIO:
SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise
LUCENTIO:
of thunder and lightning heard.
LUCENTIO:
Enter a Master and a Boatswain
Master:
Boatswain!
Boatswain:
Here, master: what cheer?
Master:
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
Master:
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
Master:
Exit
Master:
Enter Mariners
Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
Boatswain:
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
Boatswain:
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
Boatswain:
if room enough!
Boatswain:
Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others
ALONSO:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
ALONSO:
Play the men.
Boatswain:
I pray now, keep below.
ANTONIO:
Where is the master, boatswain?
Boatswain:
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
Boatswain:
cabins: you do assist the storm.
GONZALO:
Nay, good, be patient.
Boatswain:
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
Boatswain:
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
GONZALO:
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself. You are a
Boatswain:
counsellor, if you can command these elements to
Boatswain:
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
Boatswain:
not hand a rope more, use your authority: if you
Boatswain:
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
Boatswain:
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
Boatswain:
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
Boatswain:
of our way, I say.
Boatswain:
Exit
GONZALO:
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
GONZALO:
hath no drowning mark upon him, his complexion is
GONZALO:
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
GONZALO:
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
GONZALO:
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
GONZALO:
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
GONZALO:
Exeunt
GONZALO:
Re-enter Boatswain
Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
Boatswain:
her to try with main-course.
Boatswain:
A cry within
Boatswain:
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
Boatswain:
the weather or our office.
Boatswain:
Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO
Boatswain:
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
Boatswain:
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
SEBASTIAN:
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
SEBASTIAN:
incharitable dog!
Boatswain:
Work you then.
ANTONIO:
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
ANTONIO:
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
GONZALO:
I'll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were
GONZALO:
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
GONZALO:
unstanched wench.
Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
Boatswain:
sea again, lay her off.
Boatswain:
Enter Mariners wet
Mariners:
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?
GONZALO:
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
GONZALO:
For our case is as theirs.
SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience.
ANTONIO:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards
ANTONIO:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
ANTONIO:
The washing of ten tides!
GONZALO:
He'll be hang'd yet,
GONZALO:
Though every drop of water swear against it
GONZALO:
And gape at widest to glut him.
GONZALO:
A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--  'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and  children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'
ANTONIO:
Let's all sink with the king.
SEBASTIAN:
Let's take leave of him.
SEBASTIAN:
Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
GONZALO:
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
GONZALO:
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
GONZALO:
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
GONZALO:
die a dry death.
GONZALO:
Exeunt
GONZALO:
SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
GONZALO:
Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA
MIRANDA:
If by your art, my dearest father, you have
MIRANDA:
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
MIRANDA:
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
MIRANDA:
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
MIRANDA:
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
MIRANDA:
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
MIRANDA:
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
MIRANDA:
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
MIRANDA:
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
MIRANDA:
Had I been any god of power, I would
MIRANDA:
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
MIRANDA:
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
MIRANDA:
The fraughting souls within her.
PROSPERO:
Be collected
PROSPERO:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
PROSPERO:
There's no harm done.
MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!
PROSPERO:
No harm.
PROSPERO:
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
PROSPERO:
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
PROSPERO:
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
PROSPERO:
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
PROSPERO:
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
PROSPERO:
And thy no greater father.
MIRANDA:
More to know
MIRANDA:
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
PROSPERO:
'Tis time
PROSPERO:
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
PROSPERO:
And pluck my magic garment from me. So
PROSPERO:
Lays down his mantle
PROSPERO:
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort.
PROSPERO:
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
PROSPERO:
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
PROSPERO:
I have with such provision in mine art
PROSPERO:
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
PROSPERO:
No, not so much perdition as an hair
PROSPERO:
Betid to any creature in the vessel
PROSPERO:
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down,
PROSPERO:
For thou must now know farther.
MIRANDA:
You have often
MIRANDA:
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
MIRANDA:
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
MIRANDA:
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
PROSPERO:
The hour's now come,
PROSPERO:
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear,
PROSPERO:
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
PROSPERO:
A time before we came unto this cell?
PROSPERO:
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
PROSPERO:
Out three years old.
MIRANDA:
Certainly, sir, I can.
PROSPERO:
By what? by any other house or person?
PROSPERO:
Of any thing the image tell me that
PROSPERO:
Hath kept with thy remembrance.
MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
MIRANDA:
And rather like a dream than an assurance
MIRANDA:
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
MIRANDA:
Four or five women once that tended me?
PROSPERO:
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
PROSPERO:
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
PROSPERO:
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
PROSPERO:
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
PROSPERO:
How thou camest here thou mayst.
MIRANDA:
But that I do not.
PROSPERO:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
PROSPERO:
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
PROSPERO:
A prince of power.
MIRANDA:
Sir, are not you my father?
PROSPERO:
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
PROSPERO:
She said thou wast my daughter, and thy father
PROSPERO:
Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir
PROSPERO:
And princess no worse issued.
MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
MIRANDA:
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
MIRANDA:
Or blessed was't we did?
PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl
PROSPERO:
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
PROSPERO:
But blessedly holp hither.
MIRANDA:
O, my heart bleeds
MIRANDA:
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
MIRANDA:
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
PROSPERO:
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
PROSPERO:
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
PROSPERO:
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
PROSPERO:
Of all the world I loved and to him put
PROSPERO:
The manage of my state, as at that time
PROSPERO:
Through all the signories it was the first
PROSPERO:
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
PROSPERO:
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
PROSPERO:
Without a parallel, those being all my study,
PROSPERO:
The government I cast upon my brother
PROSPERO:
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
PROSPERO:
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
PROSPERO:
Dost thou attend me?
MIRANDA:
Sir, most heedfully.
PROSPERO:
Being once perfected how to grant suits,
PROSPERO:
How to deny them, who to advance and who
PROSPERO:
To trash for over-topping, new created
PROSPERO:
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
PROSPERO:
Or else new form'd 'em, having both the key
PROSPERO:
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
PROSPERO:
To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was
PROSPERO:
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
PROSPERO:
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
MIRANDA:
O, good sir, I do.
PROSPERO:
I pray thee, mark me.
PROSPERO:
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
PROSPERO:
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
PROSPERO:
With that which, but by being so retired,
PROSPERO:
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
PROSPERO:
Awaked an evil nature, and my trust,
PROSPERO:
Like a good parent, did beget of him
PROSPERO:
A falsehood in its contrary as great
PROSPERO:
As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,
PROSPERO:
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
PROSPERO:
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
PROSPERO:
But what my power might else exact, like one
PROSPERO:
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
PROSPERO:
Made such a sinner of his memory,
PROSPERO:
To credit his own lie, he did believe
PROSPERO:
He was indeed the duke, out o' the substitution
PROSPERO:
And executing the outward face of royalty,
PROSPERO:
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
PROSPERO:
Dost thou hear?
MIRANDA:
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
PROSPERO:
To have no screen between this part he play'd
PROSPERO:
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
PROSPERO:
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
PROSPERO:
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
PROSPERO:
He thinks me now incapable, confederates--
PROSPERO:
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
PROSPERO:
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
PROSPERO:
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
PROSPERO:
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
PROSPERO:
To most ignoble stooping.
MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
PROSPERO:
Mark his condition and the event, then tell me
PROSPERO:
If this might be a brother.
MIRANDA:
I should sin
MIRANDA:
To think but nobly of my grandmother
MIRANDA:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
PROSPERO:
Now the condition.
PROSPERO:
The King of Naples, being an enemy
PROSPERO:
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit,
PROSPERO:
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
PROSPERO:
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
PROSPERO:
Should presently extirpate me and mine
PROSPERO:
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
PROSPERO:
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
PROSPERO:
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
PROSPERO:
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
PROSPERO:
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
PROSPERO:
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
PROSPERO:
Me and thy crying self.
MIRANDA:
Alack, for pity!
MIRANDA:
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
MIRANDA:
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
MIRANDA:
That wrings mine eyes to't.
PROSPERO:
Hear a little further
PROSPERO:
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
PROSPERO:
Which now's upon's, without the which this story
PROSPERO:
Were most impertinent.
MIRANDA:
Wherefore did they not
MIRANDA:
That hour destroy us?
PROSPERO:
Well demanded, wench
PROSPERO:
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
PROSPERO:
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
PROSPERO:
A mark so bloody on the business, but
PROSPERO:
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
PROSPERO:
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
PROSPERO:
Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared
PROSPERO:
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
PROSPERO:
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast, the very rats
PROSPERO:
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
PROSPERO:
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
PROSPERO:
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
PROSPERO:
Did us but loving wrong.
MIRANDA:
Alack, what trouble
MIRANDA:
Was I then to you!
PROSPERO:
O, a cherubim
PROSPERO:
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
PROSPERO:
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
PROSPERO:
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
PROSPERO:
Under my burthen groan'd, which raised in me
PROSPERO:
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
PROSPERO:
Against what should ensue.
MIRANDA:
How came we ashore?
PROSPERO:
By Providence divine.
PROSPERO:
Some food we had and some fresh water that
PROSPERO:
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
PROSPERO:
Out of his charity, being then appointed
PROSPERO:
Master of this design, did give us, with
PROSPERO:
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
PROSPERO:
Which since have steaded much, so, of his gentleness,
PROSPERO:
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
PROSPERO:
From mine own library with volumes that
PROSPERO:
I prize above my dukedom.
MIRANDA:
Would I might
MIRANDA:
But ever see that man!
PROSPERO:
Now I arise
PROSPERO:
Resumes his mantle
PROSPERO:
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
PROSPERO:
Here in this island we arrived, and here
PROSPERO:
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
PROSPERO:
Than other princesses can that have more time
PROSPERO:
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
MIRANDA:
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
MIRANDA:
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
MIRANDA:
For raising this sea-storm?
PROSPERO:
Know thus far forth.
PROSPERO:
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
PROSPERO:
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
PROSPERO:
Brought to this shore, and by my prescience
PROSPERO:
I find my zenith doth depend upon
PROSPERO:
A most auspicious star, whose influence
PROSPERO:
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
PROSPERO:
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions
PROSPERO:
Thou art inclined to sleep, 'tis a good dulness,
PROSPERO:
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
PROSPERO:
MIRANDA sleeps
PROSPERO:
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
PROSPERO:
Approach, my Ariel, come.
PROSPERO:
Enter ARIEL
ARIEL:
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
ARIEL:
To answer thy best pleasure, be't to fly,
ARIEL:
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
ARIEL:
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
ARIEL:
Ariel and all his quality.
PROSPERO:
Hast thou, spirit,
PROSPERO:
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
ARIEL:
To every article.
ARIEL:
I boarded the king's ship, now on the beak,
ARIEL:
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
ARIEL:
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
ARIEL:
And burn in many places, on the topmast,
ARIEL:
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
ARIEL:
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
ARIEL:
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
ARIEL:
And sight-outrunning were not, the fire and cracks
ARIEL:
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
ARIEL:
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
ARIEL:
Yea, his dread trident shake.
PROSPERO:
My brave spirit!
PROSPERO:
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
PROSPERO:
Would not infect his reason?
ARIEL:
Not a soul
ARIEL:
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
ARIEL:
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
ARIEL:
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
ARIEL:
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
ARIEL:
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
ARIEL:
Was the first man that leap'd, cried, 'Hell is empty
ARIEL:
And all the devils are here.'
PROSPERO:
Why that's my spirit!
PROSPERO:
But was not this nigh shore?
ARIEL:
Close by, my master.
PROSPERO:
But are they, Ariel, safe?
ARIEL:
Not a hair perish'd,
ARIEL:
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
ARIEL:
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
ARIEL:
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
ARIEL:
The king's son have I landed by himself,
ARIEL:
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
ARIEL:
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
ARIEL:
His arms in this sad knot.
PROSPERO:
Of the king's ship
PROSPERO:
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
PROSPERO:
And all the rest o' the fleet.
ARIEL:
Safely in harbour
ARIEL:
Is the king's ship, in the deep nook, where once
ARIEL:
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
ARIEL:
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid
ARIEL:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd,
ARIEL:
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
ARIEL:
I have left asleep, and for the rest o' the fleet
ARIEL:
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
ARIEL:
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
ARIEL:
Bound sadly home for Naples,
ARIEL:
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
ARIEL:
And his great person perish.
PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge
PROSPERO:
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
PROSPERO:
What is the time o' the day?
ARIEL:
Past the mid season.
PROSPERO:
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
PROSPERO:
Must by us both be spent most preciously.
ARIEL:
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
ARIEL:
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
ARIEL:
Which is not yet perform'd me.
PROSPERO:
How now? moody?
PROSPERO:
What is't thou canst demand?
ARIEL:
My liberty.
PROSPERO:
Before the time be out? no more!
ARIEL:
I prithee,
ARIEL:
Remember I have done thee worthy service,
ARIEL:
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
ARIEL:
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
ARIEL:
To bate me a full year.
PROSPERO:
Dost thou forget
PROSPERO:
From what a torment I did free thee?
ARIEL:
No.
PROSPERO:
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
PROSPERO:
Of the salt deep,
PROSPERO:
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
PROSPERO:
To do me business in the veins o' the earth
PROSPERO:
When it is baked with frost.
ARIEL:
I do not, sir.
PROSPERO:
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
PROSPERO:
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
PROSPERO:
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
ARIEL:
No, sir.
PROSPERO:
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak, tell me.
ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.
PROSPERO:
O, was she so? I must
PROSPERO:
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
PROSPERO:
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
PROSPERO:
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
PROSPERO:
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
PROSPERO:
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
PROSPERO:
They would not take her life. Is not this true?
ARIEL:
Ay, sir.
PROSPERO:
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
PROSPERO:
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
PROSPERO:
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant,
PROSPERO:
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
PROSPERO:
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
PROSPERO:
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
PROSPERO:
By help of her more potent ministers
PROSPERO:
And in her most unmitigable rage,
PROSPERO:
Into a cloven pine, within which rift
PROSPERO:
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
PROSPERO:
A dozen years, within which space she died
PROSPERO:
And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
PROSPERO:
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
PROSPERO:
Save for the son that she did litter here,
PROSPERO:
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
PROSPERO:
A human shape.
ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son.
PROSPERO:
Dull thing, I say so, he, that Caliban
PROSPERO:
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
PROSPERO:
What torment I did find thee in, thy groans
PROSPERO:
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
PROSPERO:
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
PROSPERO:
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
PROSPERO:
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
PROSPERO:
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
PROSPERO:
The pine and let thee out.
ARIEL:
I thank thee, master.
PROSPERO:
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
PROSPERO:
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
PROSPERO:
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
ARIEL:
Pardon, master,
ARIEL:
I will be correspondent to command
ARIEL:
And do my spiriting gently.
PROSPERO:
Do so, and after two days
PROSPERO:
I will discharge thee.
ARIEL:
That's my noble master!
ARIEL:
What shall I do? say what, what shall I do?
PROSPERO:
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
PROSPERO:
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
PROSPERO:
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
PROSPERO:
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
PROSPERO:
Exit ARIEL
PROSPERO:
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well, Awake!
MIRANDA:
The strangeness of your story put
MIRANDA:
Heaviness in me.
PROSPERO:
Shake it off. Come on,
PROSPERO:
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
PROSPERO:
Yields us kind answer.
MIRANDA:
'Tis a villain, sir,
MIRANDA:
I do not love to look on.
PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
PROSPERO:
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
PROSPERO:
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
PROSPERO:
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
PROSPERO:
Thou earth, thou! speak.
CALIBAN:
[Within]  There's wood enough within.
PROSPERO:
Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee
PROSPERO:
Come, thou tortoise! when?
PROSPERO:
Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph
PROSPERO:
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
PROSPERO:
Hark in thine ear.
ARIEL:
My lord it shall be done.
ARIEL:
Exit
PROSPERO:
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
PROSPERO:
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
PROSPERO:
Enter CALIBAN
CALIBAN:
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
CALIBAN:
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
CALIBAN:
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
CALIBAN:
And blister you all o'er!
PROSPERO:
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
PROSPERO:
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up, urchins
PROSPERO:
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
PROSPERO:
All exercise on thee, thou shalt be pinch'd
PROSPERO:
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
PROSPERO:
Than bees that made 'em.
CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
CALIBAN:
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
CALIBAN:
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
CALIBAN:
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
CALIBAN:
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
CALIBAN:
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
CALIBAN:
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
CALIBAN:
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
CALIBAN:
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile
CALIBAN:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
CALIBAN:
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
CALIBAN:
For I am all the subjects that you have,
CALIBAN:
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
CALIBAN:
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
CALIBAN:
The rest o' the island.
PROSPERO:
Thou most lying slave,
PROSPERO:
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
PROSPERO:
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
PROSPERO:
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
PROSPERO:
The honour of my child.
CALIBAN:
O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
CALIBAN:
Thou didst prevent me, I had peopled else
CALIBAN:
This isle with Calibans.
PROSPERO:
Abhorred slave,
PROSPERO:
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
PROSPERO:
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
PROSPERO:
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
PROSPERO:
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
PROSPERO:
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
PROSPERO:
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
PROSPERO:
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
PROSPERO:
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
PROSPERO:
good natures
PROSPERO:
Could not abide to be with, therefore wast thou
PROSPERO:
Deservedly confined into this rock,
PROSPERO:
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
CALIBAN:
You taught me language, and my profit on't
CALIBAN:
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
CALIBAN:
For learning me your language!
PROSPERO:
Hag-seed, hence!
PROSPERO:
Fetch us in fuel, and be quick, thou'rt best,
PROSPERO:
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
PROSPERO:
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
PROSPERO:
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
PROSPERO:
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
PROSPERO:
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
CALIBAN:
No, pray thee.
CALIBAN:
Aside
CALIBAN:
I must obey: his art is of such power,
CALIBAN:
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
CALIBAN:
and make a vassal of him.
PROSPERO:
So, slave, hence!
PROSPERO:
Exit CALIBAN
PROSPERO:
Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing, FERDINAND following
PROSPERO:
ARIEL'S song.
PROSPERO:
Come unto these yellow sands,
PROSPERO:
And then take hands
PROSPERO:
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
PROSPERO:
The wild waves whist,
PROSPERO:
Foot it featly here and there,
PROSPERO:
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
PROSPERO:
Hark, hark!
PROSPERO:
Burthen [dispersedly, within
PROSPERO:
The watch-dogs bark!
PROSPERO:
Burthen Bow-wow
PROSPERO:
Hark, hark! I hear
PROSPERO:
The strain of strutting chanticleer
PROSPERO:
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
FERDINAND:
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
FERDINAND:
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
FERDINAND:
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
FERDINAND:
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
FERDINAND:
This music crept by me upon the waters,
FERDINAND:
Allaying both their fury and my passion
FERDINAND:
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
FERDINAND:
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
FERDINAND:
No, it begins again.
FERDINAND:
ARIEL sings
FERDINAND:
Full fathom five thy father lies,
FERDINAND:
Of his bones are coral made,
FERDINAND:
Those are pearls that were his eyes
FERDINAND:
Nothing of him that doth fade
FERDINAND:
But doth suffer a sea-change
FERDINAND:
Into something rich and strange.
FERDINAND:
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
FERDINAND:
Burthen Ding-dong
FERDINAND:
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.
FERDINAND:
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
FERDINAND:
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
FERDINAND:
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
PROSPERO:
And say what thou seest yond.
MIRANDA:
What is't? a spirit?
MIRANDA:
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
MIRANDA:
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
PROSPERO:
No, wench, it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
PROSPERO:
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
PROSPERO:
Was in the wreck, and, but he's something stain'd
PROSPERO:
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
PROSPERO:
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
PROSPERO:
And strays about to find 'em.
MIRANDA:
I might call him
MIRANDA:
A thing divine, for nothing natural
MIRANDA:
I ever saw so noble.
PROSPERO:
[Aside] It goes on, I see,
PROSPERO:
As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
PROSPERO:
Within two days for this.
FERDINAND:
Most sure, the goddess
FERDINAND:
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
FERDINAND:
May know if you remain upon this island,
FERDINAND:
And that you will some good instruction give
FERDINAND:
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
FERDINAND:
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
FERDINAND:
If you be maid or no?
MIRANDA:
No wonder, sir,
MIRANDA:
But certainly a maid.
FERDINAND:
My language! heavens!
FERDINAND:
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
FERDINAND:
Were I but where 'tis spoken.
PROSPERO:
How? the best?
PROSPERO:
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
FERDINAND:
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me,
FERDINAND:
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
FERDINAND:
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
FERDINAND:
The king my father wreck'd.
MIRANDA:
Alack, for mercy!
FERDINAND:
Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan
FERDINAND:
And his brave son being twain.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]	The Duke of Milan
PROSPERO:
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
PROSPERO:
If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
PROSPERO:
They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
PROSPERO:
I'll set thee free for this.
PROSPERO:
To FERDINAND
PROSPERO:
A word, good sir,
PROSPERO:
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
MIRANDA:
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
MIRANDA:
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
MIRANDA:
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
MIRANDA:
To be inclined my way!
FERDINAND:
O, if a virgin,
FERDINAND:
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
FERDINAND:
The queen of Naples.
PROSPERO:
Soft, sir! one word more.
PROSPERO:
Aside
PROSPERO:
They are both in either's powers, but this swift business
PROSPERO:
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
PROSPERO:
Make the prize light.
PROSPERO:
To FERDINAND
PROSPERO:
One word more, I charge thee
PROSPERO:
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
PROSPERO:
The name thou owest not, and hast put thyself
PROSPERO:
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
PROSPERO:
From me, the lord on't.
FERDINAND:
No, as I am a man.
MIRANDA:
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple
MIRANDA:
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
MIRANDA:
Good things will strive to dwell with't.
PROSPERO:
Follow me.
PROSPERO:
Speak not you for him, he's a traitor. Come,
PROSPERO:
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together
PROSPERO:
Sea-water shalt thou drink, thy food shall be
PROSPERO:
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
PROSPERO:
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
FERDINAND:
No,
FERDINAND:
I will resist such entertainment till
FERDINAND:
Mine enemy has more power.
FERDINAND:
Draws, and is charmed from moving
MIRANDA:
O dear father,
MIRANDA:
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
MIRANDA:
He's gentle and not fearful.
PROSPERO:
What? I say,
PROSPERO:
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor,
PROSPERO:
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
PROSPERO:
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
PROSPERO:
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
PROSPERO:
And make thy weapon drop.
MIRANDA:
Beseech you, father.
PROSPERO:
Hence! hang not on my garments.
MIRANDA:
Sir, have pity,
MIRANDA:
I'll be his surety.
PROSPERO:
Silence! one word more
PROSPERO:
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
PROSPERO:
An advocate for an imposter! hush!
PROSPERO:
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
PROSPERO:
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
PROSPERO:
To the most of men this is a Caliban
PROSPERO:
And they to him are angels.
MIRANDA:
My affections
MIRANDA:
Are then most humble, I have no ambition
MIRANDA:
To see a goodlier man.
PROSPERO:
Come on, obey
PROSPERO:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
PROSPERO:
And have no vigour in them.
FERDINAND:
So they are,
FERDINAND:
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
FERDINAND:
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
FERDINAND:
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
FERDINAND:
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
FERDINAND:
Might I but through my prison once a day
FERDINAND:
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
FERDINAND:
Let liberty make use of, space enough
FERDINAND:
Have I in such a prison.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]                It works.
PROSPERO:
To FERDINAND
PROSPERO:
Come on.
PROSPERO:
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
PROSPERO:
To FERDINAND
PROSPERO:
Follow me.
PROSPERO:
To ARIEL
PROSPERO:
Hark what thou else shalt do me.
MIRANDA:
Be of comfort,
MIRANDA:
My father's of a better nature, sir,
MIRANDA:
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
MIRANDA:
Which now came from him.
PROSPERO:
Thou shalt be free
PROSPERO:
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
PROSPERO:
All points of my command.
ARIEL:
To the syllable.
PROSPERO:
Come, follow. Speak not for him.
PROSPERO:
Exeunt
PROSPERO:
ACT II
PROSPERO:
SCENE I. Another part of the island.
PROSPERO:
Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others
GONZALO:
Beseech you, sir, be merry, you have cause,
GONZALO:
So have we all, of joy, for our escape
GONZALO:
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
GONZALO:
Is common, every day some sailor's wife,
GONZALO:
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
GONZALO:
Have just our theme of woe, but for the miracle,
GONZALO:
I mean our preservation, few in millions
GONZALO:
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
GONZALO:
Our sorrow with our comfort.
ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.
SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.
ANTONIO:
The visitor will not give him o'er so.
SEBASTIAN:
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit,
SEBASTIAN:
by and by it will strike.
GONZALO:
Sir,--
SEBASTIAN:
One: tell.
GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
GONZALO:
Comes to the entertainer--
SEBASTIAN:
A dollar.
GONZALO:
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
GONZALO:
have spoken truer than you purposed.
SEBASTIAN:
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
GONZALO:
Therefore, my lord,--
ANTONIO:
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
ALONSO:
I prithee, spare.
GONZALO:
Well, I have done: but yet,--
SEBASTIAN:
He will be talking.
ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
ANTONIO:
wager, first begins to crow?
SEBASTIAN:
The old cock.
ANTONIO:
The cockerel.
SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?
ANTONIO:
A laughter.
SEBASTIAN:
A match!
ADRIAN:
Though this island seem to be desert,--
SEBASTIAN:
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.
ADRIAN:
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
SEBASTIAN:
Yet,--
ADRIAN:
Yet,--
ANTONIO:
He could not miss't.
ADRIAN:
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
ADRIAN:
temperance.
ANTONIO:
Temperance was a delicate wench.
SEBASTIAN:
Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered.
ADRIAN:
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
SEBASTIAN:
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
ANTONIO:
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
GONZALO:
Here is everything advantageous to life.
ANTONIO:
True, save means to live.
SEBASTIAN:
Of that there's none, or little.
GONZALO:
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
ANTONIO:
The ground indeed is tawny.
SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of green in't.
ANTONIO:
He misses not much.
SEBASTIAN:
No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.
GONZALO:
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
GONZALO:
beyond credit,--
SEBASTIAN:
As many vouched rarities are.
GONZALO:
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
GONZALO:
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
GONZALO:
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
GONZALO:
salt water.
ANTONIO:
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
ANTONIO:
say he lies?
SEBASTIAN:
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report
GONZALO:
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
GONZALO:
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
GONZALO:
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
SEBASTIAN:
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
ADRIAN:
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
ADRIAN:
their queen.
GONZALO:
Not since widow Dido's time.
ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
ANTONIO:
widow Dido!
SEBASTIAN:
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
SEBASTIAN:
how you take it!
ADRIAN:
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that
ADRIAN:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
GONZALO:
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
ADRIAN:
Carthage?
GONZALO:
I assure you, Carthage.
SEBASTIAN:
His word is more than the miraculous harp, he hath
SEBASTIAN:
raised the wall and houses too.
ANTONIO:
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
SEBASTIAN:
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
SEBASTIAN:
and give it his son for an apple.
ANTONIO:
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
ANTONIO:
forth more islands.
GONZALO:
Ay.
ANTONIO:
Why, in good time.
GONZALO:
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
GONZALO:
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
GONZALO:
of your daughter, who is now queen.
ANTONIO:
And the rarest that e'er came there.
SEBASTIAN:
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
ANTONIO:
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
GONZALO:
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
GONZALO:
wore it? I mean, in a sort.
ANTONIO:
That sort was well fished for.
GONZALO:
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
ALONSO:
You cram these words into mine ears against
ALONSO:
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
ALONSO:
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
ALONSO:
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
ALONSO:
Who is so far from Italy removed
ALONSO:
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
ALONSO:
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
ALONSO:
Hath made his meal on thee?
FRANCISCO:
Sir, he may live
FRANCISCO:
I saw him beat the surges under him,
FRANCISCO:
And ride upon their backs, he trod the water,
FRANCISCO:
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
FRANCISCO:
The surge most swoln that met him, his bold head
FRANCISCO:
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
FRANCISCO:
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
FRANCISCO:
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
FRANCISCO:
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
FRANCISCO:
He came alive to land.
ALONSO:
No, no, he's gone.
SEBASTIAN:
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
SEBASTIAN:
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
SEBASTIAN:
But rather lose her to an African,
SEBASTIAN:
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
SEBASTIAN:
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.
SEBASTIAN:
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
SEBASTIAN:
By all of us, and the fair soul herself
SEBASTIAN:
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
SEBASTIAN:
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
SEBASTIAN:
son,
SEBASTIAN:
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
SEBASTIAN:
More widows in them of this business' making
SEBASTIAN:
Than we bring men to comfort them
SEBASTIAN:
The fault's your own.
ALONSO:
So is the dear'st o' the loss.
GONZALO:
My lord Sebastian,
GONZALO:
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
GONZALO:
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
GONZALO:
When you should bring the plaster.
SEBASTIAN:
Very well.
ANTONIO:
And most chirurgeonly.
GONZALO:
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
GONZALO:
When you are cloudy.
SEBASTIAN:
Foul weather?
ANTONIO:
Very foul.
GONZALO:
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
ANTONIO:
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
SEBASTIAN:
Or docks, or mallows.
GONZALO:
And were the king on't, what would I do?
SEBASTIAN:
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
GONZALO:
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
GONZALO:
Execute all things, for no kind of traffic
GONZALO:
Would I admit, no name of magistrate,
GONZALO:
Letters should not be known, riches, poverty,
GONZALO:
And use of service, none, contract, succession,
GONZALO:
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none,
GONZALO:
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil,
GONZALO:
No occupation, all men idle, all,
GONZALO:
And women too, but innocent and pure,
GONZALO:
No sovereignty,--
SEBASTIAN:
Yet he would be king on't.
ANTONIO:
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
ANTONIO:
beginning.
GONZALO:
All things in common nature should produce
GONZALO:
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
GONZALO:
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
GONZALO:
Would I not have, but nature should bring forth,
GONZALO:
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
GONZALO:
To feed my innocent people.
SEBASTIAN:
No marrying 'mong his subjects?
ANTONIO:
None, man, all idle: whores and knaves.
GONZALO:
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
GONZALO:
To excel the golden age.
SEBASTIAN:
God save his majesty!
ANTONIO:
Long live Gonzalo!
GONZALO:
And,--do you mark me, sir?
ALONSO:
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
GONZALO:
I do well believe your highness, and
GONZALO:
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
GONZALO:
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
GONZALO:
they always use to laugh at nothing.
ANTONIO:
'Twas you we laughed at.
GONZALO:
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
GONZALO:
to you: so you may continue and laugh at
GONZALO:
nothing still.
ANTONIO:
What a blow was there given!
SEBASTIAN:
An it had not fallen flat-long.
GONZALO:
You are gentlemen of brave metal, you would lift
GONZALO:
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
GONZALO:
in it five weeks without changing.
GONZALO:
Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music
SEBASTIAN:
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
ANTONIO:
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
GONZALO:
No, I warrant you, I will not adventure
GONZALO:
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
GONZALO:
me asleep, for I am very heavy?
ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear us.
ANTONIO:
All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO
ALONSO:
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
ALONSO:
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
ALONSO:
They are inclined to do so.
SEBASTIAN:
Please you, sir,
SEBASTIAN:
Do not omit the heavy offer of it
SEBASTIAN:
It seldom visits sorrow, when it doth,
SEBASTIAN:
It is a comforter.
ANTONIO:
We two, my lord,
ANTONIO:
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
ANTONIO:
And watch your safety.
ALONSO:
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
ALONSO:
ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL
SEBASTIAN:
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' the climate.
SEBASTIAN:
Why
SEBASTIAN:
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
SEBASTIAN:
Myself disposed to sleep.
ANTONIO:
Nor I, my spirits are nimble.
ANTONIO:
They fell together all, as by consent,
ANTONIO:
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
ANTONIO:
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
ANTONIO:
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
ANTONIO:
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
ANTONIO:
My strong imagination sees a crown
ANTONIO:
Dropping upon thy head.
SEBASTIAN:
What, art thou waking?
ANTONIO:
Do you not hear me speak?
SEBASTIAN:
I do, and surely
SEBASTIAN:
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
SEBASTIAN:
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
SEBASTIAN:
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
SEBASTIAN:
With eyes wide open, standing, speaking, moving,
SEBASTIAN:
And yet so fast asleep.
ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian,
ANTONIO:
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather, wink'st
ANTONIO:
Whiles thou art waking.
SEBASTIAN:
Thou dost snore distinctly,
SEBASTIAN:
There's meaning in thy snores.
ANTONIO:
I am more serious than my custom: you
ANTONIO:
Must be so too, if heed me, which to do
ANTONIO:
Trebles thee o'er.
SEBASTIAN:
Well, I am standing water.
ANTONIO:
I'll teach you how to flow.
SEBASTIAN:
Do so: to ebb
SEBASTIAN:
Hereditary sloth instructs me.
ANTONIO:
O,
ANTONIO:
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
ANTONIO:
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
ANTONIO:
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
ANTONIO:
Most often do so near the bottom run
ANTONIO:
By their own fear or sloth.
SEBASTIAN:
Prithee, say on
SEBASTIAN:
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
SEBASTIAN:
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
SEBASTIAN:
Which throes thee much to yield.
ANTONIO:
Thus, sir
ANTONIO:
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
ANTONIO:
Who shall be of as little memory
ANTONIO:
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
ANTONIO:
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
ANTONIO:
Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
ANTONIO:
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
ANTONIO:
And he that sleeps here swims.
SEBASTIAN:
I have no hope
SEBASTIAN:
That he's undrown'd.
ANTONIO:
O, out of that 'no hope'
ANTONIO:
What great hope have you! no hope that way is
ANTONIO:
Another way so high a hope that even
ANTONIO:
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
ANTONIO:
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
ANTONIO:
That Ferdinand is drown'd?
SEBASTIAN:
He's gone.
ANTONIO:
Then, tell me,
ANTONIO:
Who's the next heir of Naples?
SEBASTIAN:
Claribel.
ANTONIO:
She that is queen of Tunis, she that dwells
ANTONIO:
Ten leagues beyond man's life, she that from Naples
ANTONIO:
Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
ANTONIO:
The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
ANTONIO:
Be rough and razorable, she that--from whom?
ANTONIO:
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
ANTONIO:
And by that destiny to perform an act
ANTONIO:
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
ANTONIO:
In yours and my discharge.
SEBASTIAN:
What stuff is this! how say you?
SEBASTIAN:
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis,
SEBASTIAN:
So is she heir of Naples, 'twixt which regions
SEBASTIAN:
There is some space.
ANTONIO:
A space whose every cubit
ANTONIO:
Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
ANTONIO:
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
ANTONIO:
And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
ANTONIO:
That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse
ANTONIO:
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
ANTONIO:
As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate
ANTONIO:
As amply and unnecessarily
ANTONIO:
As this Gonzalo, I myself could make
ANTONIO:
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
ANTONIO:
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
ANTONIO:
For your advancement! Do you understand me?
SEBASTIAN:
Methinks I do.
ANTONIO:
And how does your content
ANTONIO:
Tender your own good fortune?
SEBASTIAN:
I remember
SEBASTIAN:
You did supplant your brother Prospero.
ANTONIO:
True
ANTONIO:
And look how well my garments sit upon me,
ANTONIO:
Much feater than before: my brother's servants
ANTONIO:
Were then my fellows, now they are my men.
SEBASTIAN:
But, for your conscience?
ANTONIO:
Ay, sir, where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
ANTONIO:
'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
ANTONIO:
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
ANTONIO:
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
ANTONIO:
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
ANTONIO:
No better than the earth he lies upon,
ANTONIO:
If he were that which now he's like, that's dead,
ANTONIO:
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
ANTONIO:
Can lay to bed for ever, whiles you, doing thus,
ANTONIO:
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
ANTONIO:
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
ANTONIO:
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
ANTONIO:
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk,
ANTONIO:
They'll tell the clock to any business that
ANTONIO:
We say befits the hour.
SEBASTIAN:
Thy case, dear friend,
SEBASTIAN:
Shall be my precedent, as thou got'st Milan,
SEBASTIAN:
I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
SEBASTIAN:
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,
SEBASTIAN:
And I the king shall love thee.
ANTONIO:
Draw together,
ANTONIO:
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
ANTONIO:
To fall it on Gonzalo.
SEBASTIAN:
O, but one word.
SEBASTIAN:
They talk apart
SEBASTIAN:
Re-enter ARIEL, invisible
ARIEL:
My master through his art foresees the danger
ARIEL:
That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth--
ARIEL:
For else his project dies--to keep them living.
ARIEL:
Sings in GONZALO's ear
ARIEL:
While you here do snoring lie,
ARIEL:
Open-eyed conspiracy
ARIEL:
His time doth take.
ARIEL:
If of life you keep a care,
ARIEL:
Shake off slumber, and beware
ARIEL:
Awake, awake!
ANTONIO:
Then let us both be sudden.
GONZALO:
Now, good angels
GONZALO:
Preserve the king.
GONZALO:
They wake
ALONSO:
Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
ALONSO:
Wherefore this ghastly looking?
GONZALO:
What's the matter?
SEBASTIAN:
Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
SEBASTIAN:
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
SEBASTIAN:
Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
SEBASTIAN:
It struck mine ear most terribly.
ALONSO:
I heard nothing.
ANTONIO:
O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
ANTONIO:
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
ANTONIO:
Of a whole herd of lions.
ALONSO:
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
GONZALO:
Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
GONZALO:
And that a strange one too, which did awake me
GONZALO:
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
GONZALO:
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
GONZALO:
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
GONZALO:
Or that we quit this place, let's draw our weapons.
ALONSO:
Lead off this ground, and let's make further search
ALONSO:
For my poor son.
GONZALO:
Heavens keep him from these beasts!
GONZALO:
For he is, sure, i' the island.
ALONSO:
Lead away.
ARIEL:
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done
ARIEL:
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.
ARIEL:
Exeunt
ARIEL:
SCENE II. Another part of the island.
ARIEL:
Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard
CALIBAN:
All the infections that the sun sucks up
CALIBAN:
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
CALIBAN:
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
CALIBAN:
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
CALIBAN:
Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,
CALIBAN:
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
CALIBAN:
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em, but
CALIBAN:
For every trifle are they set upon me,
CALIBAN:
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
CALIBAN:
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
CALIBAN:
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
CALIBAN:
Their pricks at my footfall, sometime am I
CALIBAN:
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
CALIBAN:
Do hiss me into madness.
CALIBAN:
Enter TRINCULO
CALIBAN:
Lo, now, lo!
CALIBAN:
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
CALIBAN:
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat,
CALIBAN:
Perchance he will not mind me.
TRINCULO:
Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off
TRINCULO:
any weather at all, and another storm brewing,
TRINCULO:
I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
TRINCULO:
cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
TRINCULO:
bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
TRINCULO:
should thunder as it did before, I know not
TRINCULO:
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
TRINCULO:
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
TRINCULO:
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish
TRINCULO:
he smells like a fish, a very ancient and fish-
TRINCULO:
like smell, a kind of not of the newest Poor-
TRINCULO:
John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
TRINCULO:
as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
TRINCULO:
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
TRINCULO:
of silver: there would this monster make a
TRINCULO:
man, any strange beast there makes a man
TRINCULO:
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
TRINCULO:
beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
TRINCULO:
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
TRINCULO:
arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
TRINCULO:
my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish,
TRINCULO:
but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
TRINCULO:
thunderbolt.
TRINCULO:
Thunder
TRINCULO:
Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to
TRINCULO:
creep under his gaberdine, there is no other
TRINCULO:
shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
TRINCULO:
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
TRINCULO:
dregs of the storm be past.
TRINCULO:
Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand
STEPHANO:
I shall no more to sea, to sea,
STEPHANO:
Here shall I die ashore--
STEPHANO:
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
STEPHANO:
funeral: well, here's my comfort.
STEPHANO:
Drinks
STEPHANO:
Sings
STEPHANO:
The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
STEPHANO:
The gunner and his mate
STEPHANO:
Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
STEPHANO:
But none of us cared for Kate,
STEPHANO:
For she had a tongue with a tang,
STEPHANO:
Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
STEPHANO:
She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
STEPHANO:
Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch
STEPHANO:
Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
STEPHANO:
This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
STEPHANO:
Drinks
CALIBAN:
Do not torment me: Oh!
STEPHANO:
What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
STEPHANO:
tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
STEPHANO:
have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
STEPHANO:
four legs, for it hath been said, As proper a man as
STEPHANO:
ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground,
STEPHANO:
and it shall be said so again while Stephano
STEPHANO:
breathes at's nostrils.
CALIBAN:
The spirit torments me, Oh!
STEPHANO:
This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
STEPHANO:
hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
STEPHANO:
should he learn our language? I will give him some
STEPHANO:
relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
STEPHANO:
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a
STEPHANO:
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
CALIBAN:
Do not torment me, prithee, I'll bring my wood home faster.
STEPHANO:
He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
STEPHANO:
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
STEPHANO:
never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
STEPHANO:
fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
STEPHANO:
not take too much for him, he shall pay for him that
STEPHANO:
hath him, and that soundly.
CALIBAN:
Thou dost me yet but little hurt, thou wilt anon, I
CALIBAN:
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.
STEPHANO:
Come on your ways, open your mouth, here is that
STEPHANO:
which will give language to you, cat: open your
STEPHANO:
mouth, this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
STEPHANO:
and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend
STEPHANO:
open your chaps again.
TRINCULO:
I should know that voice: it should be--but he is
TRINCULO:
drowned, and these are devils: O defend me!
STEPHANO:
Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
STEPHANO:
His forward voice now is to speak well of his
STEPHANO:
friend, his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
STEPHANO:
and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
STEPHANO:
recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
STEPHANO:
will pour some in thy other mouth.
TRINCULO:
Stephano!
STEPHANO:
Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is
STEPHANO:
a devil, and no monster: I will leave him, I have no
STEPHANO:
long spoon.
TRINCULO:
Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and
TRINCULO:
speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy
TRINCULO:
good friend Trinculo.
STEPHANO:
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee
STEPHANO:
by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,
STEPHANO:
these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
STEPHANO:
camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
STEPHANO:
he vent Trinculos?
TRINCULO:
I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
TRINCULO:
art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
TRINCULO:
not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
TRINCULO:
under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
TRINCULO:
the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O
TRINCULO:
Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!
STEPHANO:
Prithee, do not turn me about, my stomach is not constant.
CALIBAN:
[Aside]  These be fine things, an if they be
CALIBAN:
not sprites.
CALIBAN:
That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
CALIBAN:
I will kneel to him.
STEPHANO:
How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
STEPHANO:
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
STEPHANO:
escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
STEPHANO:
heaved o'erboard, by this bottle, which I made of
STEPHANO:
the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
STEPHANO:
cast ashore.
CALIBAN:
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject,
CALIBAN:
for the liquor is not earthly.
STEPHANO:
Here, swear then how thou escapedst.
TRINCULO:
Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a
TRINCULO:
duck, I'll be sworn.
STEPHANO:
Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
STEPHANO:
duck, thou art made like a goose.
TRINCULO:
O Stephano. hast any more of this?
STEPHANO:
The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the
STEPHANO:
sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
STEPHANO:
how does thine ague?
CALIBAN:
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
STEPHANO:
Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'
STEPHANO:
the moon when time was.
CALIBAN:
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee
CALIBAN:
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
STEPHANO:
Come, swear to that, kiss the book: I will furnish
STEPHANO:
it anon with new contents swear.
TRINCULO:
By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
TRINCULO:
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
TRINCULO:
the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
TRINCULO:
drawn, monster, in good sooth!
CALIBAN:
I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island,
CALIBAN:
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.
TRINCULO:
By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
TRINCULO:
monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.
CALIBAN:
I'll kiss thy foot, I'll swear myself thy subject.
STEPHANO:
Come on then, down, and swear.
TRINCULO:
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
TRINCULO:
monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
TRINCULO:
heart to beat him,--
STEPHANO:
Come, kiss.
TRINCULO:
But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!
CALIBAN:
I'll show thee the best springs, I'll pluck thee berries,
CALIBAN:
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
CALIBAN:
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
CALIBAN:
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
CALIBAN:
Thou wondrous man.
TRINCULO:
A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a
TRINCULO:
Poor drunkard!
CALIBAN:
I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow,
CALIBAN:
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts,
CALIBAN:
Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
CALIBAN:
To snare the nimble marmoset, I'll bring thee
CALIBAN:
To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
CALIBAN:
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
STEPHANO:
I prithee now, lead the way without any more
STEPHANO:
talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company
STEPHANO:
else being drowned, we will inherit here: here,
STEPHANO:
bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by
STEPHANO:
and by again.
CALIBAN:
[Sings drunkenly]
CALIBAN:
Farewell master, farewell, farewell!
TRINCULO:
A howling monster: a drunken monster!
CALIBAN:
No more dams I'll make for fish
CALIBAN:
Nor fetch in firing
CALIBAN:
At requiring,
CALIBAN:
Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish
CALIBAN:
'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
CALIBAN:
Has a new master: get a new man.
CALIBAN:
Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
CALIBAN:
hey-day, freedom!
STEPHANO:
O brave monster! Lead the way.
STEPHANO:
Exeunt
STEPHANO:
ACT III
STEPHANO:
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S Cell.
STEPHANO:
Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log
FERDINAND:
There be some sports are painful, and their labour
FERDINAND:
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
FERDINAND:
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
FERDINAND:
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
FERDINAND:
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
FERDINAND:
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
FERDINAND:
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
FERDINAND:
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
FERDINAND:
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
FERDINAND:
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
FERDINAND:
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
FERDINAND:
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
FERDINAND:
Had never like executor. I forget
FERDINAND:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
FERDINAND:
Most busy lest, when I do it.
FERDINAND:
Enter MIRANDA, and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen
MIRANDA:
Alas, now, pray you,
MIRANDA:
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
MIRANDA:
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
MIRANDA:
Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
MIRANDA:
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
MIRANDA:
Is hard at study, pray now, rest yourself,
MIRANDA:
He's safe for these three hours.
FERDINAND:
O most dear mistress,
FERDINAND:
The sun will set before I shall discharge
FERDINAND:
What I must strive to do.
MIRANDA:
If you'll sit down,
MIRANDA:
I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that,
MIRANDA:
I'll carry it to the pile.
FERDINAND:
No, precious creature,
FERDINAND:
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
FERDINAND:
Than you should such dishonour undergo,
FERDINAND:
While I sit lazy by.
MIRANDA:
It would become me
MIRANDA:
As well as it does you: and I should do it
MIRANDA:
With much more ease, for my good will is to it,
MIRANDA:
And yours it is against.
PROSPERO:
Poor worm, thou art infected!
PROSPERO:
This visitation shows it.
MIRANDA:
You look wearily.
FERDINAND:
No, noble mistress,'tis fresh morning with me
FERDINAND:
When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
FERDINAND:
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
FERDINAND:
What is your name?
MIRANDA:
Miranda.--O my father,
MIRANDA:
I have broke your hest to say so!
FERDINAND:
Admired Miranda!
FERDINAND:
Indeed the top of admiration! worth
FERDINAND:
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
FERDINAND:
I have eyed with best regard and many a time
FERDINAND:
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
FERDINAND:
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
FERDINAND:
Have I liked several women, never any
FERDINAND:
With so fun soul, but some defect in her
FERDINAND:
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
FERDINAND:
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
FERDINAND:
So perfect and so peerless, are created
FERDINAND:
Of every creature's best!
MIRANDA:
I do not know
MIRANDA:
One of my sex, no woman's face remember,
MIRANDA:
Save, from my glass, mine own, nor have I seen
MIRANDA:
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
MIRANDA:
And my dear father: how features are abroad,
MIRANDA:
I am skilless of, but, by my modesty,
MIRANDA:
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
MIRANDA:
Any companion in the world but you,
MIRANDA:
Nor can imagination form a shape,
MIRANDA:
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
MIRANDA:
Something too wildly and my father's precepts
MIRANDA:
I therein do forget.
FERDINAND:
I am in my condition
FERDINAND:
A prince, Miranda, I do think, a king,
FERDINAND:
I would, not so!--and would no more endure
FERDINAND:
This wooden slavery than to suffer
FERDINAND:
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak
FERDINAND:
The very instant that I saw you, did
FERDINAND:
My heart fly to your service, there resides,
FERDINAND:
To make me slave to it, and for your sake
FERDINAND:
Am I this patient log--man.
MIRANDA:
Do you love me?
FERDINAND:
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
FERDINAND:
And crown what I profess with kind event
FERDINAND:
If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
FERDINAND:
What best is boded me to mischief! I
FERDINAND:
Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
FERDINAND:
Do love, prize, honour you.
MIRANDA:
I am a fool
MIRANDA:
To weep at what I am glad of.
PROSPERO:
Fair encounter
PROSPERO:
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
PROSPERO:
On that which breeds between 'em!
FERDINAND:
Wherefore weep you?
MIRANDA:
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
MIRANDA:
What I desire to give, and much less take
MIRANDA:
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,
MIRANDA:
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
MIRANDA:
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
MIRANDA:
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
MIRANDA:
I am your wife, if you will marry me,
MIRANDA:
If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
MIRANDA:
You may deny me, but I'll be your servant,
MIRANDA:
Whether you will or no.
FERDINAND:
My mistress, dearest,
FERDINAND:
And I thus humble ever.
MIRANDA:
My husband, then?
FERDINAND:
Ay, with a heart as willing
FERDINAND:
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
MIRANDA:
And mine, with my heart in't, and now farewell
MIRANDA:
Till half an hour hence.
FERDINAND:
A thousand thousand!
FERDINAND:
Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally
PROSPERO:
So glad of this as they I cannot be,
PROSPERO:
Who are surprised withal, but my rejoicing
PROSPERO:
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
PROSPERO:
For yet ere supper-time must I perform
PROSPERO:
Much business appertaining.
PROSPERO:
Exit
PROSPERO:
SCENE II. Another part of the island.
PROSPERO:
Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO
STEPHANO:
Tell not me, when the butt is out, we will drink
STEPHANO:
water, not a drop before: therefore bear up, and
STEPHANO:
board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.
TRINCULO:
Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
TRINCULO:
say there's but five upon this isle: we are three
TRINCULO:
of them, if th' other two be brained like us, the
TRINCULO:
state totters.
STEPHANO:
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
STEPHANO:
are almost set in thy head.
TRINCULO:
Where should they be set else? he were a brave
TRINCULO:
monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
STEPHANO:
My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack
STEPHANO:
for my part, the sea cannot drown me, I swam, ere I
STEPHANO:
could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
STEPHANO:
and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
STEPHANO:
monster, or my standard.
TRINCULO:
Your lieutenant, if you list, he's no standard.
STEPHANO:
We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
TRINCULO:
Nor go neither, but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
TRINCULO:
nothing neither.
STEPHANO:
Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
STEPHANO:
good moon-calf.
CALIBAN:
How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
CALIBAN:
I'll not serve him, he's not valiant.
TRINCULO:
Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to
TRINCULO:
justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
TRINCULO:
was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
TRINCULO:
sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
TRINCULO:
being but half a fish and half a monster?
CALIBAN:
Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?
TRINCULO:
'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!
CALIBAN:
Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.
STEPHANO:
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
STEPHANO:
prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's
STEPHANO:
my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
CALIBAN:
I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
CALIBAN:
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
STEPHANO:
Marry, will I	kneel and repeat it, I will stand,
STEPHANO:
and so shall Trinculo.
STEPHANO:
Enter ARIEL, invisible
CALIBAN:
As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a
CALIBAN:
sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
ARIEL:
Thou liest.
CALIBAN:
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my
CALIBAN:
valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.
STEPHANO:
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by
STEPHANO:
this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
TRINCULO:
Why, I said nothing.
STEPHANO:
Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
CALIBAN:
I say, by sorcery he got this isle,
CALIBAN:
From me he got it. if thy greatness will
CALIBAN:
Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
CALIBAN:
But this thing dare not,--
STEPHANO:
That's most certain.
CALIBAN:
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
STEPHANO:
How now shall this be compassed?
STEPHANO:
Canst thou bring me to the party?
CALIBAN:
Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
CALIBAN:
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.
ARIEL:
Thou liest, thou canst not.
CALIBAN:
What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
CALIBAN:
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
CALIBAN:
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
CALIBAN:
He shall drink nought but brine, for I'll not show him
CALIBAN:
Where the quick freshes are.
STEPHANO:
Trinculo, run into no further danger
STEPHANO:
interrupt the monster one word further, and,
STEPHANO:
by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors
STEPHANO:
and make a stock-fish of thee.
TRINCULO:
Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
TRINCULO:
off.
STEPHANO:
Didst thou not say he lied?
ARIEL:
Thou liest.
STEPHANO:
Do I so? take thou that.
STEPHANO:
Beats TRINCULO
STEPHANO:
As you like this, give me the lie another time.
TRINCULO:
I did not give the lie. Out o' your
TRINCULO:
wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
TRINCULO:
this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
TRINCULO:
your monster, and the devil take your fingers!
CALIBAN:
Ha, ha, ha!
STEPHANO:
Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
STEPHANO:
off.
CALIBAN:
Beat him enough: after a little time
CALIBAN:
I'll beat him too.
STEPHANO:
Stand farther. Come, proceed.
CALIBAN:
Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
CALIBAN:
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
CALIBAN:
Having first seized his books, or with a log
CALIBAN:
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
CALIBAN:
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
CALIBAN:
First to possess his books, for without them
CALIBAN:
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
CALIBAN:
One spirit to command: they all do hate him
CALIBAN:
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
CALIBAN:
He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
CALIBAN:
Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
CALIBAN:
And that most deeply to consider is
CALIBAN:
The beauty of his daughter, he himself
CALIBAN:
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
CALIBAN:
But only Sycorax my dam and she,
CALIBAN:
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
CALIBAN:
As great'st does least.
STEPHANO:
Is it so brave a lass?
CALIBAN:
Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant.
CALIBAN:
And bring thee forth brave brood.
STEPHANO:
Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
STEPHANO:
will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
STEPHANO:
Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
STEPHANO:
like the plot, Trinculo?
TRINCULO:
Excellent.
STEPHANO:
Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee, but,
STEPHANO:
while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
CALIBAN:
Within this half hour will he be asleep
CALIBAN:
Wilt thou destroy him then?
STEPHANO:
Ay, on mine honour.
ARIEL:
This will I tell my master.
CALIBAN:
Thou makest me merry, I am full of pleasure
CALIBAN:
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
CALIBAN:
You taught me but while-ere?
STEPHANO:
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
STEPHANO:
reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
STEPHANO:
Sings
STEPHANO:
Flout 'em and scout 'em
STEPHANO:
And scout 'em and flout 'em
STEPHANO:
Thought is free.
CALIBAN:
That's not the tune.
CALIBAN:
Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe
STEPHANO:
What is this same?
TRINCULO:
This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
TRINCULO:
of Nobody.
STEPHANO:
If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness
STEPHANO:
if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
TRINCULO:
O, forgive me my sins!
STEPHANO:
He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
CALIBAN:
Art thou afeard?
STEPHANO:
No, monster, not I.
CALIBAN:
Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises,
CALIBAN:
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
CALIBAN:
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
CALIBAN:
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
CALIBAN:
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
CALIBAN:
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
CALIBAN:
The clouds methought would open and show riches
CALIBAN:
Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
CALIBAN:
I cried to dream again.
STEPHANO:
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
STEPHANO:
have my music for nothing.
CALIBAN:
When Prospero is destroyed.
STEPHANO:
That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
TRINCULO:
The sound is going away, let's follow it, and
TRINCULO:
after do our work.
STEPHANO:
Lead, monster, we'll follow. I would I could see
STEPHANO:
this tabourer, he lays it on.
TRINCULO:
Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.
TRINCULO:
Exeunt
TRINCULO:
SCENE III. Another part of the island.
TRINCULO:
Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others
GONZALO:
By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir,
GONZALO:
My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
GONZALO:
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
GONZALO:
I needs must rest me.
ALONSO:
Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
ALONSO:
Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
ALONSO:
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
ALONSO:
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
ALONSO:
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
ALONSO:
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
ALONSO:
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
ANTONIO:
[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so
ANTONIO:
out of hope.
ANTONIO:
Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
ANTONIO:
That you resolved to effect.
SEBASTIAN:
[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage
SEBASTIAN:
Will we take throughly.
ANTONIO:
[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night,
ANTONIO:
For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
ANTONIO:
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
ANTONIO:
As when they are fresh.
SEBASTIAN:
[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more.
SEBASTIAN:
Solemn and strange music
ALONSO:
What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
GONZALO:
Marvellous sweet music!
GONZALO:
Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several  strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet,  they dance about it with gentle actions of  salutation, and, inviting the King,  and c. to eat, they depart
ALONSO:
Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
SEBASTIAN:
A living drollery. Now I will believe
SEBASTIAN:
That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
SEBASTIAN:
There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
SEBASTIAN:
At this hour reigning there.
ANTONIO:
I'll believe both,
ANTONIO:
And what does else want credit, come to me,
ANTONIO:
And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
ANTONIO:
lie,
ANTONIO:
Though fools at home condemn 'em.
GONZALO:
If in Naples
GONZALO:
I should report this now, would they believe me?
GONZALO:
If I should say, I saw such islanders--
GONZALO:
For, certes, these are people of the island--
GONZALO:
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
GONZALO:
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
GONZALO:
Our human generation you shall find
GONZALO:
Many, nay, almost any.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]              Honest lord,
PROSPERO:
Thou hast said well, for some of you there present
PROSPERO:
Are worse than devils.
ALONSO:
I cannot too much muse
ALONSO:
Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
ALONSO:
Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
ALONSO:
Of excellent dumb discourse.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]	Praise in departing.
FRANCISCO:
They vanish'd strangely.
SEBASTIAN:
No matter, since
SEBASTIAN:
They have left their viands behind, for we have stomachs.
SEBASTIAN:
Will't please you taste of what is here?
ALONSO:
Not I.
GONZALO:
Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
GONZALO:
Who would believe that there were mountaineers
GONZALO:
Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
GONZALO:
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
GONZALO:
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
GONZALO:
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
GONZALO:
Good warrant of.
ALONSO:
I will stand to and feed,
ALONSO:
Although my last: no matter, since I feel
ALONSO:
The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
ALONSO:
Stand to and do as we.
ALONSO:
Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a  harpy, claps his wings upon the table, and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes
ARIEL:
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
ARIEL:
That hath to instrument this lower world
ARIEL:
And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
ARIEL:
Hath caused to belch up you, and on this island
ARIEL:
Where man doth not inhabit, you 'mongst men
ARIEL:
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad,
ARIEL:
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
ARIEL:
Their proper selves.
ARIEL:
ALONSO, SEBASTIAN  and c. draw their swords
ARIEL:
You fools! I and my fellows
ARIEL:
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
ARIEL:
Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
ARIEL:
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
ARIEL:
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
ARIEL:
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
ARIEL:
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
ARIEL:
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
ARIEL:
And will not be uplifted. But remember--
ARIEL:
For that's my business to you--that you three
ARIEL:
From Milan did supplant good Prospero,
ARIEL:
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
ARIEL:
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
ARIEL:
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
ARIEL:
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
ARIEL:
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
ARIEL:
They have bereft, and do pronounce by me
ARIEL:
Lingering perdition, worse than any death
ARIEL:
Can be at once, shall step by step attend
ARIEL:
You and your ways, whose wraths to guard you from--
ARIEL:
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
ARIEL:
Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
ARIEL:
And a clear life ensuing.
ARIEL:
He vanishes in thunder, then, to soft music  enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table
PROSPERO:
Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
PROSPERO:
Perform'd, my Ariel, a grace it had, devouring
PROSPERO:
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
PROSPERO:
In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
PROSPERO:
And observation strange, my meaner ministers
PROSPERO:
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
PROSPERO:
And these mine enemies are all knit up
PROSPERO:
In their distractions, they now are in my power,
PROSPERO:
And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
PROSPERO:
Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
PROSPERO:
And his and mine loved darling.
PROSPERO:
Exit above
GONZALO:
I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
GONZALO:
In this strange stare?
ALONSO:
O, it is monstrous, monstrous
ALONSO:
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it,
ALONSO:
The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
ALONSO:
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
ALONSO:
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
ALONSO:
Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
ALONSO:
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
ALONSO:
And with him there lie mudded.
ALONSO:
Exit
SEBASTIAN:
But one fiend at a time,
SEBASTIAN:
I'll fight their legions o'er.
ANTONIO:
I'll be thy second.
ANTONIO:
Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO
GONZALO:
All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
GONZALO:
Like poison given to work a great time after,
GONZALO:
Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
GONZALO:
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
GONZALO:
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
GONZALO:
May now provoke them to.
ADRIAN:
Follow, I pray you.
ADRIAN:
Exeunt
ADRIAN:
ACT IV
ADRIAN:
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
ADRIAN:
Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA
PROSPERO:
If I have too austerely punish'd you,
PROSPERO:
Your compensation makes amends, for I
PROSPERO:
Have given you here a third of mine own life,
PROSPERO:
Or that for which I live, who once again
PROSPERO:
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
PROSPERO:
Were but my trials of thy love and thou
PROSPERO:
Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,
PROSPERO:
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
PROSPERO:
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
PROSPERO:
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
PROSPERO:
And make it halt behind her.
FERDINAND:
I do believe it
FERDINAND:
Against an oracle.
PROSPERO:
Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
PROSPERO:
Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
PROSPERO:
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
PROSPERO:
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
PROSPERO:
With full and holy rite be minister'd,
PROSPERO:
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
PROSPERO:
To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
PROSPERO:
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
PROSPERO:
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
PROSPERO:
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
PROSPERO:
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
FERDINAND:
As I hope
FERDINAND:
For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
FERDINAND:
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
FERDINAND:
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.
FERDINAND:
Our worser genius can, shall never melt
FERDINAND:
Mine honour into lust, to take away
FERDINAND:
The edge of that day's celebration
FERDINAND:
When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
FERDINAND:
Or Night kept chain'd below.
PROSPERO:
Fairly spoke.
PROSPERO:
Sit then and talk with her, she is thine own.
PROSPERO:
What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!
PROSPERO:
Enter ARIEL
ARIEL:
What would my potent master? here I am.
PROSPERO:
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
PROSPERO:
Did worthily perform, and I must use you
PROSPERO:
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
PROSPERO:
O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place
PROSPERO:
Incite them to quick motion, for I must
PROSPERO:
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
PROSPERO:
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
PROSPERO:
And they expect it from me.
ARIEL:
Presently?
PROSPERO:
Ay, with a twink.
ARIEL:
Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
ARIEL:
And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
ARIEL:
Each one, tripping on his toe,
ARIEL:
Will be here with mop and mow.
ARIEL:
Do you love me, master? no?
PROSPERO:
Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
PROSPERO:
Till thou dost hear me call.
ARIEL:
Well, I conceive.
ARIEL:
Exit
PROSPERO:
Look thou be true, do not give dalliance
PROSPERO:
Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
PROSPERO:
To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
PROSPERO:
Or else, good night your vow!
FERDINAND:
I warrant you sir,
FERDINAND:
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
FERDINAND:
Abates the ardour of my liver.
PROSPERO:
Well.
PROSPERO:
Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
PROSPERO:
Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!
PROSPERO:
No tongue! all eyes! be silent.
PROSPERO:
Soft music
PROSPERO:
Enter IRIS
IRIS:
Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
IRIS:
Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease,
IRIS:
Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
IRIS:
And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep,
IRIS:
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
IRIS:
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
IRIS:
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns, and thy broom -groves,
IRIS:
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
IRIS:
Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard,
IRIS:
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
IRIS:
Where thou thyself dost air,--the queen o' the sky,
IRIS:
Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
IRIS:
Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
IRIS:
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
IRIS:
To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain
IRIS:
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
IRIS:
Enter CERES
CERES:
Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
CERES:
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter,
CERES:
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
CERES:
Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
CERES:
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
CERES:
My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
CERES:
Rich scarf to my proud earth, why hath thy queen
CERES:
Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?
IRIS:
A contract of true love to celebrate,
IRIS:
And some donation freely to estate
IRIS:
On the blest lovers.
CERES:
Tell me, heavenly bow,
CERES:
If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
CERES:
Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
CERES:
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
CERES:
Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
CERES:
I have forsworn.
IRIS:
Of her society
IRIS:
Be not afraid: I met her deity
IRIS:
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
IRIS:
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
IRIS:
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
IRIS:
Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
IRIS:
Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain,
IRIS:
Mars's hot minion is returned again,
IRIS:
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
IRIS:
Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
IRIS:
And be a boy right out.
CERES:
High'st queen of state,
CERES:
Great Juno, comes, I know her by her gait.
CERES:
Enter JUNO
JUNO:
How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
JUNO:
To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be
JUNO:
And honour'd in their issue.
JUNO:
They sing
JUNO:
Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
JUNO:
Long continuance, and increasing,
JUNO:
Hourly joys be still upon you!
JUNO:
Juno sings her blessings upon you.
CERES:
Earth's increase, foison plenty,
CERES:
Barns and garners never empty,
CERES:
Vines and clustering bunches growing,
CERES:
Plants with goodly burthen bowing,
CERES:
Spring come to you at the farthest
CERES:
In the very end of harvest!
CERES:
Scarcity and want shall shun you,
CERES:
Ceres' blessing so is on you.
FERDINAND:
This is a most majestic vision, and
FERDINAND:
Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold
FERDINAND:
To think these spirits?
PROSPERO:
Spirits, which by mine art
PROSPERO:
I have from their confines call'd to enact
PROSPERO:
My present fancies.
FERDINAND:
Let me live here ever,
FERDINAND:
So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
FERDINAND:
Makes this place Paradise.
FERDINAND:
Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment
PROSPERO:
Sweet, now, silence!
PROSPERO:
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously,
PROSPERO:
There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
PROSPERO:
Or else our spell is marr'd.
IRIS:
You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
IRIS:
With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
IRIS:
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
IRIS:
Answer your summons, Juno does command
IRIS:
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
IRIS:
A contract of true love, be not too late.
IRIS:
Enter certain Nymphs
IRIS:
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
IRIS:
Come hither from the furrow and be merry
IRIS:
Make holiday, your rye-straw hats put on
IRIS:
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
IRIS:
In country footing.
IRIS:
Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they  join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance,  towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts  suddenly, and speaks, after which, to a  strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish
PROSPERO:
[Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy
PROSPERO:
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
PROSPERO:
Against my life: the minute of their plot
PROSPERO:
Is almost come.
PROSPERO:
To the Spirits
PROSPERO:
Well done! avoid, no more!
FERDINAND:
This is strange: your father's in some passion
FERDINAND:
That works him strongly.
MIRANDA:
Never till this day
MIRANDA:
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
PROSPERO:
You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
PROSPERO:
As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
PROSPERO:
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
PROSPERO:
As I foretold you, were all spirits and
PROSPERO:
Are melted into air, into thin air
PROSPERO:
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
PROSPERO:
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
PROSPERO:
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
PROSPERO:
Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
PROSPERO:
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
PROSPERO:
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
PROSPERO:
As dreams are made on, and our little life
PROSPERO:
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd,
PROSPERO:
Bear with my weakness, my, brain is troubled
PROSPERO:
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity
PROSPERO:
If you be pleased, retire into my cell
PROSPERO:
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
PROSPERO:
To still my beating mind.
MIRANDA:
We wish your peace.
MIRANDA:
Exeunt
PROSPERO:
Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.
PROSPERO:
Enter ARIEL
ARIEL:
Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
PROSPERO:
Spirit,
PROSPERO:
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
ARIEL:
Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
ARIEL:
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
ARIEL:
Lest I might anger thee.
PROSPERO:
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
ARIEL:
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,
ARIEL:
So fun of valour that they smote the air
ARIEL:
For breathing in their faces, beat the ground
ARIEL:
For kissing of their feet, yet always bending
ARIEL:
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour,
ARIEL:
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
ARIEL:
their ears,
ARIEL:
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
ARIEL:
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
ARIEL:
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
ARIEL:
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
ARIEL:
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
ARIEL:
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
ARIEL:
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
ARIEL:
O'erstunk their feet.
PROSPERO:
This was well done, my bird.
PROSPERO:
Thy shape invisible retain thou still
PROSPERO:
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
PROSPERO:
For stale to catch these thieves.
ARIEL:
I go, I go.
ARIEL:
Exit
PROSPERO:
A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
PROSPERO:
Nurture can never stick, on whom my pains,
PROSPERO:
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost,
PROSPERO:
And as with age his body uglier grows,
PROSPERO:
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
PROSPERO:
Even to roaring.
PROSPERO:
Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel,  and c
PROSPERO:
Come, hang them on this line.
PROSPERO:
PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet
CALIBAN:
Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
CALIBAN:
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
STEPHANO:
Monster, your fairy, which you say is
STEPHANO:
a harmless fairy, has done little better than
STEPHANO:
played the Jack with us.
TRINCULO:
Monster, I do smell all horse-piss, at
TRINCULO:
which my nose is in great indignation.
STEPHANO:
So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take
STEPHANO:
a displeasure against you, look you,--
TRINCULO:
Thou wert but a lost monster.
CALIBAN:
Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
CALIBAN:
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
CALIBAN:
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
CALIBAN:
All's hush'd as midnight yet.
TRINCULO:
Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--
STEPHANO:
There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
STEPHANO:
monster, but an infinite loss.
TRINCULO:
That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
TRINCULO:
harmless fairy, monster.
STEPHANO:
I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
STEPHANO:
for my labour.
CALIBAN:
Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
CALIBAN:
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
CALIBAN:
Do that good mischief which may make this island
CALIBAN:
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
CALIBAN:
For aye thy foot-licker.
STEPHANO:
Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
TRINCULO:
O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
TRINCULO:
what a wardrobe here is for thee!
CALIBAN:
Let it alone, thou fool, it is but trash.
TRINCULO:
O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
TRINCULO:
O king Stephano!
STEPHANO:
Put off that gown, Trinculo, by this hand, I'll have
STEPHANO:
that gown.
TRINCULO:
Thy grace shall have it.
CALIBAN:
The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
CALIBAN:
To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
CALIBAN:
And do the murder first: if he awake,
CALIBAN:
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
CALIBAN:
Make us strange stuff.
STEPHANO:
Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
STEPHANO:
is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
STEPHANO:
the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
STEPHANO:
hair and prove a bald jerkin.
TRINCULO:
Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.
STEPHANO:
I thank thee for that jest, here's a garment for't
STEPHANO:
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
STEPHANO:
country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
STEPHANO:
pass of pate, there's another garment for't.
TRINCULO:
Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and
TRINCULO:
away with the rest.
CALIBAN:
I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
CALIBAN:
And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
CALIBAN:
With foreheads villanous low.
STEPHANO:
Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
STEPHANO:
away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you
STEPHANO:
out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.
TRINCULO:
And this.
STEPHANO:
Ay, and this.
STEPHANO:
A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,  in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on
PROSPERO:
Hey, Mountain, hey!
ARIEL:
Silver I there it goes, Silver!
PROSPERO:
Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
PROSPERO:
CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out
PROSPERO:
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
PROSPERO:
With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
PROSPERO:
With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
PROSPERO:
Than pard or cat o' mountain.
ARIEL:
Hark, they roar!
PROSPERO:
Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
PROSPERO:
Lie at my mercy all mine enemies
PROSPERO:
Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
PROSPERO:
Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
PROSPERO:
Follow, and do me service.
PROSPERO:
Exeunt
PROSPERO:
ACT V
PROSPERO:
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
PROSPERO:
Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL
PROSPERO:
Now does my project gather to a head
PROSPERO:
My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time
PROSPERO:
Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
ARIEL:
On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,
ARIEL:
You said our work should cease.
PROSPERO:
I did say so,
PROSPERO:
When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
PROSPERO:
How fares the king and's followers?
ARIEL:
Confined together
ARIEL:
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
ARIEL:
Just as you left them, all prisoners, sir,
ARIEL:
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell,
ARIEL:
They cannot budge till your release. The king,
ARIEL:
His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
ARIEL:
And the remainder mourning over them,
ARIEL:
Brimful of sorrow and dismay, but chiefly
ARIEL:
Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo,'
ARIEL:
His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
ARIEL:
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
ARIEL:
That if you now beheld them, your affections
ARIEL:
Would become tender.
PROSPERO:
Dost thou think so, spirit?
ARIEL:
Mine would, sir, were I human.
PROSPERO:
And mine shall.
PROSPERO:
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
PROSPERO:
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
PROSPERO:
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
PROSPERO:
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
PROSPERO:
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
PROSPERO:
Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
PROSPERO:
Do I take part: the rarer action is
PROSPERO:
In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
PROSPERO:
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
PROSPERO:
Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel
PROSPERO:
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
PROSPERO:
And they shall be themselves.
ARIEL:
I'll fetch them, sir.
ARIEL:
Exit
PROSPERO:
Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
PROSPERO:
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
PROSPERO:
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
PROSPERO:
When he comes back, you demi-puppets that
PROSPERO:
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
PROSPERO:
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
PROSPERO:
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
PROSPERO:
To hear the solemn curfew, by whose aid,
PROSPERO:
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
PROSPERO:
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
PROSPERO:
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
PROSPERO:
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
PROSPERO:
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
PROSPERO:
With his own bolt, the strong-based promontory
PROSPERO:
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
PROSPERO:
The pine and cedar: graves at my command
PROSPERO:
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
PROSPERO:
By my so potent art. But this rough magic
PROSPERO:
I here abjure, and, when I have required
PROSPERO:
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
PROSPERO:
To work mine end upon their senses that
PROSPERO:
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
PROSPERO:
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
PROSPERO:
And deeper than did ever plummet sound
PROSPERO:
I'll drown my book.
PROSPERO:
Solemn music
PROSPERO:
Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a  frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO,  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,  and there stand charmed, which PROSPERO observing, speaks
PROSPERO:
A solemn air and the best comforter
PROSPERO:
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
PROSPERO:
Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
PROSPERO:
For you are spell-stopp'd.
PROSPERO:
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
PROSPERO:
Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
PROSPERO:
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
PROSPERO:
And as the morning steals upon the night,
PROSPERO:
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
PROSPERO:
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
PROSPERO:
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
PROSPERO:
My true preserver, and a loyal sir
PROSPERO:
To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
PROSPERO:
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
PROSPERO:
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter
PROSPERO:
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
PROSPERO:
Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
PROSPERO:
You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
PROSPERO:
Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian,
PROSPERO:
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
PROSPERO:
Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
PROSPERO:
Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
PROSPERO:
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
PROSPERO:
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
PROSPERO:
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
PROSPERO:
That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
PROSPERO:
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell
PROSPERO:
I will discase me, and myself present
PROSPERO:
As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit,
PROSPERO:
Thou shalt ere long be free.
PROSPERO:
ARIEL sings and helps to attire him
PROSPERO:
Where the bee sucks. there suck I
PROSPERO:
In a cowslip's bell I lie,
PROSPERO:
There I couch when owls do cry.
PROSPERO:
On the bat's back I do fly
PROSPERO:
After summer merrily.
PROSPERO:
Merrily, merrily shall I live now
PROSPERO:
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
PROSPERO:
Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee
PROSPERO:
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
PROSPERO:
To the king's ship, invisible as thou art
PROSPERO:
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
PROSPERO:
Under the hatches, the master and the boatswain
PROSPERO:
Being awake, enforce them to this place,
PROSPERO:
And presently, I prithee.
ARIEL:
I drink the air before me, and return
ARIEL:
Or ere your pulse twice beat.
ARIEL:
Exit
GONZALO:
All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
GONZALO:
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
GONZALO:
Out of this fearful country!
PROSPERO:
Behold, sir king,
PROSPERO:
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero
PROSPERO:
For more assurance that a living prince
PROSPERO:
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,
PROSPERO:
And to thee and thy company I bid
PROSPERO:
A hearty welcome.
ALONSO:
Whether thou best he or no,
ALONSO:
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
ALONSO:
As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
ALONSO:
Beats as of flesh and blood, and, since I saw thee,
ALONSO:
The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
ALONSO:
I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
ALONSO:
An if this be at all, a most strange story.
ALONSO:
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
ALONSO:
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
ALONSO:
Be living and be here?
PROSPERO:
First, noble friend,
PROSPERO:
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
PROSPERO:
Be measured or confined.
GONZALO:
Whether this be
GONZALO:
Or be not, I'll not swear.
PROSPERO:
You do yet taste
PROSPERO:
Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
PROSPERO:
Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
PROSPERO:
Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
PROSPERO:
But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
PROSPERO:
I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
PROSPERO:
And justify you traitors: at this time
PROSPERO:
I will tell no tales.
SEBASTIAN:
[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
PROSPERO:
No.
PROSPERO:
For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
PROSPERO:
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
PROSPERO:
Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require
PROSPERO:
My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
PROSPERO:
Thou must restore.
ALONSO:
If thou be'st Prospero,
ALONSO:
Give us particulars of thy preservation,
ALONSO:
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
ALONSO:
Were wreck'd upon this shore, where I have lost--
ALONSO:
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
ALONSO:
My dear son Ferdinand.
PROSPERO:
I am woe for't, sir.
ALONSO:
Irreparable is the loss, and patience
ALONSO:
Says it is past her cure.
PROSPERO:
I rather think
PROSPERO:
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
PROSPERO:
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
PROSPERO:
And rest myself content.
ALONSO:
You the like loss!
PROSPERO:
As great to me as late, and, supportable
PROSPERO:
To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
PROSPERO:
Than you may call to comfort you, for I
PROSPERO:
Have lost my daughter.
ALONSO:
A daughter?
ALONSO:
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
ALONSO:
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
ALONSO:
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
ALONSO:
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
PROSPERO:
In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
PROSPERO:
At this encounter do so much admire
PROSPERO:
That they devour their reason and scarce think
PROSPERO:
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
PROSPERO:
Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
PROSPERO:
Been justled from your senses, know for certain
PROSPERO:
That I am Prospero and that very duke
PROSPERO:
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
PROSPERO:
Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
PROSPERO:
To be the lord on't. No more yet of this,
PROSPERO:
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
PROSPERO:
Not a relation for a breakfast nor
PROSPERO:
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir,
PROSPERO:
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
PROSPERO:
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
PROSPERO:
My dukedom since you have given me again,
PROSPERO:
I will requite you with as good a thing,
PROSPERO:
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
PROSPERO:
As much as me my dukedom.
PROSPERO:
Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess
MIRANDA:
Sweet lord, you play me false.
FERDINAND:
No, my dear'st love,
FERDINAND:
I would not for the world.
MIRANDA:
Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
MIRANDA:
And I would call it, fair play.
ALONSO:
If this prove
ALONSO:
A vision of the Island, one dear son
ALONSO:
Shall I twice lose.
SEBASTIAN:
A most high miracle!
FERDINAND:
Though the seas threaten, they are merciful,
FERDINAND:
I have cursed them without cause.
FERDINAND:
Kneels
ALONSO:
Now all the blessings
ALONSO:
Of a glad father compass thee about!
ALONSO:
Arise, and say how thou camest here.
MIRANDA:
O, wonder!
MIRANDA:
How many goodly creatures are there here!
MIRANDA:
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
MIRANDA:
That has such people in't!
PROSPERO:
'Tis new to thee.
ALONSO:
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
ALONSO:
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours
ALONSO:
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
ALONSO:
And brought us thus together?
FERDINAND:
Sir, she is mortal,
FERDINAND:
But by immortal Providence she's mine
FERDINAND:
I chose her when I could not ask my father
FERDINAND:
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
FERDINAND:
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
FERDINAND:
Of whom so often I have heard renown,
FERDINAND:
But never saw before, of whom I have
FERDINAND:
Received a second life, and second father
FERDINAND:
This lady makes him to me.
ALONSO:
I am hers
ALONSO:
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
ALONSO:
Must ask my child forgiveness!
PROSPERO:
There, sir, stop
PROSPERO:
Let us not burthen our remembrance with
PROSPERO:
A heaviness that's gone.
GONZALO:
I have inly wept,
GONZALO:
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
GONZALO:
And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
GONZALO:
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
GONZALO:
Which brought us hither.
ALONSO:
I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
GONZALO:
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
GONZALO:
Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
GONZALO:
Beyond a common joy, and set it down
GONZALO:
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
GONZALO:
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
GONZALO:
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
GONZALO:
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
GONZALO:
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
GONZALO:
When no man was his own.
ALONSO:
[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands
ALONSO:
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
ALONSO:
That doth not wish you joy!
GONZALO:
Be it so! Amen!
GONZALO:
Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following
GONZALO:
O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us
GONZALO:
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
GONZALO:
This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
GONZALO:
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
GONZALO:
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
Boatswain:
The best news is, that we have safely found
Boatswain:
Our king and company, the next, our ship--
Boatswain:
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
Boatswain:
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
Boatswain:
We first put out to sea.
ARIEL:
[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service
ARIEL:
Have I done since I went.
PROSPERO:
[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
ALONSO:
These are not natural events, they strengthen
ALONSO:
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
Boatswain:
If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
Boatswain:
I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
Boatswain:
And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches,
Boatswain:
Where but even now with strange and several noises
Boatswain:
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
Boatswain:
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
Boatswain:
We were awaked, straightway, at liberty,
Boatswain:
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
Boatswain:
Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
Boatswain:
Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
Boatswain:
Even in a dream, were we divided from them
Boatswain:
And were brought moping hither.
ARIEL:
[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?
PROSPERO:
[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
ALONSO:
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
ALONSO:
And there is in this business more than nature
ALONSO:
Was ever conduct of: some oracle
ALONSO:
Must rectify our knowledge.
PROSPERO:
Sir, my liege,
PROSPERO:
Do not infest your mind with beating on
PROSPERO:
The strangeness of this business, at pick'd leisure
PROSPERO:
Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
PROSPERO:
Which to you shall seem probable, of every
PROSPERO:
These happen'd accidents, till when, be cheerful
PROSPERO:
And think of each thing well.
PROSPERO:
Aside to ARIEL
PROSPERO:
Come hither, spirit
PROSPERO:
Set Caliban and his companions free,
PROSPERO:
Untie the spell.
PROSPERO:
Exit ARIEL
PROSPERO:
How fares my gracious sir?
PROSPERO:
There are yet missing of your company
PROSPERO:
Some few odd lads that you remember not.
PROSPERO:
Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel
STEPHANO:
Every man shift for all the rest, and
STEPHANO:
let no man take care for himself, for all is
STEPHANO:
but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!
TRINCULO:
If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
TRINCULO:
here's a goodly sight.
CALIBAN:
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
CALIBAN:
How fine my master is! I am afraid
CALIBAN:
He will chastise me.
SEBASTIAN:
Ha, ha!
SEBASTIAN:
What things are these, my lord Antonio?
SEBASTIAN:
Will money buy 'em?
ANTONIO:
Very like, one of them
ANTONIO:
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.
PROSPERO:
Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
PROSPERO:
Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
PROSPERO:
His mother was a witch, and one so strong
PROSPERO:
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
PROSPERO:
And deal in her command without her power.
PROSPERO:
These three have robb'd me, and this demi-devil--
PROSPERO:
For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
PROSPERO:
To take my life. Two of these fellows you
PROSPERO:
Must know and own, this thing of darkness!
PROSPERO:
Acknowledge mine.
CALIBAN:
I shall be pinch'd to death.
ALONSO:
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
SEBASTIAN:
He is drunk now: where had he wine?
ALONSO:
And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
ALONSO:
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
ALONSO:
How camest thou in this pickle?
TRINCULO:
I have been in such a pickle since I
TRINCULO:
saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
TRINCULO:
my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.
SEBASTIAN:
Why, how now, Stephano!
STEPHANO:
O, touch me not, I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
PROSPERO:
You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?
STEPHANO:
I should have been a sore one then.
ALONSO:
This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
ALONSO:
Pointing to Caliban
PROSPERO:
He is as disproportion'd in his manners
PROSPERO:
As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell,
PROSPERO:
Take with you your companions, as you look
PROSPERO:
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
CALIBAN:
Ay, that I will, and I'll be wise hereafter
CALIBAN:
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
CALIBAN:
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
CALIBAN:
And worship this dull fool!
PROSPERO:
Go to, away!
ALONSO:
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
SEBASTIAN:
Or stole it, rather.
SEBASTIAN:
Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO
PROSPERO:
Sir, I invite your highness and your train
PROSPERO:
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
PROSPERO:
For this one night, which, part of it, I'll waste
PROSPERO:
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
PROSPERO:
Go quick away, the story of my life
PROSPERO:
And the particular accidents gone by
PROSPERO:
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
PROSPERO:
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
PROSPERO:
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
PROSPERO:
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized,
PROSPERO:
And thence retire me to my Milan, where
PROSPERO:
Every third thought shall be my grave.
ALONSO:
I long
ALONSO:
To hear the story of your life, which must
ALONSO:
Take the ear strangely.
PROSPERO:
I'll deliver all,
PROSPERO:
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
PROSPERO:
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
PROSPERO:
Your royal fleet far off.
PROSPERO:
Aside to ARIEL
PROSPERO:
My Ariel, chick,
PROSPERO:
That is thy charge: then to the elements
PROSPERO:
Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.
PROSPERO:
Exeunt
PROSPERO:
EPILOGUE
PROSPERO:
SPOKEN BY PROSPERO
PROSPERO:
Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
PROSPERO:
And what strength I have's mine own,
PROSPERO:
Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
PROSPERO:
I must be here confined by you,
PROSPERO:
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
PROSPERO:
Since I have my dukedom got
PROSPERO:
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
PROSPERO:
In this bare island by your spell,
PROSPERO:
But release me from my bands
PROSPERO:
With the help of your good hands
PROSPERO:
Gentle breath of yours my sails
PROSPERO:
Must fill, or else my project fails,
PROSPERO:
Which was to please. Now I want
PROSPERO:
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
PROSPERO:
And my ending is despair,
PROSPERO:
Unless I be relieved by prayer,
PROSPERO:
Which pierces so that it assaults
PROSPERO:
Mercy itself and frees all faults.
PROSPERO:
As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
PROSPERO:
Let your indulgence set me free.
