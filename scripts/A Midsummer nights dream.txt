FORD:
ACT I
FORD:
SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.
FORD:
Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants
THESEUS:
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
THESEUS:
Draws on apace, four happy days bring in
THESEUS:
Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
THESEUS:
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
THESEUS:
Like to a step-dame or a dowager
THESEUS:
Long withering out a young man revenue.
HIPPOLYTA:
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night,
HIPPOLYTA:
Four nights will quickly dream away the time,
HIPPOLYTA:
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
HIPPOLYTA:
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
HIPPOLYTA:
Of our solemnities.
THESEUS:
Go, Philostrate,
THESEUS:
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments,
THESEUS:
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,
THESEUS:
Turn melancholy forth to funerals,
THESEUS:
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
THESEUS:
Exit PHILOSTRATE
THESEUS:
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
THESEUS:
And won thy love, doing thee injuries,
THESEUS:
But I will wed thee in another key,
THESEUS:
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
THESEUS:
Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS
EGEUS:
Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
THESEUS:
Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
EGEUS:
Full of vexation come I, with complaint
EGEUS:
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
EGEUS:
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
EGEUS:
This man hath my consent to marry her.
EGEUS:
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
EGEUS:
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child,
EGEUS:
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
EGEUS:
And interchanged love-tokens with my child
EGEUS:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
EGEUS:
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
EGEUS:
And stolen the impression of her fantasy
EGEUS:
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
EGEUS:
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
EGEUS:
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth
EGEUS:
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
EGEUS:
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
EGEUS:
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
EGEUS:
Be it so she, will not here before your grace
EGEUS:
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
EGEUS:
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
EGEUS:
As she is mine, I may dispose of her
EGEUS:
Which shall be either to this gentleman
EGEUS:
Or to her death, according to our law
EGEUS:
Immediately provided in that case.
THESEUS:
What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid
THESEUS:
To you your father should be as a god,
THESEUS:
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
THESEUS:
To whom you are but as a form in wax
THESEUS:
By him imprinted and within his power
THESEUS:
To leave the figure or disfigure it.
THESEUS:
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
HERMIA:
So is Lysander.
THESEUS:
In himself he is,
THESEUS:
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
THESEUS:
The other must be held the worthier.
HERMIA:
I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
THESEUS:
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
HERMIA:
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
HERMIA:
I know not by what power I am made bold,
HERMIA:
Nor how it may concern my modesty,
HERMIA:
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts,
HERMIA:
But I beseech your grace that I may know
HERMIA:
The worst that may befall me in this case,
HERMIA:
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
THESEUS:
Either to die the death or to abjure
THESEUS:
For ever the society of men.
THESEUS:
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
THESEUS:
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
THESEUS:
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
THESEUS:
You can endure the livery of a nun,
THESEUS:
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
THESEUS:
To live a barren sister all your life,
THESEUS:
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
THESEUS:
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
THESEUS:
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,
THESEUS:
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
THESEUS:
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
THESEUS:
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
HERMIA:
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
HERMIA:
Ere I will my virgin patent up
HERMIA:
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
HERMIA:
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
THESEUS:
Take time to pause, and, by the nest new moon--
THESEUS:
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
THESEUS:
For everlasting bond of fellowship--
THESEUS:
Upon that day either prepare to die
THESEUS:
For disobedience to your father's will,
THESEUS:
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
THESEUS:
Or on Diana's altar to protest
THESEUS:
For aye austerity and single life.
DEMETRIUS:
Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
DEMETRIUS:
Thy crazed title to my certain right.
LYSANDER:
You have her father's love, Demetrius,
LYSANDER:
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
EGEUS:
Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
EGEUS:
And what is mine my love shall render him.
EGEUS:
And she is mine, and all my right of her
EGEUS:
I do estate unto Demetrius.
LYSANDER:
I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
LYSANDER:
As well possess'd, my love is more than his,
LYSANDER:
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
LYSANDER:
If not with vantage, as Demetrius',
LYSANDER:
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
LYSANDER:
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia
LYSANDER:
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
LYSANDER:
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
LYSANDER:
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
LYSANDER:
And won her soul, and she, sweet lady, dotes,
LYSANDER:
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
LYSANDER:
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
THESEUS:
I must confess that I have heard so much,
THESEUS:
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof,
THESEUS:
But, being over-full of self-affairs,
THESEUS:
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come,
THESEUS:
And come, Egeus, you shall go with me,
THESEUS:
I have some private schooling for you both.
THESEUS:
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
THESEUS:
To fit your fancies to your father's will,
THESEUS:
Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
THESEUS:
Which by no means we may extenuate--
THESEUS:
To death, or to a vow of single life.
THESEUS:
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
THESEUS:
Demetrius and Egeus, go along
THESEUS:
I must employ you in some business
THESEUS:
Against our nuptial and confer with you
THESEUS:
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
EGEUS:
With duty and desire we follow you.
EGEUS:
Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA
LYSANDER:
How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
LYSANDER:
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
HERMIA:
Belike for want of rain, which I could well
HERMIA:
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
LYSANDER:
Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
LYSANDER:
Could ever hear by tale or history,
LYSANDER:
The course of true love never did run smooth,
LYSANDER:
But, either it was different in blood,--
HERMIA:
O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
LYSANDER:
Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
HERMIA:
O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
LYSANDER:
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
HERMIA:
O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
LYSANDER:
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
LYSANDER:
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
LYSANDER:
Making it momentany as a sound,
LYSANDER:
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
LYSANDER:
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
LYSANDER:
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
LYSANDER:
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
LYSANDER:
The jaws of darkness do devour it up
LYSANDER:
So quick bright things come to confusion.
HERMIA:
If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
HERMIA:
It stands as an edict in destiny
HERMIA:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
HERMIA:
Because it is a customary cross,
HERMIA:
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
HERMIA:
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
LYSANDER:
A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
LYSANDER:
I have a widow aunt, a dowager
LYSANDER:
Of great revenue, and she hath no child
LYSANDER:
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,
LYSANDER:
And she respects me as her only son.
LYSANDER:
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,
LYSANDER:
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
LYSANDER:
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
LYSANDER:
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night,
LYSANDER:
And in the wood, a league without the town,
LYSANDER:
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
LYSANDER:
To do observance to a morn of May,
LYSANDER:
There will I stay for thee.
HERMIA:
My good Lysander!
HERMIA:
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
HERMIA:
By his best arrow with the golden head,
HERMIA:
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
HERMIA:
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
HERMIA:
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
HERMIA:
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
HERMIA:
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
HERMIA:
In number more than ever women spoke,
HERMIA:
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
HERMIA:
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
LYSANDER:
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
LYSANDER:
Enter HELENA
HERMIA:
God speed fair Helena! whither away?
HELENA:
Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
HELENA:
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
HELENA:
Your eyes are lode-stars, and your tongue's sweet air
HELENA:
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
HELENA:
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
HELENA:
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
HELENA:
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go,
HELENA:
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
HELENA:
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
HELENA:
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
HELENA:
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
HELENA:
O, teach me how you look, and with what art
HELENA:
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
HERMIA:
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
HELENA:
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
HERMIA:
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
HELENA:
O that my prayers could such affection move!
HERMIA:
The more I hate, the more he follows me.
HELENA:
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
HERMIA:
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
HELENA:
None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
HERMIA:
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face,
HERMIA:
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
HERMIA:
Before the time I did Lysander see,
HERMIA:
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me
HERMIA:
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
HERMIA:
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
LYSANDER:
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold
LYSANDER:
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
LYSANDER:
Her silver visage in the watery glass,
LYSANDER:
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
LYSANDER:
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
LYSANDER:
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
HERMIA:
And in the wood, where often you and I
HERMIA:
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
HERMIA:
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
HERMIA:
There my Lysander and myself shall meet,
HERMIA:
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
HERMIA:
To seek new friends and stranger companies.
HERMIA:
Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us,
HERMIA:
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
HERMIA:
Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
HERMIA:
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
LYSANDER:
I will, my Hermia.
LYSANDER:
Exit HERMIA
LYSANDER:
Helena, adieu
LYSANDER:
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
LYSANDER:
Exit
HELENA:
How happy some o'er other some can be!
HELENA:
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
HELENA:
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so,
HELENA:
He will not know what all but he do know
HELENA:
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
HELENA:
So I, admiring of his qualities
HELENA:
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
HELENA:
Love can transpose to form and dignity
HELENA:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
HELENA:
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind
HELENA:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste,
HELENA:
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
HELENA:
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
HELENA:
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
HELENA:
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
HELENA:
So the boy Love is perjured every where
HELENA:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
HELENA:
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine,
HELENA:
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
HELENA:
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
HELENA:
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight
HELENA:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
HELENA:
Pursue her, and for this intelligence
HELENA:
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense
HELENA:
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
HELENA:
To have his sight thither and back again.
HELENA:
Exit
HELENA:
SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.
HELENA:
Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
QUINCE:
Is all our company here?
BOTTOM:
You were best to call them generally, man by man,
BOTTOM:
according to the scrip.
QUINCE:
Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
QUINCE:
thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
QUINCE:
interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
QUINCE:
wedding-day at night.
BOTTOM:
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
BOTTOM:
on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
BOTTOM:
to a point.
QUINCE:
Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
QUINCE:
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
BOTTOM:
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
BOTTOM:
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
BOTTOM:
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
QUINCE:
Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
BOTTOM:
Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
QUINCE:
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
BOTTOM:
What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
QUINCE:
A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
BOTTOM:
That will ask some tears in the true performing of
BOTTOM:
it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
BOTTOM:
eyes, I will move storms, I will condole in some
BOTTOM:
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
BOTTOM:
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
BOTTOM:
tear a cat in, to make all split.
BOTTOM:
The raging rocks
BOTTOM:
And shivering shocks
BOTTOM:
Shall break the locks
BOTTOM:
Of prison gates,
BOTTOM:
And Phibbus' car
BOTTOM:
Shall shine from far
BOTTOM:
And make and mar
BOTTOM:
The foolish Fates.
BOTTOM:
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
BOTTOM:
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein, a lover is
BOTTOM:
more condoling.
QUINCE:
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
FLUTE:
Here, Peter Quince.
QUINCE:
Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
FLUTE:
What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
QUINCE:
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
FLUTE:
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman, I have a beard coming.
QUINCE:
That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
QUINCE:
you may speak as small as you will.
BOTTOM:
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
BOTTOM:
speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
BOTTOM:
Thisne,' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
BOTTOM:
and lady dear!'
QUINCE:
No, no, you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.
BOTTOM:
Well, proceed.
QUINCE:
Robin Starveling, the tailor.
STARVELING:
Here, Peter Quince.
QUINCE:
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
QUINCE:
Tom Snout, the tinker.
SNOUT:
Here, Peter Quince.
QUINCE:
You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father
QUINCE:
Snug, the joiner, you, the lion's part: and, I
QUINCE:
hope, here is a play fitted.
SNUG:
Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
SNUG:
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
QUINCE:
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
BOTTOM:
Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
BOTTOM:
do any man's heart good to hear me, I will roar,
BOTTOM:
that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
BOTTOM:
let him roar again.'
QUINCE:
An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
QUINCE:
the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek,
QUINCE:
and that were enough to hang us all.
ALL:
That would hang us, every mother's son.
BOTTOM:
I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
BOTTOM:
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
BOTTOM:
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
BOTTOM:
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
BOTTOM:
sucking dove, I will roar you an 'twere any
BOTTOM:
nightingale.
QUINCE:
You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a
QUINCE:
sweet-faced man, a proper man, as one shall see in a
QUINCE:
summer's day, a most lovely gentleman-like man
QUINCE:
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
BOTTOM:
Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
BOTTOM:
to play it in?
QUINCE:
Why, what you will.
BOTTOM:
I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
BOTTOM:
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
BOTTOM:
beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
BOTTOM:
perfect yellow.
QUINCE:
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
QUINCE:
then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
QUINCE:
are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
QUINCE:
you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night,
QUINCE:
and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
QUINCE:
town, by moonlight, there will we rehearse, for if
QUINCE:
we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
QUINCE:
company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
QUINCE:
will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
QUINCE:
wants. I pray you, fail me not.
BOTTOM:
We will meet, and there we may rehearse most
BOTTOM:
obscenely and courageously. Take pains, be perfect: adieu.
QUINCE:
At the duke's oak we meet.
BOTTOM:
Enough, hold or cut bow-strings.
BOTTOM:
Exeunt
BOTTOM:
ACT II
BOTTOM:
SCENE I. A wood near Athens.
BOTTOM:
Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK
PUCK:
How now, spirit! whither wander you?
Fairy:
Over hill, over dale,
Fairy:
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Fairy:
Over park, over pale,
Fairy:
Thorough flood, thorough fire,
Fairy:
I do wander everywhere,
Fairy:
Swifter than the moon's sphere,
Fairy:
And I serve the fairy queen,
Fairy:
To dew her orbs upon the green.
Fairy:
The cowslips tall her pensioners be
Fairy:
In their gold coats spots you see,
Fairy:
Those be rubies, fairy favours,
Fairy:
In those freckles live their savours
Fairy:
I must go seek some dewdrops here
Fairy:
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
Fairy:
Farewell, thou lob of spirits, I'll be gone
Fairy:
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
PUCK:
The king doth keep his revels here to-night
PUCK:
Take heed the queen come not within his sight,
PUCK:
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
PUCK:
Because that she as her attendant hath
PUCK:
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king,
PUCK:
She never had so sweet a changeling,
PUCK:
And jealous Oberon would have the child
PUCK:
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild,
PUCK:
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
PUCK:
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
PUCK:
And now they never meet in grove or green,
PUCK:
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
PUCK:
But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
PUCK:
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
Fairy:
Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
Fairy:
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
Fairy:
Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
Fairy:
That frights the maidens of the villagery,
Fairy:
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
Fairy:
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn,
Fairy:
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,
Fairy:
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
Fairy:
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
Fairy:
You do their work, and they shall have good luck
Fairy:
Are not you he?
PUCK:
Thou speak'st aright,
PUCK:
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
PUCK:
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
PUCK:
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
PUCK:
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal
PUCK:
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
PUCK:
In very likeness of a roasted crab,
PUCK:
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
PUCK:
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
PUCK:
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
PUCK:
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me,
PUCK:
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
PUCK:
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough,
PUCK:
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
PUCK:
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
PUCK:
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
PUCK:
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.
Fairy:
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
Fairy:
Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train, from the other, TITANIA, with hers
OBERON:
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
TITANIA:
What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence
TITANIA:
I have forsworn his bed and company.
OBERON:
Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?
TITANIA:
Then I must be thy lady: but I know
TITANIA:
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
TITANIA:
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
TITANIA:
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
TITANIA:
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
TITANIA:
Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
TITANIA:
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
TITANIA:
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
TITANIA:
To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
TITANIA:
To give their bed joy and prosperity.
OBERON:
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
OBERON:
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
OBERON:
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
OBERON:
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
OBERON:
From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
OBERON:
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
OBERON:
With Ariadne and Antiopa?
TITANIA:
These are the forgeries of jealousy
TITANIA:
And never, since the middle summer's spring,
TITANIA:
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
TITANIA:
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
TITANIA:
Or in the beached margent of the sea,
TITANIA:
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
TITANIA:
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
TITANIA:
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
TITANIA:
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
TITANIA:
Contagious fogs, which falling in the land
TITANIA:
Have every pelting river made so proud
TITANIA:
That they have overborne their continents
TITANIA:
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
TITANIA:
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
TITANIA:
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard,
TITANIA:
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
TITANIA:
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock,
TITANIA:
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
TITANIA:
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
TITANIA:
For lack of tread are undistinguishable
TITANIA:
The human mortals want their winter here,
TITANIA:
No night is now with hymn or carol blest
TITANIA:
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
TITANIA:
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
TITANIA:
That rheumatic diseases do abound
TITANIA:
And thorough this distemperature we see
TITANIA:
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
TITANIA:
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
TITANIA:
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
TITANIA:
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
TITANIA:
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
TITANIA:
The childing autumn, angry winter, change
TITANIA:
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
TITANIA:
By their increase, now knows not which is which
TITANIA:
And this same progeny of evils comes
TITANIA:
From our debate, from our dissension,
TITANIA:
We are their parents and original.
OBERON:
Do you amend it then, it lies in you
OBERON:
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
OBERON:
I do but beg a little changeling boy,
OBERON:
To be my henchman.
TITANIA:
Set your heart at rest
TITANIA:
The fairy land buys not the child of me.
TITANIA:
His mother was a votaress of my order
TITANIA:
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
TITANIA:
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
TITANIA:
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
TITANIA:
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
TITANIA:
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
TITANIA:
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind,
TITANIA:
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
TITANIA:
Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
TITANIA:
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
TITANIA:
To fetch me trifles, and return again,
TITANIA:
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
TITANIA:
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,
TITANIA:
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
TITANIA:
And for her sake I will not part with him.
OBERON:
How long within this wood intend you stay?
TITANIA:
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
TITANIA:
If you will patiently dance in our round
TITANIA:
And see our moonlight revels, go with us,
TITANIA:
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
OBERON:
Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
TITANIA:
Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
TITANIA:
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
TITANIA:
Exit TITANIA with her train
OBERON:
Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
OBERON:
Till I torment thee for this injury.
OBERON:
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
OBERON:
Since once I sat upon a promontory,
OBERON:
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
OBERON:
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
OBERON:
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
OBERON:
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
OBERON:
To hear the sea-maid's music.
PUCK:
I remember.
OBERON:
That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
OBERON:
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
OBERON:
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
OBERON:
At a fair vestal throned by the west,
OBERON:
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
OBERON:
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts,
OBERON:
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
OBERON:
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
OBERON:
And the imperial votaress passed on,
OBERON:
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
OBERON:
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell
OBERON:
It fell upon a little western flower,
OBERON:
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
OBERON:
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
OBERON:
Fetch me that flower, the herb I shew'd thee once
OBERON:
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
OBERON:
Will make or man or woman madly dote
OBERON:
Upon the next live creature that it sees.
OBERON:
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again
OBERON:
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
PUCK:
I'll put a girdle round about the earth
PUCK:
In forty minutes.
PUCK:
Exit
OBERON:
Having once this juice,
OBERON:
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
OBERON:
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
OBERON:
The next thing then she waking looks upon,
OBERON:
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
OBERON:
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
OBERON:
She shall pursue it with the soul of love
OBERON:
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
OBERON:
As I can take it with another herb,
OBERON:
I'll make her render up her page to me.
OBERON:
But who comes here? I am invisible,
OBERON:
And I will overhear their conference.
OBERON:
Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him
DEMETRIUS:
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
DEMETRIUS:
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
DEMETRIUS:
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
DEMETRIUS:
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood,
DEMETRIUS:
And here am I, and wode within this wood,
DEMETRIUS:
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
DEMETRIUS:
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
HELENA:
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant,
HELENA:
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
HELENA:
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
HELENA:
And I shall have no power to follow you.
DEMETRIUS:
Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
DEMETRIUS:
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
DEMETRIUS:
Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?
HELENA:
And even for that do I love you the more.
HELENA:
I am your spaniel, and, Demetrius,
HELENA:
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you
HELENA:
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
HELENA:
Neglect me, lose me, only give me leave,
HELENA:
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
HELENA:
What worser place can I beg in your love,--
HELENA:
And yet a place of high respect with me,--
HELENA:
Than to be used as you use your dog?
DEMETRIUS:
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,
DEMETRIUS:
For I am sick when I do look on thee.
HELENA:
And I am sick when I look not on you.
DEMETRIUS:
You do impeach your modesty too much,
DEMETRIUS:
To leave the city and commit yourself
DEMETRIUS:
Into the hands of one that loves you not,
DEMETRIUS:
To trust the opportunity of night
DEMETRIUS:
And the ill counsel of a desert place
DEMETRIUS:
With the rich worth of your virginity.
HELENA:
Your virtue is my privilege: for that
HELENA:
It is not night when I do see your face,
HELENA:
Therefore I think I am not in the night,
HELENA:
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
HELENA:
For you in my respect are all the world
HELENA:
Then how can it be said I am alone,
HELENA:
When all the world is here to look on me?
DEMETRIUS:
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
DEMETRIUS:
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
HELENA:
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
HELENA:
Run when you will, the story shall be changed
HELENA:
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase,
HELENA:
The dove pursues the griffin, the mild hind
HELENA:
Makes speed to catch the tiger, bootless speed,
HELENA:
When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
DEMETRIUS:
I will not stay thy questions, let me go
DEMETRIUS:
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
DEMETRIUS:
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
HELENA:
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
HELENA:
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
HELENA:
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
HELENA:
We cannot fight for love, as men may do,
HELENA:
We should be wood and were not made to woo.
HELENA:
Exit DEMETRIUS
HELENA:
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
HELENA:
To die upon the hand I love so well.
HELENA:
Exit
OBERON:
Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
OBERON:
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
OBERON:
Re-enter PUCK
OBERON:
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
PUCK:
Ay, there it is.
OBERON:
I pray thee, give it me.
OBERON:
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
OBERON:
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
OBERON:
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
OBERON:
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine
OBERON:
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
OBERON:
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight,
OBERON:
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
OBERON:
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
OBERON:
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
OBERON:
And make her full of hateful fantasies.
OBERON:
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove
OBERON:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
OBERON:
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes,
OBERON:
But do it when the next thing he espies
OBERON:
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
OBERON:
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
OBERON:
Effect it with some care, that he may prove
OBERON:
More fond on her than she upon her love
OBERON:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
PUCK:
Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.
PUCK:
Exeunt
PUCK:
SCENE II. Another part of the wood.
PUCK:
Enter TITANIA, with her train
TITANIA:
Come, now a roundel and a fairy song,
TITANIA:
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence,
TITANIA:
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
TITANIA:
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
TITANIA:
To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
TITANIA:
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
TITANIA:
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep,
TITANIA:
Then to your offices and let me rest.
TITANIA:
The Fairies sing
TITANIA:
You spotted snakes with double tongue,
TITANIA:
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen,
TITANIA:
Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
TITANIA:
Come not near our fairy queen.
TITANIA:
Philomel, with melody
TITANIA:
Sing in our sweet lullaby,
TITANIA:
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby
TITANIA:
Never harm,
TITANIA:
Nor spell nor charm,
TITANIA:
Come our lovely lady nigh,
TITANIA:
So, good night, with lullaby.
TITANIA:
Weaving spiders, come not here,
TITANIA:
Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
TITANIA:
Beetles black, approach not near,
TITANIA:
Worm nor snail, do no offence.
TITANIA:
Philomel, with melody,  and c.
Fairy:
Hence, away! now all is well
Fairy:
One aloof stand sentinel.
Fairy:
Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps
Fairy:
Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids
OBERON:
What thou seest when thou dost wake,
OBERON:
Do it for thy true-love take,
OBERON:
Love and languish for his sake
OBERON:
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
OBERON:
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
OBERON:
In thy eye that shall appear
OBERON:
When thou wakest, it is thy dear
OBERON:
Wake when some vile thing is near.
OBERON:
Exit
OBERON:
Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA
LYSANDER:
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood,
LYSANDER:
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way
LYSANDER:
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
LYSANDER:
And tarry for the comfort of the day.
HERMIA:
Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed,
HERMIA:
For I upon this bank will rest my head.
LYSANDER:
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both,
LYSANDER:
One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
HERMIA:
Nay, good Lysander, for my sake, my dear,
HERMIA:
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
LYSANDER:
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
LYSANDER:
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
LYSANDER:
I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
LYSANDER:
So that but one heart we can make of it,
LYSANDER:
Two bosoms interchained with an oath,
LYSANDER:
So then two bosoms and a single troth.
LYSANDER:
Then by your side no bed-room me deny,
LYSANDER:
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
HERMIA:
Lysander riddles very prettily
HERMIA:
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
HERMIA:
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
HERMIA:
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
HERMIA:
Lie further off, in human modesty,
HERMIA:
Such separation as may well be said
HERMIA:
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
HERMIA:
So far be distant, and, good night, sweet friend
HERMIA:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
LYSANDER:
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I,
LYSANDER:
And then end life when I end loyalty!
LYSANDER:
Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!
HERMIA:
With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
HERMIA:
They sleep
HERMIA:
Enter PUCK
PUCK:
Through the forest have I gone.
PUCK:
But Athenian found I none,
PUCK:
On whose eyes I might approve
PUCK:
This flower's force in stirring love.
PUCK:
Night and silence.--Who is here?
PUCK:
Weeds of Athens he doth wear
PUCK:
This is he, my master said,
PUCK:
Despised the Athenian maid,
PUCK:
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
PUCK:
On the dank and dirty ground.
PUCK:
Pretty soul! she durst not lie
PUCK:
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
PUCK:
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
PUCK:
All the power this charm doth owe.
PUCK:
When thou wakest, let love forbid
PUCK:
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid
PUCK:
So awake when I am gone,
PUCK:
For I must now to Oberon.
PUCK:
Exit
PUCK:
Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running
HELENA:
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
DEMETRIUS:
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
HELENA:
O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.
DEMETRIUS:
Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
DEMETRIUS:
Exit
HELENA:
O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
HELENA:
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
HELENA:
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies,
HELENA:
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
HELENA:
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears
HELENA:
If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
HELENA:
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear,
HELENA:
For beasts that meet me run away for fear
HELENA:
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
HELENA:
Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
HELENA:
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
HELENA:
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
HELENA:
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
HELENA:
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
HELENA:
Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
LYSANDER:
[Awaking]  And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
LYSANDER:
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
LYSANDER:
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
LYSANDER:
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
LYSANDER:
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
HELENA:
Do not say so, Lysander, say not so
HELENA:
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
HELENA:
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
LYSANDER:
Content with Hermia! No, I do repent
LYSANDER:
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
LYSANDER:
Not Hermia but Helena I love
LYSANDER:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
LYSANDER:
The will of man is by his reason sway'd,
LYSANDER:
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
LYSANDER:
Things growing are not ripe until their season
LYSANDER:
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason,
LYSANDER:
And touching now the point of human skill,
LYSANDER:
Reason becomes the marshal to my will
LYSANDER:
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
LYSANDER:
Love's stories written in love's richest book.
HELENA:
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
HELENA:
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
HELENA:
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
HELENA:
That I did never, no, nor never can,
HELENA:
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
HELENA:
But you must flout my insufficiency?
HELENA:
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
HELENA:
In such disdainful manner me to woo.
HELENA:
But fare you well: perforce I must confess
HELENA:
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
HELENA:
O, that a lady, of one man refused.
HELENA:
Should of another therefore be abused!
HELENA:
Exit
LYSANDER:
She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there
LYSANDER:
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
LYSANDER:
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
LYSANDER:
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
LYSANDER:
Or as tie heresies that men do leave
LYSANDER:
Are hated most of those they did deceive,
LYSANDER:
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
LYSANDER:
Of all be hated, but the most of me!
LYSANDER:
And, all my powers, address your love and might
LYSANDER:
To honour Helen and to be her knight!
LYSANDER:
Exit
HERMIA:
[Awaking]  Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
HERMIA:
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
HERMIA:
Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
HERMIA:
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear
HERMIA:
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
HERMIA:
And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
HERMIA:
Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
HERMIA:
What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
HERMIA:
Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear,
HERMIA:
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
HERMIA:
No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
HERMIA:
Either death or you I'll find immediately.
HERMIA:
Exit
HERMIA:
ACT III
HERMIA:
SCENE I. The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.
HERMIA:
Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
BOTTOM:
Are we all met?
QUINCE:
Pat, pat, and here's a marvellous convenient place
QUINCE:
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
QUINCE:
stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house, and we
QUINCE:
will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
BOTTOM:
Peter Quince,--
QUINCE:
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
BOTTOM:
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
BOTTOM:
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
BOTTOM:
draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies
BOTTOM:
cannot abide. How answer you that?
SNOUT:
By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
STARVELING:
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
BOTTOM:
Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
BOTTOM:
Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to
BOTTOM:
say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
BOTTOM:
Pyramus is not killed indeed, and, for the more
BOTTOM:
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
BOTTOM:
Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
BOTTOM:
out of fear.
QUINCE:
Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall be
QUINCE:
written in eight and six.
BOTTOM:
No, make it two more, let it be written in eight and eight.
SNOUT:
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
STARVELING:
I fear it, I promise you.
BOTTOM:
Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
BOTTOM:
bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
BOTTOM:
most dreadful thing, for there is not a more fearful
BOTTOM:
wild-fowl than your lion living, and we ought to
BOTTOM:
look to 't.
SNOUT:
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
BOTTOM:
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
BOTTOM:
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
BOTTOM:
must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
BOTTOM:
defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
BOTTOM:
You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
BOTTOM:
entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
BOTTOM:
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
BOTTOM:
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing, I am a
BOTTOM:
man as other men are,' and there indeed let him name
BOTTOM:
his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
QUINCE:
Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things,
QUINCE:
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber, for,
QUINCE:
you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
SNOUT:
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
BOTTOM:
A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac, find
BOTTOM:
out moonshine, find out moonshine.
QUINCE:
Yes, it doth shine that night.
BOTTOM:
Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
BOTTOM:
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
BOTTOM:
may shine in at the casement.
QUINCE:
Ay, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
QUINCE:
and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
QUINCE:
present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
QUINCE:
another thing: we must have a wall in the great
QUINCE:
chamber, for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
QUINCE:
talk through the chink of a wall.
SNOUT:
You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
BOTTOM:
Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
BOTTOM:
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
BOTTOM:
about him, to signify wall, and let him hold his
BOTTOM:
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
BOTTOM:
and Thisby whisper.
QUINCE:
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit  down,
QUINCE:
every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
QUINCE:
Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
QUINCE:
speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
QUINCE:
according to his cue.
QUINCE:
Enter PUCK behind
PUCK:
What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
PUCK:
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
PUCK:
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor,
PUCK:
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
QUINCE:
Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
BOTTOM:
Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--
QUINCE:
Odours, odours.
BOTTOM:
--odours savours sweet
BOTTOM:
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
BOTTOM:
But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
BOTTOM:
And by and by I will to thee appear.
BOTTOM:
Exit
PUCK:
A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
PUCK:
Exit
FLUTE:
Must I speak now?
QUINCE:
Ay, marry, must you, for you must understand he goes
QUINCE:
but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
FLUTE:
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
FLUTE:
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
FLUTE:
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
FLUTE:
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
FLUTE:
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
QUINCE:
'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
QUINCE:
yet, that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
QUINCE:
part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
QUINCE:
is past, it is, 'never tire.'
FLUTE:
O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
FLUTE:
never tire.
FLUTE:
Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head
BOTTOM:
If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
QUINCE:
O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,
QUINCE:
masters! fly, masters! Help!
QUINCE:
Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
PUCK:
I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
PUCK:
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier
PUCK:
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
PUCK:
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire,
PUCK:
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
PUCK:
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
PUCK:
Exit
BOTTOM:
Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
BOTTOM:
make me afeard.
BOTTOM:
Re-enter SNOUT
SNOUT:
O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?
BOTTOM:
What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
BOTTOM:
you?
BOTTOM:
Exit SNOUT
BOTTOM:
Re-enter QUINCE
QUINCE:
Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art
QUINCE:
translated.
QUINCE:
Exit
BOTTOM:
I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me,
BOTTOM:
to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
BOTTOM:
from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
BOTTOM:
and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
BOTTOM:
I am not afraid.
BOTTOM:
Sings
BOTTOM:
The ousel cock so black of hue,
BOTTOM:
With orange-tawny bill,
BOTTOM:
The throstle with his note so true,
BOTTOM:
The wren with little quill,--
TITANIA:
[Awaking]  What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
BOTTOM:
[Sings]
BOTTOM:
The finch, the sparrow and the lark,
BOTTOM:
The plain-song cuckoo gray,
BOTTOM:
Whose note full many a man doth mark,
BOTTOM:
And dares not answer nay,--
BOTTOM:
for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish
BOTTOM:
a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry
BOTTOM:
'cuckoo' never so?
TITANIA:
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again
TITANIA:
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note,
TITANIA:
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape,
TITANIA:
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
TITANIA:
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
BOTTOM:
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
BOTTOM:
for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
BOTTOM:
love keep little company together now-a-days, the
BOTTOM:
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
BOTTOM:
make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
TITANIA:
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
BOTTOM:
Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
BOTTOM:
of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
TITANIA:
Out of this wood do not desire to go
TITANIA:
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
TITANIA:
I am a spirit of no common rate,
TITANIA:
The summer still doth tend upon my state,
TITANIA:
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me,
TITANIA:
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
TITANIA:
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
TITANIA:
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep,
TITANIA:
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
TITANIA:
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
TITANIA:
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
TITANIA:
Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED
PEASEBLOSSOM:
Ready.
COBWEB:
And I.
MOTH:
And I.
MUSTARDSEED:
And I.
ALL:
Where shall we go?
TITANIA:
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman,
TITANIA:
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes,
TITANIA:
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
TITANIA:
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries,
TITANIA:
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
TITANIA:
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
TITANIA:
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
TITANIA:
To have my love to bed and to arise,
TITANIA:
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
TITANIA:
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
TITANIA:
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
PEASEBLOSSOM:
Hail, mortal!
COBWEB:
Hail!
MOTH:
Hail!
MUSTARDSEED:
Hail!
BOTTOM:
I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
BOTTOM:
worship's name.
COBWEB:
Cobweb.
BOTTOM:
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
BOTTOM:
Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
BOTTOM:
you. Your name, honest gentleman?
PEASEBLOSSOM:
Peaseblossom.
BOTTOM:
I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
BOTTOM:
mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
BOTTOM:
Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
BOTTOM:
acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?
MUSTARDSEED:
Mustardseed.
BOTTOM:
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well
BOTTOM:
that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
BOTTOM:
devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
BOTTOM:
you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
BOTTOM:
desire your more acquaintance, good Master
BOTTOM:
Mustardseed.
TITANIA:
Come, wait upon him, lead him to my bower.
TITANIA:
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye,
TITANIA:
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
TITANIA:
Lamenting some enforced chastity.
TITANIA:
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
TITANIA:
Exeunt
TITANIA:
SCENE II. Another part of the wood.
TITANIA:
Enter OBERON
OBERON:
I wonder if Titania be awaked,
OBERON:
Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
OBERON:
Which she must dote on in extremity.
OBERON:
Enter PUCK
OBERON:
Here comes my messenger.
OBERON:
How now, mad spirit!
OBERON:
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
PUCK:
My mistress with a monster is in love.
PUCK:
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
PUCK:
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
PUCK:
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
PUCK:
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
PUCK:
Were met together to rehearse a play
PUCK:
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
PUCK:
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
PUCK:
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
PUCK:
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
PUCK:
When I did him at this advantage take,
PUCK:
An ass's nole I fixed on his head
PUCK:
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
PUCK:
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
PUCK:
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
PUCK:
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
PUCK:
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
PUCK:
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
PUCK:
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly,
PUCK:
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls,
PUCK:
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
PUCK:
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
PUCK:
thus strong,
PUCK:
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong,
PUCK:
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch,
PUCK:
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
PUCK:
things catch.
PUCK:
I led them on in this distracted fear,
PUCK:
And left sweet Pyramus translated there
PUCK:
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
PUCK:
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
OBERON:
This falls out better than I could devise.
OBERON:
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
OBERON:
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
PUCK:
I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
PUCK:
And the Athenian woman by his side
PUCK:
That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
PUCK:
Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS
OBERON:
Stand close: this is the same Athenian.
PUCK:
This is the woman, but not this the man.
DEMETRIUS:
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
DEMETRIUS:
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
HERMIA:
Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse,
HERMIA:
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
HERMIA:
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
HERMIA:
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
HERMIA:
And kill me too.
HERMIA:
The sun was not so true unto the day
HERMIA:
As he to me: would he have stolen away
HERMIA:
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
HERMIA:
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
HERMIA:
May through the centre creep and so displease
HERMIA:
Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
HERMIA:
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him,
HERMIA:
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
DEMETRIUS:
So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
DEMETRIUS:
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty
DEMETRIUS:
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
DEMETRIUS:
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
HERMIA:
What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
HERMIA:
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
DEMETRIUS:
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
HERMIA:
Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
HERMIA:
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
HERMIA:
Henceforth be never number'd among men!
HERMIA:
O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
HERMIA:
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
HERMIA:
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
HERMIA:
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
HERMIA:
An adder did it, for with doubler tongue
HERMIA:
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
DEMETRIUS:
You spend your passion on a misprised mood
DEMETRIUS:
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood,
DEMETRIUS:
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
HERMIA:
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
DEMETRIUS:
An if I could, what should I get therefore?
HERMIA:
A privilege never to see me more.
HERMIA:
And from thy hated presence part I so
HERMIA:
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
HERMIA:
Exit
DEMETRIUS:
There is no following her in this fierce vein
DEMETRIUS:
Here therefore for a while I will remain.
DEMETRIUS:
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
DEMETRIUS:
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
DEMETRIUS:
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
DEMETRIUS:
If for his tender here I make some stay.
DEMETRIUS:
Lies down and sleeps
OBERON:
What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
OBERON:
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight
OBERON:
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
OBERON:
Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.
PUCK:
Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
PUCK:
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
OBERON:
About the wood go swifter than the wind,
OBERON:
And Helena of Athens look thou find
OBERON:
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
OBERON:
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear
OBERON:
By some illusion see thou bring her here
OBERON:
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
PUCK:
I go, I go, look how I go,
PUCK:
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
PUCK:
Exit
OBERON:
Flower of this purple dye,
OBERON:
Hit with Cupid's archery,
OBERON:
Sink in apple of his eye.
OBERON:
When his love he doth espy,
OBERON:
Let her shine as gloriously
OBERON:
As the Venus of the sky.
OBERON:
When thou wakest, if she be by,
OBERON:
Beg of her for remedy.
OBERON:
Re-enter PUCK
PUCK:
Captain of our fairy band,
PUCK:
Helena is here at hand,
PUCK:
And the youth, mistook by me,
PUCK:
Pleading for a lover's fee.
PUCK:
Shall we their fond pageant see?
PUCK:
Lord, what fools these mortals be!
OBERON:
Stand aside: the noise they make
OBERON:
Will cause Demetrius to awake.
PUCK:
Then will two at once woo one,
PUCK:
That must needs be sport alone,
PUCK:
And those things do best please me
PUCK:
That befal preposterously.
PUCK:
Enter LYSANDER and HELENA
LYSANDER:
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
LYSANDER:
Scorn and derision never come in tears
LYSANDER:
Look, when I vow, I weep, and vows so born,
LYSANDER:
In their nativity all truth appears.
LYSANDER:
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
LYSANDER:
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
HELENA:
You do advance your cunning more and more.
HELENA:
When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
HELENA:
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
HELENA:
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh
HELENA:
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
HELENA:
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.
LYSANDER:
I had no judgment when to her I swore.
HELENA:
Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
LYSANDER:
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
DEMETRIUS:
[Awaking]  O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
DEMETRIUS:
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
DEMETRIUS:
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
DEMETRIUS:
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
DEMETRIUS:
That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
DEMETRIUS:
Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
DEMETRIUS:
When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
DEMETRIUS:
This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
HELENA:
O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
HELENA:
To set against me for your merriment
HELENA:
If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
HELENA:
You would not do me thus much injury.
HELENA:
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
HELENA:
But you must join in souls to mock me too?
HELENA:
If you were men, as men you are in show,
HELENA:
You would not use a gentle lady so,
HELENA:
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
HELENA:
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
HELENA:
You both are rivals, and love Hermia,
HELENA:
And now both rivals, to mock Helena
HELENA:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
HELENA:
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
HELENA:
With your derision! none of noble sort
HELENA:
Would so offend a virgin, and extort
HELENA:
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
LYSANDER:
You are unkind, Demetrius, be not so,
LYSANDER:
For you love Hermia, this you know I know
LYSANDER:
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
LYSANDER:
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part,
LYSANDER:
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
LYSANDER:
Whom I do love and will do till my death.
HELENA:
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
DEMETRIUS:
Lysander, keep thy Hermia, I will none
DEMETRIUS:
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
DEMETRIUS:
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
DEMETRIUS:
And now to Helen is it home return'd,
DEMETRIUS:
There to remain.
LYSANDER:
Helen, it is not so.
DEMETRIUS:
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
DEMETRIUS:
Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
DEMETRIUS:
Look, where thy love comes, yonder is thy dear.
DEMETRIUS:
Re-enter HERMIA
HERMIA:
Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
HERMIA:
The ear more quick of apprehension makes,
HERMIA:
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
HERMIA:
It pays the hearing double recompense.
HERMIA:
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found,
HERMIA:
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
HERMIA:
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
LYSANDER:
Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?
HERMIA:
What love could press Lysander from my side?
LYSANDER:
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
LYSANDER:
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
LYSANDER:
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
LYSANDER:
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
LYSANDER:
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
HERMIA:
You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
HELENA:
Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
HELENA:
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
HELENA:
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
HELENA:
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
HELENA:
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
HELENA:
To bait me with this foul derision?
HELENA:
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
HELENA:
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
HELENA:
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
HELENA:
For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
HELENA:
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
HELENA:
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
HELENA:
Have with our needles created both one flower,
HELENA:
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
HELENA:
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
HELENA:
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
HELENA:
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
HELENA:
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
HELENA:
But yet an union in partition,
HELENA:
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem,
HELENA:
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart,
HELENA:
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
HELENA:
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
HELENA:
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
HELENA:
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
HELENA:
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly
HELENA:
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
HELENA:
Though I alone do feel the injury.
HERMIA:
I am amazed at your passionate words.
HERMIA:
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
HELENA:
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
HELENA:
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
HELENA:
And made your other love, Demetrius,
HELENA:
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
HELENA:
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
HELENA:
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
HELENA:
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
HELENA:
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
HELENA:
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
HELENA:
But by your setting on, by your consent?
HELENA:
What thought I be not so in grace as you,
HELENA:
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
HELENA:
But miserable most, to love unloved?
HELENA:
This you should pity rather than despise.
HERNIA:
I understand not what you mean by this.
HELENA:
Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
HELENA:
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,
HELENA:
Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up
HELENA:
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
HELENA:
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
HELENA:
You would not make me such an argument.
HELENA:
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault,
HELENA:
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
LYSANDER:
Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse
LYSANDER:
My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!
HELENA:
O excellent!
HERMIA:
Sweet, do not scorn her so.
DEMETRIUS:
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
LYSANDER:
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat
LYSANDER:
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
LYSANDER:
Helen, I love thee, by my life, I do
LYSANDER:
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
LYSANDER:
To prove him false that says I love thee not.
DEMETRIUS:
I say I love thee more than he can do.
LYSANDER:
If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
DEMETRIUS:
Quick, come!
HERMIA:
Lysander, whereto tends all this?
LYSANDER:
Away, you Ethiope!
DEMETRIUS:
No, no, he'll [        ]
DEMETRIUS:
Seem to break loose, take on as you would follow,
DEMETRIUS:
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!
LYSANDER:
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
LYSANDER:
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!
HERMIA:
Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
HERMIA:
Sweet love,--
LYSANDER:
Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
LYSANDER:
Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!
HERMIA:
Do you not jest?
HELENA:
Yes, sooth, and so do you.
LYSANDER:
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
DEMETRIUS:
I would I had your bond, for I perceive
DEMETRIUS:
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
LYSANDER:
What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
LYSANDER:
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
HERMIA:
What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
HERMIA:
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
HERMIA:
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
HERMIA:
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
HERMIA:
Since night you loved me, yet since night you left
HERMIA:
me
HERMIA:
Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
HERMIA:
In earnest, shall I say?
LYSANDER:
Ay, by my life,
LYSANDER:
And never did desire to see thee more.
LYSANDER:
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt,
LYSANDER:
Be certain, nothing truer, 'tis no jest
LYSANDER:
That I do hate thee and love Helena.
HERMIA:
O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
HERMIA:
You thief of love! what, have you come by night
HERMIA:
And stolen my love's heart from him?
HELENA:
Fine, i'faith!
HELENA:
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
HELENA:
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
HELENA:
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
HELENA:
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
HERMIA:
Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
HERMIA:
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
HERMIA:
Between our statures, she hath urged her height,
HERMIA:
And with her personage, her tall personage,
HERMIA:
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
HERMIA:
And are you grown so high in his esteem,
HERMIA:
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
HERMIA:
How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak,
HERMIA:
How low am I? I am not yet so low
HERMIA:
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
HELENA:
I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
HELENA:
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst,
HELENA:
I have no gift at all in shrewishness,
HELENA:
I am a right maid for my cowardice
HELENA:
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
HELENA:
Because she is something lower than myself,
HELENA:
That I can match her.
HERMIA:
Lower! hark, again.
HELENA:
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
HELENA:
I evermore did love you, Hermia,
HELENA:
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you,
HELENA:
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
HELENA:
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
HELENA:
He follow'd you, for love I follow'd him,
HELENA:
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
HELENA:
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too
HELENA:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
HELENA:
To Athens will I bear my folly back
HELENA:
And follow you no further: let me go
HELENA:
You see how simple and how fond I am.
HERMIA:
Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?
HELENA:
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
HERMIA:
What, with Lysander?
HELENA:
With Demetrius.
LYSANDER:
Be not afraid, she shall not harm thee, Helena.
DEMETRIUS:
No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
HELENA:
O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
HELENA:
She was a vixen when she went to school,
HELENA:
And though she be but little, she is fierce.
HERMIA:
'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
HERMIA:
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
HERMIA:
Let me come to her.
LYSANDER:
Get you gone, you dwarf,
LYSANDER:
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made,
LYSANDER:
You bead, you acorn.
DEMETRIUS:
You are too officious
DEMETRIUS:
In her behalf that scorns your services.
DEMETRIUS:
Let her alone: speak not of Helena,
DEMETRIUS:
Take not her part, for, if thou dost intend
DEMETRIUS:
Never so little show of love to her,
DEMETRIUS:
Thou shalt aby it.
LYSANDER:
Now she holds me not,
LYSANDER:
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
LYSANDER:
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
DEMETRIUS:
Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
DEMETRIUS:
Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS
HERMIA:
You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you
HERMIA:
Nay, go not back.
HELENA:
I will not trust you, I,
HELENA:
Nor longer stay in your curst company.
HELENA:
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
HELENA:
My legs are longer though, to run away.
HELENA:
Exit
HERMIA:
I am amazed, and know not what to say.
HERMIA:
Exit
OBERON:
This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
OBERON:
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.
PUCK:
Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
PUCK:
Did not you tell me I should know the man
PUCK:
By the Athenian garment be had on?
PUCK:
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
PUCK:
That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes,
PUCK:
And so far am I glad it so did sort
PUCK:
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
OBERON:
Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight
OBERON:
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night,
OBERON:
The starry welkin cover thou anon
OBERON:
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
OBERON:
And lead these testy rivals so astray
OBERON:
As one come not within another's way.
OBERON:
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
OBERON:
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong,
OBERON:
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius,
OBERON:
And from each other look thou lead them thus,
OBERON:
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
OBERON:
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
OBERON:
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye,
OBERON:
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
OBERON:
To take from thence all error with his might,
OBERON:
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
OBERON:
When they next wake, all this derision
OBERON:
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
OBERON:
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
OBERON:
With league whose date till death shall never end.
OBERON:
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
OBERON:
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy,
OBERON:
And then I will her charmed eye release
OBERON:
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
PUCK:
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
PUCK:
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
PUCK:
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger,
PUCK:
At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
PUCK:
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
PUCK:
That in crossways and floods have burial,
PUCK:
Already to their wormy beds are gone,
PUCK:
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
PUCK:
They willfully themselves exile from light
PUCK:
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
OBERON:
But we are spirits of another sort
OBERON:
I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
OBERON:
And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
OBERON:
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
OBERON:
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
OBERON:
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
OBERON:
But, notwithstanding, haste, make no delay
OBERON:
We may effect this business yet ere day.
OBERON:
Exit
PUCK:
Up and down, up and down,
PUCK:
I will lead them up and down
PUCK:
I am fear'd in field and town
PUCK:
Goblin, lead them up and down.
PUCK:
Here comes one.
PUCK:
Re-enter LYSANDER
LYSANDER:
Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.
PUCK:
Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?
LYSANDER:
I will be with thee straight.
PUCK:
Follow me, then,
PUCK:
To plainer ground.
PUCK:
Exit LYSANDER, as following the voice
PUCK:
Re-enter DEMETRIUS
DEMETRIUS:
Lysander! speak again
DEMETRIUS:
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
DEMETRIUS:
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
PUCK:
Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
PUCK:
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
PUCK:
And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child,
PUCK:
I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
PUCK:
That draws a sword on thee.
DEMETRIUS:
Yea, art thou there?
PUCK:
Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.
PUCK:
Exeunt
PUCK:
Re-enter LYSANDER
LYSANDER:
He goes before me and still dares me on
LYSANDER:
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
LYSANDER:
The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I
LYSANDER:
I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly,
LYSANDER:
That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
LYSANDER:
And here will rest me.
LYSANDER:
Lies down
LYSANDER:
Come, thou gentle day!
LYSANDER:
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
LYSANDER:
I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
LYSANDER:
Sleeps
LYSANDER:
Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS
PUCK:
Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?
DEMETRIUS:
Abide me, if thou darest, for well I wot
DEMETRIUS:
Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
DEMETRIUS:
And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
DEMETRIUS:
Where art thou now?
PUCK:
Come hither: I am here.
DEMETRIUS:
Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
DEMETRIUS:
If ever I thy face by daylight see
DEMETRIUS:
Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
DEMETRIUS:
To measure out my length on this cold bed.
DEMETRIUS:
By day's approach look to be visited.
DEMETRIUS:
Lies down and sleeps
DEMETRIUS:
Re-enter HELENA
HELENA:
O weary night, O long and tedious night,
HELENA:
Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,
HELENA:
That I may back to Athens by daylight,
HELENA:
From these that my poor company detest
HELENA:
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
HELENA:
Steal me awhile from mine own company.
HELENA:
Lies down and sleeps
PUCK:
Yet but three? Come one more,
PUCK:
Two of both kinds make up four.
PUCK:
Here she comes, curst and sad
PUCK:
Cupid is a knavish lad,
PUCK:
Thus to make poor females mad.
PUCK:
Re-enter HERMIA
HERMIA:
Never so weary, never so in woe,
HERMIA:
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
HERMIA:
I can no further crawl, no further go,
HERMIA:
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
HERMIA:
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
HERMIA:
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
HERMIA:
Lies down and sleeps
PUCK:
On the ground
PUCK:
Sleep sound
PUCK:
I'll apply
PUCK:
To your eye,
PUCK:
Gentle lover, remedy.
PUCK:
Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes
PUCK:
When thou wakest,
PUCK:
Thou takest
PUCK:
True delight
PUCK:
In the sight
PUCK:
Of thy former lady's eye
PUCK:
And the country proverb known,
PUCK:
That every man should take his own,
PUCK:
In your waking shall be shown
PUCK:
Jack shall have Jill,
PUCK:
Nought shall go ill,
PUCK:
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.
PUCK:
Exit
PUCK:
ACT IV
PUCK:
SCENE I. The same. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA
PUCK:
lying asleep.
PUCK:
Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM, PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH,  MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending, OBERON behind unseen
TITANIA:
Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
TITANIA:
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
TITANIA:
And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
TITANIA:
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
BOTTOM:
Where's Peaseblossom?
PEASEBLOSSOM:
Ready.
BOTTOM:
Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?
COBWEB:
Ready.
BOTTOM:
Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
BOTTOM:
weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
BOTTOM:
humble-bee on the top of a thistle, and, good
BOTTOM:
mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
BOTTOM:
yourself too much in the action, mounsieur, and,
BOTTOM:
good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not,
BOTTOM:
I would be loath to have you overflown with a
BOTTOM:
honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?
MUSTARDSEED:
Ready.
BOTTOM:
Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
BOTTOM:
leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.
MUSTARDSEED:
What's your Will?
BOTTOM:
Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
BOTTOM:
to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur, for
BOTTOM:
methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face, and I
BOTTOM:
am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
BOTTOM:
I must scratch.
TITANIA:
What, wilt thou hear some music,
TITANIA:
my sweet love?
BOTTOM:
I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
BOTTOM:
the tongs and the bones.
TITANIA:
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
BOTTOM:
Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
BOTTOM:
dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
BOTTOM:
of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
TITANIA:
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
TITANIA:
The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
BOTTOM:
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
BOTTOM:
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
BOTTOM:
have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
TITANIA:
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
TITANIA:
Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
TITANIA:
Exeunt fairies
TITANIA:
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
TITANIA:
Gently entwist, the female ivy so
TITANIA:
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
TITANIA:
O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
TITANIA:
They sleep
TITANIA:
Enter PUCK
OBERON:
[Advancing]  Welcome, good Robin.
OBERON:
See'st thou this sweet sight?
OBERON:
Her dotage now I do begin to pity
OBERON:
For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
OBERON:
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
OBERON:
I did upbraid her and fall out with her,
OBERON:
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
OBERON:
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers,
OBERON:
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
OBERON:
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
OBERON:
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
OBERON:
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
OBERON:
When I had at my pleasure taunted her
OBERON:
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
OBERON:
I then did ask of her her changeling child,
OBERON:
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
OBERON:
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
OBERON:
And now I have the boy, I will undo
OBERON:
This hateful imperfection of her eyes
OBERON:
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
OBERON:
From off the head of this Athenian swain,
OBERON:
That, he awaking when the other do,
OBERON:
May all to Athens back again repair
OBERON:
And think no more of this night's accidents
OBERON:
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
OBERON:
But first I will release the fairy queen.
OBERON:
Be as thou wast wont to be,
OBERON:
See as thou wast wont to see
OBERON:
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
OBERON:
Hath such force and blessed power.
OBERON:
Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.
TITANIA:
My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
TITANIA:
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
OBERON:
There lies your love.
TITANIA:
How came these things to pass?
TITANIA:
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
OBERON:
Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
OBERON:
Titania, music call, and strike more dead
OBERON:
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
TITANIA:
Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
TITANIA:
Music, still
PUCK:
Now, when thou wakest, with thine
PUCK:
own fool's eyes peep.
OBERON:
Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
OBERON:
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
OBERON:
Now thou and I are new in amity,
OBERON:
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
OBERON:
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
OBERON:
And bless it to all fair prosperity
OBERON:
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
OBERON:
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
PUCK:
Fairy king, attend, and mark
PUCK:
I do hear the morning lark.
OBERON:
Then, my queen, in silence sad,
OBERON:
Trip we after the night's shade
OBERON:
We the globe can compass soon,
OBERON:
Swifter than the wandering moon.
TITANIA:
Come, my lord, and in our flight
TITANIA:
Tell me how it came this night
TITANIA:
That I sleeping here was found
TITANIA:
With these mortals on the ground.
TITANIA:
Exeunt
TITANIA:
Horns winded within
TITANIA:
Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train
THESEUS:
Go, one of you, find out the forester,
THESEUS:
For now our observation is perform'd,
THESEUS:
And since we have the vaward of the day,
THESEUS:
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
THESEUS:
Uncouple in the western valley, let them go
THESEUS:
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
THESEUS:
Exit an Attendant
THESEUS:
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
THESEUS:
And mark the musical confusion
THESEUS:
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
HIPPOLYTA:
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
HIPPOLYTA:
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
HIPPOLYTA:
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
HIPPOLYTA:
Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
HIPPOLYTA:
The skies, the fountains, every region near
HIPPOLYTA:
Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
HIPPOLYTA:
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
THESEUS:
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
THESEUS:
So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
THESEUS:
With ears that sweep away the morning dew,
THESEUS:
Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls,
THESEUS:
Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
THESEUS:
Each under each. A cry more tuneable
THESEUS:
Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
THESEUS:
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly
THESEUS:
Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?
EGEUS:
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep,
EGEUS:
And this, Lysander, this Demetrius is,
EGEUS:
This Helena, old Nedar's Helena
EGEUS:
I wonder of their being here together.
THESEUS:
No doubt they rose up early to observe
THESEUS:
The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
THESEUS:
Came here in grace our solemnity.
THESEUS:
But speak, Egeus, is not this the day
THESEUS:
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
EGEUS:
It is, my lord.
THESEUS:
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
THESEUS:
Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up
THESEUS:
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past
THESEUS:
Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
LYSANDER:
Pardon, my lord.
THESEUS:
I pray you all, stand up.
THESEUS:
I know you two are rival enemies
THESEUS:
How comes this gentle concord in the world,
THESEUS:
That hatred is so far from jealousy,
THESEUS:
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
LYSANDER:
My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
LYSANDER:
Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
LYSANDER:
I cannot truly say how I came here,
LYSANDER:
But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
LYSANDER:
And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
LYSANDER:
I came with Hermia hither: our intent
LYSANDER:
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
LYSANDER:
Without the peril of the Athenian law.
EGEUS:
Enough, enough, my lord, you have enough
EGEUS:
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
EGEUS:
They would have stolen away, they would, Demetrius,
EGEUS:
Thereby to have defeated you and me,
EGEUS:
You of your wife and me of my consent,
EGEUS:
Of my consent that she should be your wife.
DEMETRIUS:
My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
DEMETRIUS:
Of this their purpose hither to this wood,
DEMETRIUS:
And I in fury hither follow'd them,
DEMETRIUS:
Fair Helena in fancy following me.
DEMETRIUS:
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
DEMETRIUS:
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
DEMETRIUS:
Melted as the snow, seems to me now
DEMETRIUS:
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
DEMETRIUS:
Which in my childhood I did dote upon,
DEMETRIUS:
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
DEMETRIUS:
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
DEMETRIUS:
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
DEMETRIUS:
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia
DEMETRIUS:
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food,
DEMETRIUS:
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
DEMETRIUS:
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
DEMETRIUS:
And will for evermore be true to it.
THESEUS:
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met
THESEUS:
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
THESEUS:
Egeus, I will overbear your will,
THESEUS:
For in the temple by and by with us
THESEUS:
These couples shall eternally be knit
THESEUS:
And, for the morning now is something worn,
THESEUS:
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
THESEUS:
Away with us to Athens, three and three,
THESEUS:
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
THESEUS:
Come, Hippolyta.
THESEUS:
Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train
DEMETRIUS:
These things seem small and undistinguishable,
HERMIA:
Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
HERMIA:
When every thing seems double.
HELENA:
So methinks
HELENA:
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
HELENA:
Mine own, and not mine own.
DEMETRIUS:
Are you sure
DEMETRIUS:
That we are awake? It seems to me
DEMETRIUS:
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
DEMETRIUS:
The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
HERMIA:
Yea, and my father.
HELENA:
And Hippolyta.
LYSANDER:
And he did bid us follow to the temple.
DEMETRIUS:
Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
DEMETRIUS:
And by the way let us recount our dreams.
DEMETRIUS:
Exeunt
BOTTOM:
[Awaking]  When my cue comes, call me, and I will
BOTTOM:
answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!
BOTTOM:
Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
BOTTOM:
the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen
BOTTOM:
hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
BOTTOM:
vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to
BOTTOM:
say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go
BOTTOM:
about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
BOTTOM:
is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and
BOTTOM:
methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if
BOTTOM:
he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
BOTTOM:
of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
BOTTOM:
seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue
BOTTOM:
to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
BOTTOM:
was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
BOTTOM:
this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,
BOTTOM:
because it hath no bottom, and I will sing it in the
BOTTOM:
latter end of a play, before the duke
BOTTOM:
peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
BOTTOM:
sing it at her death.
BOTTOM:
Exit
BOTTOM:
SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.
BOTTOM:
Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
QUINCE:
Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home yet?
STARVELING:
He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
STARVELING:
transported.
FLUTE:
If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
FLUTE:
not forward, doth it?
QUINCE:
It is not possible: you have not a man in all
QUINCE:
Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
FLUTE:
No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
FLUTE:
man in Athens.
QUINCE:
Yea and the best person too, and he is a very
QUINCE:
paramour for a sweet voice.
FLUTE:
You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
FLUTE:
a thing of naught.
FLUTE:
Enter SNUG
SNUG:
Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and
SNUG:
there is two or three lords and ladies more married
SNUG:
if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made
SNUG:
men.
FLUTE:
O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
FLUTE:
day during his life, he could not have 'scaped
FLUTE:
sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
FLUTE:
sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged,
FLUTE:
he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
FLUTE:
Pyramus, or nothing.
FLUTE:
Enter BOTTOM
BOTTOM:
Where are these lads? where are these hearts?
QUINCE:
Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
BOTTOM:
Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
BOTTOM:
what, for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
BOTTOM:
will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.
QUINCE:
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
BOTTOM:
Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
BOTTOM:
the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
BOTTOM:
good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
BOTTOM:
pumps, meet presently at the palace, every man look
BOTTOM:
o'er his part, for the short and the long is, our
BOTTOM:
play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
BOTTOM:
clean linen, and let not him that plays the lion
BOTTOM:
pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
BOTTOM:
lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
BOTTOM:
nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath, and I
BOTTOM:
do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
BOTTOM:
comedy. No more words: away! go, away!
BOTTOM:
Exeunt
BOTTOM:
ACT V
BOTTOM:
SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.
BOTTOM:
Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and Attendants
HIPPOLYTA:
'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
HIPPOLYTA:
lovers speak of.
THESEUS:
More strange than true: I never may believe
THESEUS:
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
THESEUS:
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
THESEUS:
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
THESEUS:
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
THESEUS:
The lunatic, the lover and the poet
THESEUS:
Are of imagination all compact
THESEUS:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
THESEUS:
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
THESEUS:
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt
THESEUS:
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
THESEUS:
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,
THESEUS:
And as imagination bodies forth
THESEUS:
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
THESEUS:
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
THESEUS:
A local habitation and a name.
THESEUS:
Such tricks hath strong imagination,
THESEUS:
That if it would but apprehend some joy,
THESEUS:
It comprehends some bringer of that joy,
THESEUS:
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
THESEUS:
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
HIPPOLYTA:
But all the story of the night told over,
HIPPOLYTA:
And all their minds transfigured so together,
HIPPOLYTA:
More witnesseth than fancy's images
HIPPOLYTA:
And grows to something of great constancy,
HIPPOLYTA:
But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
THESEUS:
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
THESEUS:
Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA
THESEUS:
Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
THESEUS:
Accompany your hearts!
LYSANDER:
More than to us
LYSANDER:
Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
THESEUS:
Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have,
THESEUS:
To wear away this long age of three hours
THESEUS:
Between our after-supper and bed-time?
THESEUS:
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
THESEUS:
What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
THESEUS:
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
THESEUS:
Call Philostrate.
PHILOSTRATE:
Here, mighty Theseus.
THESEUS:
Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
THESEUS:
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
THESEUS:
The lazy time, if not with some delight?
PHILOSTRATE:
There is a brief how many sports are ripe
PHILOSTRATE:
Make choice of which your highness will see first.
PHILOSTRATE:
Giving a paper
THESEUS:
[Reads]  'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
THESEUS:
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
THESEUS:
We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
THESEUS:
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
THESEUS:
Reads
THESEUS:
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
THESEUS:
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
THESEUS:
That is an old device, and it was play'd
THESEUS:
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
THESEUS:
Reads
THESEUS:
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
THESEUS:
Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
THESEUS:
That is some satire, keen and critical,
THESEUS:
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
THESEUS:
Reads
THESEUS:
'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
THESEUS:
And his love Thisbe, very tragical mirth.'
THESEUS:
Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
THESEUS:
That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
THESEUS:
How shall we find the concord of this discord?
PHILOSTRATE:
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
PHILOSTRATE:
Which is as brief as I have known a play,
PHILOSTRATE:
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
PHILOSTRATE:
Which makes it tedious, for in all the play
PHILOSTRATE:
There is not one word apt, one player fitted
PHILOSTRATE:
And tragical, my noble lord, it is,
PHILOSTRATE:
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
PHILOSTRATE:
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
PHILOSTRATE:
Made mine eyes water, but more merry tears
PHILOSTRATE:
The passion of loud laughter never shed.
THESEUS:
What are they that do play it?
PHILOSTRATE:
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
PHILOSTRATE:
Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
PHILOSTRATE:
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
PHILOSTRATE:
With this same play, against your nuptial.
THESEUS:
And we will hear it.
PHILOSTRATE:
No, my noble lord,
PHILOSTRATE:
It is not for you: I have heard it over,
PHILOSTRATE:
And it is nothing, nothing in the world,
PHILOSTRATE:
Unless you can find sport in their intents,
PHILOSTRATE:
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
PHILOSTRATE:
To do you service.
THESEUS:
I will hear that play,
THESEUS:
For never anything can be amiss,
THESEUS:
When simpleness and duty tender it.
THESEUS:
Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.
THESEUS:
Exit PHILOSTRATE
HIPPOLYTA:
I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
HIPPOLYTA:
And duty in his service perishing.
THESEUS:
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
HIPPOLYTA:
He says they can do nothing in this kind.
THESEUS:
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
THESEUS:
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake
THESEUS:
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
THESEUS:
Takes it in might, not merit.
THESEUS:
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
THESEUS:
To greet me with premeditated welcomes,
THESEUS:
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
THESEUS:
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
THESEUS:
Throttle their practised accent in their fears
THESEUS:
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
THESEUS:
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
THESEUS:
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome,
THESEUS:
And in the modesty of fearful duty
THESEUS:
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
THESEUS:
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
THESEUS:
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
THESEUS:
In least speak most, to my capacity.
THESEUS:
Re-enter PHILOSTRATE
PHILOSTRATE:
So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.
THESEUS:
Let him approach.
THESEUS:
Flourish of trumpets
THESEUS:
Enter QUINCE for the Prologue
Prologue:
If we offend, it is with our good will.
Prologue:
That you should think, we come not to offend,
Prologue:
But with good will. To show our simple skill,
Prologue:
That is the true beginning of our end.
Prologue:
Consider then we come but in despite.
Prologue:
We do not come as minding to contest you,
Prologue:
Our true intent is. All for your delight
Prologue:
We are not here. That you should here repent you,
Prologue:
The actors are at hand and by their show
Prologue:
You shall know all that you are like to know.
THESEUS:
This fellow doth not stand upon points.
LYSANDER:
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt, he knows
LYSANDER:
not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
LYSANDER:
enough to speak, but to speak true.
HIPPOLYTA:
Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
HIPPOLYTA:
on a recorder, a sound, but not in government.
THESEUS:
His speech, was like a tangled chain, nothing
THESEUS:
impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
THESEUS:
Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion
Prologue:
Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show,
Prologue:
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
Prologue:
This man is Pyramus, if you would know,
Prologue:
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
Prologue:
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Prologue:
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder,
Prologue:
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
Prologue:
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
Prologue:
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
Prologue:
Presenteth Moonshine, for, if you will know,
Prologue:
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
Prologue:
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
Prologue:
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
Prologue:
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Prologue:
Did scare away, or rather did affright,
Prologue:
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
Prologue:
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Prologue:
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
Prologue:
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain
Prologue:
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
Prologue:
He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast,
Prologue:
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
Prologue:
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Prologue:
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
Prologue:
At large discourse, while here they do remain.
Prologue:
Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine
THESEUS:
I wonder if the lion be to speak.
DEMETRIUS:
No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
Wall:
In this same interlude it doth befall
Wall:
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall,
Wall:
And such a wall, as I would have you think,
Wall:
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Wall:
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Wall:
Did whisper often very secretly.
Wall:
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
Wall:
That I am that same wall, the truth is so
Wall:
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Wall:
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
THESEUS:
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
DEMETRIUS:
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
DEMETRIUS:
discourse, my lord.
DEMETRIUS:
Enter Pyramus
THESEUS:
Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!
Pyramus:
O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
Pyramus:
O night, which ever art when day is not!
Pyramus:
O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
Pyramus:
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
Pyramus:
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
Pyramus:
That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
Pyramus:
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
Pyramus:
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
Pyramus:
Wall holds up his fingers
Pyramus:
Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
Pyramus:
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
Pyramus:
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
Pyramus:
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
THESEUS:
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
Pyramus:
No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
Pyramus:
is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
Pyramus:
spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
Pyramus:
fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
Pyramus:
Enter Thisbe
Thisbe:
O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
Thisbe:
For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
Thisbe:
My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
Thisbe:
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
Pyramus:
I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
Pyramus:
To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!
Thisbe:
My love thou art, my love I think.
Pyramus:
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace,
Pyramus:
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.
Thisbe:
And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
Pyramus:
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
Thisbe:
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
Pyramus:
O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
Thisbe:
I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
Pyramus:
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
Thisbe:
'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.
Thisbe:
Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe
Wall:
Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so,
Wall:
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
Wall:
Exit
THESEUS:
Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
DEMETRIUS:
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
DEMETRIUS:
without warning.
HIPPOLYTA:
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
THESEUS:
The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst
THESEUS:
are no worse, if imagination amend them.
HIPPOLYTA:
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
THESEUS:
If we imagine no worse of them than they of
THESEUS:
themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
THESEUS:
come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
THESEUS:
Enter Lion and Moonshine
Lion:
You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
Lion:
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
Lion:
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
Lion:
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
Lion:
Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
Lion:
A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam,
Lion:
For, if I should as lion come in strife
Lion:
Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
THESEUS:
A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
DEMETRIUS:
The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
LYSANDER:
This lion is a very fox for his valour.
THESEUS:
True, and a goose for his discretion.
DEMETRIUS:
Not so, my lord, for his valour cannot carry his
DEMETRIUS:
discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
THESEUS:
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour,
THESEUS:
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well
THESEUS:
leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
Moonshine:
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present,--
DEMETRIUS:
He should have worn the horns on his head.
THESEUS:
He is no crescent, and his horns are
THESEUS:
invisible within the circumference.
Moonshine:
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present,
Moonshine:
Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
THESEUS:
This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
THESEUS:
should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
THESEUS:
man i' the moon?
DEMETRIUS:
He dares not come there for the candle, for, you
DEMETRIUS:
see, it is already in snuff.
HIPPOLYTA:
I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
THESEUS:
It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
THESEUS:
he is in the wane, but yet, in courtesy, in all
THESEUS:
reason, we must stay the time.
LYSANDER:
Proceed, Moon.
Moonshine:
All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
Moonshine:
lanthorn is the moon, I, the man in the moon, this
Moonshine:
thorn-bush, my thorn-bush, and this dog, my dog.
DEMETRIUS:
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn, for all
DEMETRIUS:
these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.
DEMETRIUS:
Enter Thisbe
Thisbe:
This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
Lion:
[Roaring]  Oh--
Lion:
Thisbe runs off
DEMETRIUS:
Well roared, Lion.
THESEUS:
Well run, Thisbe.
HIPPOLYTA:
Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
HIPPOLYTA:
good grace.
HIPPOLYTA:
The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit
THESEUS:
Well moused, Lion.
LYSANDER:
And so the lion vanished.
DEMETRIUS:
And then came Pyramus.
DEMETRIUS:
Enter Pyramus
Pyramus:
Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams,
Pyramus:
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright,
Pyramus:
For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
Pyramus:
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
Pyramus:
But stay, O spite!
Pyramus:
But mark, poor knight,
Pyramus:
What dreadful dole is here!
Pyramus:
Eyes, do you see?
Pyramus:
How can it be?
Pyramus:
O dainty duck! O dear!
Pyramus:
Thy mantle good,
Pyramus:
What, stain'd with blood!
Pyramus:
Approach, ye Furies fell!
Pyramus:
O Fates, come, come,
Pyramus:
Cut thread and thrum,
Pyramus:
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
THESEUS:
This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
THESEUS:
go near to make a man look sad.
HIPPOLYTA:
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
Pyramus:
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Pyramus:
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear
Pyramus:
Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
Pyramus:
That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
Pyramus:
with cheer.
Pyramus:
Come, tears, confound,
Pyramus:
Out, sword, and wound
Pyramus:
The pap of Pyramus,
Pyramus:
Ay, that left pap,
Pyramus:
Where heart doth hop
Pyramus:
Stabs himself
Pyramus:
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Pyramus:
Now am I dead,
Pyramus:
Now am I fled,
Pyramus:
My soul is in the sky
Pyramus:
Tongue, lose thy light,
Pyramus:
Moon take thy flight
Pyramus:
Exit Moonshine
Pyramus:
Now die, die, die, die, die.
Pyramus:
Dies
DEMETRIUS:
No die, but an ace, for him, for he is but one.
LYSANDER:
Less than an ace, man, for he is dead, he is nothing.
THESEUS:
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
THESEUS:
prove an ass.
HIPPOLYTA:
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
HIPPOLYTA:
back and finds her lover?
THESEUS:
She will find him by starlight. Here she comes, and
THESEUS:
her passion ends the play.
THESEUS:
Re-enter Thisbe
HIPPOLYTA:
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
HIPPOLYTA:
Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
DEMETRIUS:
A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
DEMETRIUS:
Thisbe, is the better, he for a man, God warrant us,
DEMETRIUS:
she for a woman, God bless us.
LYSANDER:
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
DEMETRIUS:
And thus she means, videlicet:--
Thisbe:
Asleep, my love?
Thisbe:
What, dead, my dove?
Thisbe:
O Pyramus, arise!
Thisbe:
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
Thisbe:
Dead, dead? A tomb
Thisbe:
Must cover thy sweet eyes.
Thisbe:
These My lips,
Thisbe:
This cherry nose,
Thisbe:
These yellow cowslip cheeks,
Thisbe:
Are gone, are gone
Thisbe:
Lovers, make moan
Thisbe:
His eyes were green as leeks.
Thisbe:
O Sisters Three,
Thisbe:
Come, come to me,
Thisbe:
With hands as pale as milk,
Thisbe:
Lay them in gore,
Thisbe:
Since you have shore
Thisbe:
With shears his thread of silk.
Thisbe:
Tongue, not a word
Thisbe:
Come, trusty sword,
Thisbe:
Come, blade, my breast imbrue
Thisbe:
Stabs herself
Thisbe:
And, farewell, friends,
Thisbe:
Thus Thisby ends
Thisbe:
Adieu, adieu, adieu.
Thisbe:
Dies
THESEUS:
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
DEMETRIUS:
Ay, and Wall too.
BOTTOM:
[Starting up]  No assure you, the wall is down that
BOTTOM:
parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
BOTTOM:
epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
BOTTOM:
of our company?
THESEUS:
No epilogue, I pray you, for your play needs no
THESEUS:
excuse. Never excuse, for when the players are all
THESEUS:
dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
THESEUS:
that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
THESEUS:
in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
THESEUS:
tragedy: and so it is, truly, and very notably
THESEUS:
discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
THESEUS:
epilogue alone.
THESEUS:
A dance
THESEUS:
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
THESEUS:
Lovers, to bed, 'tis almost fairy time.
THESEUS:
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
THESEUS:
As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
THESEUS:
This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
THESEUS:
The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
THESEUS:
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
THESEUS:
In nightly revels and new jollity.
THESEUS:
Exeunt
THESEUS:
Enter PUCK
PUCK:
Now the hungry lion roars,
PUCK:
And the wolf behowls the moon,
PUCK:
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
PUCK:
All with weary task fordone.
PUCK:
Now the wasted brands do glow,
PUCK:
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
PUCK:
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
PUCK:
In remembrance of a shroud.
PUCK:
Now it is the time of night
PUCK:
That the graves all gaping wide,
PUCK:
Every one lets forth his sprite,
PUCK:
In the church-way paths to glide
PUCK:
And we fairies, that do run
PUCK:
By the triple Hecate's team,
PUCK:
From the presence of the sun,
PUCK:
Following darkness like a dream,
PUCK:
Now are frolic: not a mouse
PUCK:
Shall disturb this hallow'd house
PUCK:
I am sent with broom before,
PUCK:
To sweep the dust behind the door.
PUCK:
Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train
OBERON:
Through the house give gathering light,
OBERON:
By the dead and drowsy fire
OBERON:
Every elf and fairy sprite
OBERON:
Hop as light as bird from brier,
OBERON:
And this ditty, after me,
OBERON:
Sing, and dance it trippingly.
TITANIA:
First, rehearse your song by rote
TITANIA:
To each word a warbling note
TITANIA:
Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
TITANIA:
Will we sing, and bless this place.
TITANIA:
Song and dance
OBERON:
Now, until the break of day,
OBERON:
Through this house each fairy stray.
OBERON:
To the best bride-bed will we,
OBERON:
Which by us shall blessed be,
OBERON:
And the issue there create
OBERON:
Ever shall be fortunate.
OBERON:
So shall all the couples three
OBERON:
Ever true in loving be,
OBERON:
And the blots of Nature's hand
OBERON:
Shall not in their issue stand,
OBERON:
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
OBERON:
Nor mark prodigious, such as are
OBERON:
Despised in nativity,
OBERON:
Shall upon their children be.
OBERON:
With this field-dew consecrate,
OBERON:
Every fairy take his gait,
OBERON:
And each several chamber bless,
OBERON:
Through this palace, with sweet peace,
OBERON:
And the owner of it blest
OBERON:
Ever shall in safety rest.
OBERON:
Trip away, make no stay,
OBERON:
Meet me all by break of day.
OBERON:
Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train
PUCK:
If we shadows have offended,
PUCK:
Think but this, and all is mended,
PUCK:
That you have but slumber'd here
PUCK:
While these visions did appear.
PUCK:
And this weak and idle theme,
PUCK:
No more yielding but a dream,
PUCK:
Gentles, do not reprehend
PUCK:
if you pardon, we will mend
PUCK:
And, as I am an honest Puck,
PUCK:
If we have unearned luck
PUCK:
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
PUCK:
We will make amends ere long,
PUCK:
Else the Puck a liar call,
PUCK:
So, good night unto you all.
PUCK:
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
PUCK:
And Robin shall restore amends.
