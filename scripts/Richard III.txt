HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
ACT I
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
SCENE I. London. A street.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Enter GLOUCESTER, solus
GLOUCESTER:
Now is the winter of our discontent
GLOUCESTER:
Made glorious summer by this sun of York,
GLOUCESTER:
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
GLOUCESTER:
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
GLOUCESTER:
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
GLOUCESTER:
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,
GLOUCESTER:
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
GLOUCESTER:
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
GLOUCESTER:
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,
GLOUCESTER:
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
GLOUCESTER:
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
GLOUCESTER:
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
GLOUCESTER:
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
GLOUCESTER:
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
GLOUCESTER:
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass,
GLOUCESTER:
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
GLOUCESTER:
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph,
GLOUCESTER:
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
GLOUCESTER:
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
GLOUCESTER:
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
GLOUCESTER:
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
GLOUCESTER:
And that so lamely and unfashionable
GLOUCESTER:
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them,
GLOUCESTER:
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
GLOUCESTER:
Have no delight to pass away the time,
GLOUCESTER:
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
GLOUCESTER:
And descant on mine own deformity
GLOUCESTER:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
GLOUCESTER:
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
GLOUCESTER:
I am determined to prove a villain
GLOUCESTER:
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
GLOUCESTER:
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
GLOUCESTER:
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
GLOUCESTER:
To set my brother Clarence and the king
GLOUCESTER:
In deadly hate the one against the other
GLOUCESTER:
And if King Edward be as true and just
GLOUCESTER:
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
GLOUCESTER:
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
GLOUCESTER:
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
GLOUCESTER:
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
GLOUCESTER:
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
GLOUCESTER:
Clarence comes.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY
GLOUCESTER:
Brother, good day, what means this armed guard
GLOUCESTER:
That waits upon your grace?
CLARENCE:
His majesty
CLARENCE:
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
CLARENCE:
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
GLOUCESTER:
Upon what cause?
CLARENCE:
Because my name is George.
GLOUCESTER:
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours,
GLOUCESTER:
He should, for that, commit your godfathers
GLOUCESTER:
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
GLOUCESTER:
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
GLOUCESTER:
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
CLARENCE:
Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest
CLARENCE:
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
CLARENCE:
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
CLARENCE:
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
CLARENCE:
And says a wizard told him that by G
CLARENCE:
His issue disinherited should be,
CLARENCE:
And, for my name of George begins with G,
CLARENCE:
It follows in his thought that I am he.
CLARENCE:
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
CLARENCE:
Have moved his highness to commit me now.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower
GLOUCESTER:
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
GLOUCESTER:
That tempers him to this extremity.
GLOUCESTER:
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
GLOUCESTER:
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
GLOUCESTER:
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
GLOUCESTER:
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
GLOUCESTER:
We are not safe, Clarence, we are not safe.
CLARENCE:
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
CLARENCE:
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
CLARENCE:
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
CLARENCE:
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
CLARENCE:
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining to her deity
GLOUCESTER:
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
GLOUCESTER:
I'll tell you what, I think it is our way,
GLOUCESTER:
If we will keep in favour with the king,
GLOUCESTER:
To be her men and wear her livery
GLOUCESTER:
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
GLOUCESTER:
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
GLOUCESTER:
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your graces both to pardon me,
BRAKENBURY:
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
BRAKENBURY:
That no man shall have private conference,
BRAKENBURY:
Of what degree soever, with his brother.
GLOUCESTER:
Even so, an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
GLOUCESTER:
You may partake of any thing we say
GLOUCESTER:
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
GLOUCESTER:
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
GLOUCESTER:
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous,
GLOUCESTER:
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
GLOUCESTER:
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue,
GLOUCESTER:
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks
GLOUCESTER:
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
BRAKENBURY:
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
GLOUCESTER:
Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
GLOUCESTER:
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
GLOUCESTER:
Were best he do it secretly, alone.
BRAKENBURY:
What one, my lord?
GLOUCESTER:
Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
BRAKENBURY:
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
GLOUCESTER:
We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
GLOUCESTER:
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king,
GLOUCESTER:
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
GLOUCESTER:
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
GLOUCESTER:
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
GLOUCESTER:
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
CLARENCE:
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
GLOUCESTER:
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long,
GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, have patience.
CLARENCE:
I must perforce. Farewell.
CLARENCE:
Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard
GLOUCESTER:
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
GLOUCESTER:
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
GLOUCESTER:
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
GLOUCESTER:
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
GLOUCESTER:
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
GLOUCESTER:
Enter HASTINGS
HASTINGS:
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
GLOUCESTER:
As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
GLOUCESTER:
Well are you welcome to the open air.
GLOUCESTER:
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
HASTINGS:
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must
HASTINGS:
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
HASTINGS:
That were the cause of my imprisonment.
GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt, and so shall Clarence too,
GLOUCESTER:
For they that were your enemies are his,
GLOUCESTER:
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
HASTINGS:
More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
HASTINGS:
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
GLOUCESTER:
What news abroad?
HASTINGS:
No news so bad abroad as this at home,
HASTINGS:
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
HASTINGS:
And his physicians fear him mightily.
GLOUCESTER:
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
GLOUCESTER:
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
GLOUCESTER:
And overmuch consumed his royal person
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
GLOUCESTER:
What, is he in his bed?
HASTINGS:
He is.
GLOUCESTER:
Go you before, and I will follow you.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit HASTINGS
GLOUCESTER:
He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
GLOUCESTER:
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
GLOUCESTER:
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
GLOUCESTER:
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments,
GLOUCESTER:
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
GLOUCESTER:
Clarence hath not another day to live
GLOUCESTER:
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
GLOUCESTER:
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
GLOUCESTER:
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
GLOUCESTER:
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
GLOUCESTER:
The readiest way to make the wench amends
GLOUCESTER:
Is to become her husband and her father
GLOUCESTER:
The which will I, not all so much for love
GLOUCESTER:
As for another secret close intent,
GLOUCESTER:
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
GLOUCESTER:
But yet I run before my horse to market
GLOUCESTER:
Clarence still breathes, Edward still lives and reigns
GLOUCESTER:
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE II. The same. Another street.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen with halberds to guard it, LADY ANNE being the mourner
LADY ANNE:
Set down, set down your honourable load,
LADY ANNE:
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
LADY ANNE:
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
LADY ANNE:
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
LADY ANNE:
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
LADY ANNE:
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
LADY ANNE:
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
LADY ANNE:
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
LADY ANNE:
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
LADY ANNE:
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
LADY ANNE:
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
LADY ANNE:
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
LADY ANNE:
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
LADY ANNE:
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
LADY ANNE:
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
LADY ANNE:
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
LADY ANNE:
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
LADY ANNE:
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
LADY ANNE:
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
LADY ANNE:
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
LADY ANNE:
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
LADY ANNE:
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
LADY ANNE:
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
LADY ANNE:
May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
LADY ANNE:
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
LADY ANNE:
If ever he have wife, let her he made
LADY ANNE:
A miserable by the death of him
LADY ANNE:
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
LADY ANNE:
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
LADY ANNE:
Taken from Paul's to be interred there,
LADY ANNE:
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
LADY ANNE:
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
LADY ANNE:
Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
LADY ANNE:
What black magician conjures up this fiend,
LADY ANNE:
To stop devoted charitable deeds?
GLOUCESTER:
Villains, set down the corse, or, by Saint Paul,
GLOUCESTER:
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
Gentleman:
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
GLOUCESTER:
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command
GLOUCESTER:
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
GLOUCESTER:
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
GLOUCESTER:
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
LADY ANNE:
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
LADY ANNE:
Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
LADY ANNE:
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
LADY ANNE:
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
LADY ANNE:
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
LADY ANNE:
His soul thou canst not have, therefore be gone.
GLOUCESTER:
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
LADY ANNE:
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not,
LADY ANNE:
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
LADY ANNE:
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
LADY ANNE:
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
LADY ANNE:
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
LADY ANNE:
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
LADY ANNE:
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
LADY ANNE:
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity,
LADY ANNE:
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
LADY ANNE:
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells,
LADY ANNE:
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
LADY ANNE:
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
LADY ANNE:
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
LADY ANNE:
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
LADY ANNE:
Either heaven with lightning strike the
LADY ANNE:
murderer dead,
LADY ANNE:
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
LADY ANNE:
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
LADY ANNE:
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of charity,
GLOUCESTER:
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
LADY ANNE:
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man
LADY ANNE:
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
GLOUCESTER:
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
LADY ANNE:
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
GLOUCESTER:
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
GLOUCESTER:
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
GLOUCESTER:
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
LADY ANNE:
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
LADY ANNE:
For these known evils, but to give me leave,
LADY ANNE:
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
GLOUCESTER:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
GLOUCESTER:
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
LADY ANNE:
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
LADY ANNE:
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.
LADY ANNE:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused,
LADY ANNE:
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
LADY ANNE:
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
GLOUCESTER:
Say that I slew them not?
LADY ANNE:
Why, then they are not dead
LADY ANNE:
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your husband.
LADY ANNE:
Why, then he is alive.
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hand.
LADY ANNE:
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
LADY ANNE:
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood,
LADY ANNE:
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
LADY ANNE:
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
GLOUCESTER:
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
GLOUCESTER:
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
LADY ANNE:
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
LADY ANNE:
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries
LADY ANNE:
Didst thou not kill this king?
GLOUCESTER:
I grant ye.
LADY ANNE:
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
LADY ANNE:
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
LADY ANNE:
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
LADY ANNE:
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
GLOUCESTER:
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither,
GLOUCESTER:
For he was fitter for that place than earth.
LADY ANNE:
And thou unfit for any place but hell.
GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
LADY ANNE:
Some dungeon.
GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.
LADY ANNE:
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
GLOUCESTER:
So will it, madam till I lie with you.
LADY ANNE:
I hope so.
GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
GLOUCESTER:
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
GLOUCESTER:
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
GLOUCESTER:
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
GLOUCESTER:
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
GLOUCESTER:
As blameful as the executioner?
LADY ANNE:
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
GLOUCESTER:
Your beauty was the cause of that effect,
GLOUCESTER:
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
GLOUCESTER:
To undertake the death of all the world,
GLOUCESTER:
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
LADY ANNE:
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
LADY ANNE:
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
GLOUCESTER:
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck,
GLOUCESTER:
You should not blemish it, if I stood by
GLOUCESTER:
As all the world is cheered by the sun,
GLOUCESTER:
So I by that, it is my day, my life.
LADY ANNE:
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
GLOUCESTER:
Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
LADY ANNE:
I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
GLOUCESTER:
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
GLOUCESTER:
To be revenged on him that loveth you.
LADY ANNE:
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
LADY ANNE:
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
GLOUCESTER:
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
GLOUCESTER:
Did it to help thee to a better husband.
LADY ANNE:
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
GLOUCESTER:
He lives that loves thee better than he could.
LADY ANNE:
Name him.
GLOUCESTER:
Plantagenet.
LADY ANNE:
Why, that was he.
GLOUCESTER:
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
LADY ANNE:
Where is he?
GLOUCESTER:
Here.
GLOUCESTER:
She spitteth at him
GLOUCESTER:
Why dost thou spit at me?
LADY ANNE:
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
GLOUCESTER:
Never came poison from so sweet a place.
LADY ANNE:
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
LADY ANNE:
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
GLOUCESTER:
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
LADY ANNE:
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
GLOUCESTER:
I would they were, that I might die at once,
GLOUCESTER:
For now they kill me with a living death.
GLOUCESTER:
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
GLOUCESTER:
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops
GLOUCESTER:
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
GLOUCESTER:
No, when my father York and Edward wept,
GLOUCESTER:
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
GLOUCESTER:
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him,
GLOUCESTER:
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
GLOUCESTER:
Told the sad story of my father's death,
GLOUCESTER:
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
GLOUCESTER:
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
GLOUCESTER:
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
GLOUCESTER:
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear,
GLOUCESTER:
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
GLOUCESTER:
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
GLOUCESTER:
I never sued to friend nor enemy,
GLOUCESTER:
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word,
GLOUCESTER:
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
GLOUCESTER:
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
GLOUCESTER:
She looks scornfully at him
GLOUCESTER:
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
GLOUCESTER:
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
GLOUCESTER:
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
GLOUCESTER:
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword,
GLOUCESTER:
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
GLOUCESTER:
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
GLOUCESTER:
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
GLOUCESTER:
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
GLOUCESTER:
He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, do not pause, for I did kill King Henry,
GLOUCESTER:
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, now dispatch, 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
GLOUCESTER:
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
GLOUCESTER:
Here she lets fall the sword
GLOUCESTER:
Take up the sword again, or take up me.
LADY ANNE:
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
LADY ANNE:
I will not be the executioner.
GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
LADY ANNE:
I have already.
GLOUCESTER:
Tush, that was in thy rage
GLOUCESTER:
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
GLOUCESTER:
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
GLOUCESTER:
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love,
GLOUCESTER:
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
LADY ANNE:
I would I knew thy heart.
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figured in my tongue.
LADY ANNE:
I fear me both are false.
GLOUCESTER:
Then never man was true.
LADY ANNE:
Well, well, put up your sword.
GLOUCESTER:
Say, then, my peace is made.
LADY ANNE:
That shall you know hereafter.
GLOUCESTER:
But shall I live in hope?
LADY ANNE:
All men, I hope, live so.
GLOUCESTER:
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
LADY ANNE:
To take is not to give.
GLOUCESTER:
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
GLOUCESTER:
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart,
GLOUCESTER:
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
GLOUCESTER:
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
GLOUCESTER:
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
GLOUCESTER:
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
LADY ANNE:
What is it?
GLOUCESTER:
That it would please thee leave these sad designs
GLOUCESTER:
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
GLOUCESTER:
And presently repair to Crosby Place,
GLOUCESTER:
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
GLOUCESTER:
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
GLOUCESTER:
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
GLOUCESTER:
I will with all expedient duty see you
GLOUCESTER:
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
GLOUCESTER:
Grant me this boon.
LADY ANNE:
With all my heart, and much it joys me too,
LADY ANNE:
To see you are become so penitent.
LADY ANNE:
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell.
LADY ANNE:
'Tis more than you deserve,
LADY ANNE:
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
LADY ANNE:
Imagine I have said farewell already.
LADY ANNE:
Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY
GLOUCESTER:
Sirs, take up the corse.
GENTLEMEN:
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
GLOUCESTER:
No, to White-Friars, there attend my coining.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
GLOUCESTER:
Was ever woman in this humour won?
GLOUCESTER:
I'll have her, but I will not keep her long.
GLOUCESTER:
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
GLOUCESTER:
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
GLOUCESTER:
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
GLOUCESTER:
The bleeding witness of her hatred by,
GLOUCESTER:
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
GLOUCESTER:
against me,
GLOUCESTER:
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
GLOUCESTER:
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
GLOUCESTER:
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
GLOUCESTER:
Ha!
GLOUCESTER:
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
GLOUCESTER:
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
GLOUCESTER:
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
GLOUCESTER:
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
GLOUCESTER:
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
GLOUCESTER:
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
GLOUCESTER:
The spacious world cannot again afford
GLOUCESTER:
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
GLOUCESTER:
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
GLOUCESTER:
And made her widow to a woful bed?
GLOUCESTER:
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
GLOUCESTER:
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
GLOUCESTER:
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
GLOUCESTER:
I do mistake my person all this while
GLOUCESTER:
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
GLOUCESTER:
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
GLOUCESTER:
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
GLOUCESTER:
And entertain some score or two of tailors,
GLOUCESTER:
To study fashions to adorn my body
GLOUCESTER:
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
GLOUCESTER:
Will maintain it with some little cost.
GLOUCESTER:
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
GLOUCESTER:
And then return lamenting to my love.
GLOUCESTER:
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
GLOUCESTER:
That I may see my shadow as I pass.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE III. The palace.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY
RIVERS:
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
RIVERS:
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
GREY:
In that you brook it in, it makes him worse
GREY:
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
GREY:
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If he were dead, what would betide of me?
RIVERS:
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
GREY:
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
GREY:
To be your comforter when he is gone.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, he is young and his minority
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
RIVERS:
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is determined, not concluded yet
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY
GREY:
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto your royal grace!
DERBY:
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
DERBY:
I do beseech you, either not believe
DERBY:
The envious slanders of her false accusers,
DERBY:
Or, if she be accused in true report,
DERBY:
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
DERBY:
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
RIVERS:
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
DERBY:
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
DERBY:
Are come from visiting his majesty.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope, his grace speaks cheerfully.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
BUCKINGHAM:
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
BUCKINGHAM:
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain,
BUCKINGHAM:
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Would all were well! but that will never be
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I fear our happiness is at the highest.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET
GLOUCESTER:
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it
GLOUCESTER:
Who are they that complain unto the king,
GLOUCESTER:
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
GLOUCESTER:
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
GLOUCESTER:
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
GLOUCESTER:
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
GLOUCESTER:
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
GLOUCESTER:
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
GLOUCESTER:
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
GLOUCESTER:
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
GLOUCESTER:
But thus his simple truth must be abused
GLOUCESTER:
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
RIVERS:
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
GLOUCESTER:
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
GLOUCESTER:
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
GLOUCESTER:
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
GLOUCESTER:
A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
GLOUCESTER:
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
GLOUCESTER:
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
GLOUCESTER:
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king, of his own royal disposition,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And not provoked by any suitor else,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which in your outward actions shows itself
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Makes him to send, that thereby he may gather
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
GLOUCESTER:
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
GLOUCESTER:
Since every Jack became a gentleman
GLOUCESTER:
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Gloucester,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You envy my advancement and my friends'
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant we never may have need of you!
GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you
GLOUCESTER:
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
GLOUCESTER:
Myself disgraced, and the nobility
GLOUCESTER:
Held in contempt, whilst many fair promotions
GLOUCESTER:
Are daily given to ennoble those
GLOUCESTER:
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Him that raised me to this careful height
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did incense his majesty
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
GLOUCESTER:
You may deny that you were not the cause
GLOUCESTER:
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
RIVERS:
She may, my lord, for--
GLOUCESTER:
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
GLOUCESTER:
She may do more, sir, than denying that
GLOUCESTER:
She may help you to many fair preferments,
GLOUCESTER:
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
GLOUCESTER:
And lay those honours on your high deserts.
GLOUCESTER:
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
RIVERS:
What, marry, may she?
GLOUCESTER:
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
GLOUCESTER:
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too
GLOUCESTER:
I wis your grandam had a worser match.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I had rather be a country servant-maid
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Than a great queen, with this condition,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Small joy have I in being England's queen.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
GLOUCESTER:
What! threat you me with telling of the king?
GLOUCESTER:
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
GLOUCESTER:
I will avouch in presence of the king
GLOUCESTER:
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis time to speak, my pains are quite forgot.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Out, devil! I remember them too well
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
GLOUCESTER:
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
GLOUCESTER:
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,
GLOUCESTER:
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
GLOUCESTER:
A liberal rewarder of his friends
GLOUCESTER:
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
GLOUCESTER:
In all which time you and your husband Grey
GLOUCESTER:
Were factious for the house of Lancaster,
GLOUCESTER:
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
GLOUCESTER:
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
GLOUCESTER:
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
GLOUCESTER:
What you have been ere now, and what you are,
GLOUCESTER:
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
QUEEN MARGARET:
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,
GLOUCESTER:
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
QUEEN MARGARET:
Which God revenge!
GLOUCESTER:
To fight on Edward's party for the crown,
GLOUCESTER:
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
GLOUCESTER:
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's,
GLOUCESTER:
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
GLOUCESTER:
I am too childish-foolish for this world.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
RIVERS:
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
RIVERS:
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
RIVERS:
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king
RIVERS:
So should we you, if you should be our king.
GLOUCESTER:
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar
GLOUCESTER:
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy may you suppose in me.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
QUEEN MARGARET:
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
QUEEN MARGARET:
I can no longer hold me patient.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Advancing
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
QUEEN MARGARET:
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
QUEEN MARGARET:
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
QUEEN MARGARET:
O gentle villain, do not turn away!
GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That will I make before I let thee go.
GLOUCESTER:
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
QUEEN MARGARET:
I was, but I do find more pain in banishment
QUEEN MARGARET:
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
QUEEN MARGARET:
A husband and a son thou owest to me,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And thou a kingdom, all of you allegiance
QUEEN MARGARET:
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
GLOUCESTER:
The curse my noble father laid on thee,
GLOUCESTER:
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
GLOUCESTER:
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
GLOUCESTER:
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
GLOUCESTER:
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
GLOUCESTER:
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
GLOUCESTER:
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee,
GLOUCESTER:
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So just is God, to right the innocent.
HASTINGS:
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
HASTINGS:
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
RIVERS:
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
DORSET:
No man but prophesied revenge for it.
BUCKINGHAM:
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What were you snarling all before I came,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
QUEEN MARGARET:
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
QUEEN MARGARET:
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
QUEEN MARGARET:
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And see another, as I see thee now,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Long die thy happy days before thy death,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
QUEEN MARGARET:
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That none of you may live your natural age,
QUEEN MARGARET:
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
GLOUCESTER:
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
QUEEN MARGARET:
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
QUEEN MARGARET:
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
QUEEN MARGARET:
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And then hurl down their indignation
QUEEN MARGARET:
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
QUEEN MARGARET:
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
QUEEN MARGARET:
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
QUEEN MARGARET:
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
QUEEN MARGARET:
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
GLOUCESTER:
Margaret.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!
GLOUCESTER:
Ha!
QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not.
GLOUCESTER:
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
GLOUCESTER:
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, let me make the period to my curse!
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
QUEEN MARGARET:
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
QUEEN MARGARET:
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
HASTINGS:
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
HASTINGS:
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
RIVERS:
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
QUEEN MARGARET:
To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
DORSET:
Dispute not with her, she is lunatic.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, master marquess, you are malapert
QUEEN MARGARET:
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, that your young nobility could judge
QUEEN MARGARET:
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
QUEEN MARGARET:
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
GLOUCESTER:
Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
DORSET:
It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
GLOUCESTER:
Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
GLOUCESTER:
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
GLOUCESTER:
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And turns the sun to shade, alas! alas!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
QUEEN MARGARET:
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Urge neither charity nor shame to me
QUEEN MARGARET:
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
QUEEN MARGARET:
My charity is outrage, life my shame
QUEEN MARGARET:
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
BUCKINGHAM:
Have done, have done.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
QUEEN MARGARET:
In sign of league and amity with thee
QUEEN MARGARET:
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one here, for curses never pass
BUCKINGHAM:
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
QUEEN MARGARET:
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Look, when he fawns, he bites, and when he bites,
QUEEN MARGARET:
His venom tooth will rankle to the death
QUEEN MARGARET:
Have not to do with him, beware of him,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And all their ministers attend on him.
GLOUCESTER:
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
QUEEN MARGARET:
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but remember this another day,
QUEEN MARGARET:
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Exit
HASTINGS:
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
RIVERS:
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
GLOUCESTER:
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
GLOUCESTER:
She hath had too much wrong, and I repent
GLOUCESTER:
My part thereof that I have done to her.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did her any, to my knowledge.
GLOUCESTER:
But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
GLOUCESTER:
I was too hot to do somebody good,
GLOUCESTER:
That is too cold in thinking of it now.
GLOUCESTER:
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
GLOUCESTER:
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
GLOUCESTER:
God pardon them that are the cause of it!
RIVERS:
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
RIVERS:
To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
GLOUCESTER:
So do I ever
GLOUCESTER:
Aside
GLOUCESTER:
being well-advised.
GLOUCESTER:
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter CATESBY
CATESBY:
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
CATESBY:
And for your grace, and you, my noble lords.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
RIVERS:
Madam, we will attend your grace.
RIVERS:
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
GLOUCESTER:
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
GLOUCESTER:
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
GLOUCESTER:
I do beweep to many simple gulls
GLOUCESTER:
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham,
GLOUCESTER:
And say it is the queen and her allies
GLOUCESTER:
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
GLOUCESTER:
Now, they believe it, and withal whet me
GLOUCESTER:
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey
GLOUCESTER:
But then I sigh, and, with a piece of scripture,
GLOUCESTER:
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil
GLOUCESTER:
And thus I clothe my naked villany
GLOUCESTER:
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ,
GLOUCESTER:
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter two Murderers
GLOUCESTER:
But, soft! here come my executioners.
GLOUCESTER:
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
GLOUCESTER:
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
First Murderer:
We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant
First Murderer:
That we may be admitted where he is.
GLOUCESTER:
Well thought upon, I have it here about me.
GLOUCESTER:
Gives the warrant
GLOUCESTER:
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
GLOUCESTER:
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
GLOUCESTER:
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead,
GLOUCESTER:
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
GLOUCESTER:
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
First Murderer:
Tush!
First Murderer:
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate,
First Murderer:
Talkers are no good doers: be assured
First Murderer:
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
GLOUCESTER:
Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears
GLOUCESTER:
I like you, lads, about your business straight,
GLOUCESTER:
Go, go, dispatch.
First Murderer:
We will, my noble lord.
First Murderer:
Exeunt
First Murderer:
SCENE IV. London. The Tower.
First Murderer:
Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY
BRAKENBURY:
Why looks your grace so heavily today?
CLARENCE:
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
CLARENCE:
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
CLARENCE:
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
CLARENCE:
I would not spend another such a night,
CLARENCE:
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
CLARENCE:
So full of dismal terror was the time!
BRAKENBURY:
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
CLARENCE:
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
CLARENCE:
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy,
CLARENCE:
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester,
CLARENCE:
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
CLARENCE:
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
CLARENCE:
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
CLARENCE:
During the wars of York and Lancaster
CLARENCE:
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
CLARENCE:
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
CLARENCE:
Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and, in falling,
CLARENCE:
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
CLARENCE:
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
CLARENCE:
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
CLARENCE:
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
CLARENCE:
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
CLARENCE:
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
CLARENCE:
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
CLARENCE:
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
CLARENCE:
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
CLARENCE:
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea
CLARENCE:
Some lay in dead men's skulls, and, in those holes
CLARENCE:
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
CLARENCE:
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
CLARENCE:
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
CLARENCE:
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
BRAKENBURY:
Had you such leisure in the time of death
BRAKENBURY:
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
CLARENCE:
Methought I had, and often did I strive
CLARENCE:
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
CLARENCE:
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
CLARENCE:
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air,
CLARENCE:
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
CLARENCE:
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
BRAKENBURY:
Awaked you not with this sore agony?
CLARENCE:
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life,
CLARENCE:
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
CLARENCE:
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
CLARENCE:
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
CLARENCE:
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
CLARENCE:
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
CLARENCE:
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
CLARENCE:
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
CLARENCE:
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
CLARENCE:
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
CLARENCE:
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
CLARENCE:
Dabbled in blood, and he squeak'd out aloud,
CLARENCE:
'Clarence is come, false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
CLARENCE:
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury,
CLARENCE:
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
CLARENCE:
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
CLARENCE:
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
CLARENCE:
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
CLARENCE:
I trembling waked, and for a season after
CLARENCE:
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
CLARENCE:
Such terrible impression made the dream.
BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you,
BRAKENBURY:
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
CLARENCE:
O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
CLARENCE:
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
CLARENCE:
For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me!
CLARENCE:
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
CLARENCE:
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
CLARENCE:
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
CLARENCE:
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
CLARENCE:
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me,
CLARENCE:
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
BRAKENBURY:
CLARENCE sleeps
BRAKENBURY:
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
BRAKENBURY:
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
BRAKENBURY:
Princes have but their tides for their glories,
BRAKENBURY:
An outward honour for an inward toil,
BRAKENBURY:
And, for unfelt imagination,
BRAKENBURY:
They often feel a world of restless cares
BRAKENBURY:
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
BRAKENBURY:
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
BRAKENBURY:
Enter the two Murderers
First Murderer:
Ho! who's here?
BRAKENBURY:
In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
First Murderer:
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
BRAKENBURY:
Yea, are you so brief?
Second Murderer:
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
Second Murderer:
him our commission, talk no more.
Second Murderer:
BRAKENBURY reads it
BRAKENBURY:
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
BRAKENBURY:
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands
BRAKENBURY:
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
BRAKENBURY:
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
BRAKENBURY:
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep
BRAKENBURY:
I'll to the king, and signify to him
BRAKENBURY:
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
First Murderer:
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
First Murderer:
Exit BRAKENBURY
Second Murderer:
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
First Murderer:
No, then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
Second Murderer:
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
Second Murderer:
the judgment-day.
First Murderer:
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
Second Murderer:
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
Second Murderer:
of remorse in me.
First Murderer:
What, art thou afraid?
Second Murderer:
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it, but to be
Second Murderer:
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
First Murderer:
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
Second Murderer:
So I am, to let him live.
First Murderer:
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
Second Murderer:
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
Second Murderer:
will change, 'twas wont to hold me but while one
Second Murderer:
would tell twenty.
First Murderer:
How dost thou feel thyself now?
Second Murderer:
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
Second Murderer:
within me.
First Murderer:
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
Second Murderer:
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
First Murderer:
Where is thy conscience now?
Second Murderer:
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
First Murderer:
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
First Murderer:
thy conscience flies out.
Second Murderer:
Let it go, there's few or none will entertain it.
First Murderer:
How if it come to thee again?
Second Murderer:
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
Second Murderer:
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
Second Murderer:
accuseth him, he cannot swear, but it cheques him,
Second Murderer:
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
Second Murderer:
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
Second Murderer:
mutinies in a man's bosom, it fills one full of
Second Murderer:
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
Second Murderer:
that I found, it beggars any man that keeps it: it
Second Murderer:
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
Second Murderer:
dangerous thing, and every man that means to live
Second Murderer:
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
Second Murderer:
without it.
First Murderer:
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
First Murderer:
not to kill the duke.
Second Murderer:
Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
Second Murderer:
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
First Murderer:
Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
First Murderer:
I warrant thee.
Second Murderer:
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
Second Murderer:
reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
First Murderer:
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
First Murderer:
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
First Murderer:
in the next room.
Second Murderer:
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
First Murderer:
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with him.
CLARENCE:
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
Second murderer:
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
CLARENCE:
In God's name, what art thou?
Second Murderer:
A man, as you are.
CLARENCE:
But not, as I am, royal.
Second Murderer:
Nor you, as we are, loyal.
CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
Second Murderer:
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
CLARENCE:
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
CLARENCE:
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
CLARENCE:
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
Both:
To, to, to--
CLARENCE:
To murder me?
Both:
Ay, ay.
CLARENCE:
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
CLARENCE:
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
CLARENCE:
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
First Murderer:
Offended us you have not, but the king.
CLARENCE:
I shall be reconciled to him again.
Second Murderer:
Never, my lord, therefore prepare to die.
CLARENCE:
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
CLARENCE:
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
CLARENCE:
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
CLARENCE:
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
CLARENCE:
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
CLARENCE:
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
CLARENCE:
Before I be convict by course of law,
CLARENCE:
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
CLARENCE:
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
CLARENCE:
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
CLARENCE:
That you depart and lay no hands on me
CLARENCE:
The deed you undertake is damnable.
First Murderer:
What we will do, we do upon command.
Second Murderer:
And he that hath commanded is the king.
CLARENCE:
Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
CLARENCE:
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
CLARENCE:
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
CLARENCE:
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
CLARENCE:
Take heed, for he holds vengeance in his hands,
CLARENCE:
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
Second Murderer:
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
Second Murderer:
For false forswearing and for murder too
Second Murderer:
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
Second Murderer:
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
First Murderer:
And, like a traitor to the name of God,
First Murderer:
Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous blade
First Murderer:
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
Second Murderer:
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
First Murderer:
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
First Murderer:
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
CLARENCE:
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
CLARENCE:
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
CLARENCE:
He sends ye not to murder me for this
CLARENCE:
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
CLARENCE:
If God will be revenged for this deed.
CLARENCE:
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
CLARENCE:
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm,
CLARENCE:
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
CLARENCE:
To cut off those that have offended him.
First Murderer:
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
First Murderer:
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
First Murderer:
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
CLARENCE:
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
First Murderer:
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
First Murderer:
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
CLARENCE:
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me,
CLARENCE:
I am his brother, and I love him well.
CLARENCE:
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
CLARENCE:
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
CLARENCE:
Who shall reward you better for my life
CLARENCE:
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
Second Murderer:
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
CLARENCE:
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear
CLARENCE:
Go you to him from me.
Both:
Ay, so we will.
CLARENCE:
Tell him, when that our princely father York
CLARENCE:
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
CLARENCE:
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
CLARENCE:
He little thought of this divided friendship
CLARENCE:
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
First Murderer:
Ay, millstones, as be lesson'd us to weep.
CLARENCE:
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
First Murderer:
Right,
First Murderer:
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself
First Murderer:
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
CLARENCE:
It cannot be, for when I parted with him,
CLARENCE:
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
CLARENCE:
That he would labour my delivery.
Second Murderer:
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
Second Murderer:
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
First Murderer:
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
CLARENCE:
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
CLARENCE:
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
CLARENCE:
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
CLARENCE:
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
CLARENCE:
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
CLARENCE:
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
Second Murderer:
What shall we do?
CLARENCE:
Relent, and save your souls.
First Murderer:
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
CLARENCE:
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
CLARENCE:
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
CLARENCE:
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
CLARENCE:
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
CLARENCE:
Would not entreat for life?
CLARENCE:
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks
CLARENCE:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
CLARENCE:
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
CLARENCE:
As you would beg, were you in my distress
CLARENCE:
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
Second Murderer:
Look behind you, my lord.
First Murderer:
Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
First Murderer:
Stabs him
First Murderer:
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
First Murderer:
Exit, with the body
Second Murderer:
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
Second Murderer:
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
Second Murderer:
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
Second Murderer:
Re-enter First Murderer
First Murderer:
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
First Murderer:
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
Second Murderer:
I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
Second Murderer:
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say,
Second Murderer:
For I repent me that the duke is slain.
Second Murderer:
Exit
First Murderer:
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
First Murderer:
Now must I hide his body in some hole,
First Murderer:
Until the duke take order for his burial
First Murderer:
And when I have my meed, I must away,
First Murderer:
For this will out, and here I must not stay.
First Murderer:
ACT II
First Murderer:
SCENE I. London. The palace.
First Murderer:
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick, QUEEN  ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others
KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work
KING EDWARD IV:
You peers, continue this united league
KING EDWARD IV:
I every day expect an embassage
KING EDWARD IV:
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence,
KING EDWARD IV:
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
KING EDWARD IV:
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
KING EDWARD IV:
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand,
KING EDWARD IV:
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
RIVERS:
By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate
RIVERS:
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
HASTINGS:
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
KING EDWARD IV:
Take heed you dally not before your king,
KING EDWARD IV:
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
KING EDWARD IV:
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
KING EDWARD IV:
Either of you to be the other's end.
HASTINGS:
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
RIVERS:
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
KING EDWARD IV:
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you,
KING EDWARD IV:
You have been factious one against the other,
KING EDWARD IV:
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand,
KING EDWARD IV:
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings, I will never more remember
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
KING EDWARD IV:
Dorset, embrace him, Hastings, love lord marquess.
DORSET:
This interchange of love, I here protest,
DORSET:
Upon my part shall be unviolable.
HASTINGS:
And so swear I, my lord
HASTINGS:
They embrace
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
KING EDWARD IV:
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
KING EDWARD IV:
And make me happy in your unity.
BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
BUCKINGHAM:
On you or yours,
BUCKINGHAM:
To the Queen
BUCKINGHAM:
but with all duteous love
BUCKINGHAM:
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
BUCKINGHAM:
With hate in those where I expect most love!
BUCKINGHAM:
When I have most need to employ a friend,
BUCKINGHAM:
And most assured that he is a friend
BUCKINGHAM:
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
BUCKINGHAM:
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
BUCKINGHAM:
When I am cold in zeal to yours.
KING EDWARD IV:
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
KING EDWARD IV:
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
KING EDWARD IV:
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
KING EDWARD IV:
To make the perfect period of this peace.
BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
BUCKINGHAM:
Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen
GLOUCESTER:
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
KING EDWARD IV:
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
KING EDWARD IV:
Brother, we done deeds of charity,
KING EDWARD IV:
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
KING EDWARD IV:
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege
GLOUCESTER:
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
GLOUCESTER:
By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
GLOUCESTER:
Hold me a foe,
GLOUCESTER:
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
GLOUCESTER:
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
GLOUCESTER:
By any in this presence, I desire
GLOUCESTER:
To reconcile me to his friendly peace
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity,
GLOUCESTER:
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
GLOUCESTER:
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
GLOUCESTER:
Which I will purchase with my duteous service,
GLOUCESTER:
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
GLOUCESTER:
If ever any grudge were lodged between us,
GLOUCESTER:
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you,
GLOUCESTER:
That without desert have frown'd on me,
GLOUCESTER:
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen, indeed, of all.
GLOUCESTER:
I do not know that Englishman alive
GLOUCESTER:
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
GLOUCESTER:
More than the infant that is born to-night
GLOUCESTER:
I thank my God for my humility.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
GLOUCESTER:
To be so bouted in this royal presence?
GLOUCESTER:
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
GLOUCESTER:
They all start
GLOUCESTER:
You do him injury to scorn his corse.
RIVERS:
Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
DORSET:
Ay, my good lord, and no one in this presence
DORSET:
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
KING EDWARD IV:
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
GLOUCESTER:
And that a winged Mercury did bear
GLOUCESTER:
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
GLOUCESTER:
That came too lag to see him buried.
GLOUCESTER:
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
GLOUCESTER:
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
GLOUCESTER:
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
GLOUCESTER:
And yet go current from suspicion!
GLOUCESTER:
Enter DERBY
DORSET:
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
KING EDWARD IV:
I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
DORSET:
I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
KING EDWARD IV:
Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
DORSET:
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life,
DORSET:
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
DORSET:
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
KING EDWARD IV:
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
KING EDWARD IV:
My brother slew no man, his fault was thought,
KING EDWARD IV:
And yet his punishment was cruel death.
KING EDWARD IV:
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
KING EDWARD IV:
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
KING EDWARD IV:
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
KING EDWARD IV:
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
KING EDWARD IV:
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
KING EDWARD IV:
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
KING EDWARD IV:
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
KING EDWARD IV:
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
KING EDWARD IV:
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
KING EDWARD IV:
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
KING EDWARD IV:
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
KING EDWARD IV:
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
KING EDWARD IV:
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
KING EDWARD IV:
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
KING EDWARD IV:
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
KING EDWARD IV:
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
KING EDWARD IV:
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
KING EDWARD IV:
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
KING EDWARD IV:
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon,
KING EDWARD IV:
And I unjustly too, must grant it you
KING EDWARD IV:
But for my brother not a man would speak,
KING EDWARD IV:
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
KING EDWARD IV:
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
KING EDWARD IV:
Have been beholding to him in his life,
KING EDWARD IV:
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
KING EDWARD IV:
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
KING EDWARD IV:
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
KING EDWARD IV:
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
KING EDWARD IV:
Oh, poor Clarence!
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET
GLOUCESTER:
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
GLOUCESTER:
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
GLOUCESTER:
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
GLOUCESTER:
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
GLOUCESTER:
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
GLOUCESTER:
To comfort Edward with our company.
BUCKINGHAM:
We wait upon your grace.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exeunt
BUCKINGHAM:
SCENE II. The palace.
BUCKINGHAM:
Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK, with the two children of CLARENCE
Boy:
Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, boy.
Boy:
Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
Boy:
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
Girl:
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
Girl:
And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
Girl:
If that our noble father be alive?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
My pretty cousins, you mistake me much,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do lament the sickness of the king.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
As loath to lose him, not your father's death,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
Boy:
Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
Boy:
The king my uncle is to blame for this
Boy:
God will revenge it, whom I will importune
Boy:
With daily prayers all to that effect.
Girl:
And so will I.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Incapable and shallow innocents,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
Boy:
Grandam, we can, for my good uncle Gloucester
Boy:
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
Boy:
Devised impeachments to imprison him
Boy:
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
Boy:
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek,
Boy:
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
Boy:
And he would love me dearly as his child.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
He is my son, yea, and therein my shame,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
Boy:
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ay, boy.
Boy:
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
Boy:
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her ears, RIVERS, and DORSET after her
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I'll join with black despair against my soul,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And to myself become an enemy.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
What means this scene of rude impatience?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To make an act of tragic violence
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If you will live, lament, if die, be brief,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
DUCHESS OF YORK:
As I had title in thy noble husband!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And lived by looking on his images
DUCHESS OF YORK:
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee
DUCHESS OF YORK:
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
Boy:
Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death,
Boy:
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
Girl:
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd,
Girl:
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Give me no help in lamentation,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
Children:
Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
Children:
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Was never widow had so dear a loss!
Children:
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Was never mother had so dear a loss!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she
DUCHESS OF YORK:
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I for an Edward weep, so do not they
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And I will pamper it with lamentations.
DORSET:
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
DORSET:
That you take with unthankfulness, his doing
DORSET:
In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
DORSET:
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
DORSET:
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent,
DORSET:
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
DORSET:
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
RIVERS:
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
RIVERS:
Let him be crown'd, in him your comfort lives
RIVERS:
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
RIVERS:
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
RIVERS:
Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF
GLOUCESTER:
Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
GLOUCESTER:
To wail the dimming of our shining star,
GLOUCESTER:
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
GLOUCESTER:
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy,
GLOUCESTER:
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
GLOUCESTER:
I crave your blessing.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
God bless thee, and put meekness in thy mind,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside]  Amen, and make me die a good old man!
GLOUCESTER:
That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing
GLOUCESTER:
I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
BUCKINGHAM:
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
BUCKINGHAM:
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
BUCKINGHAM:
Now cheer each other in each other's love
BUCKINGHAM:
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
BUCKINGHAM:
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
BUCKINGHAM:
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
BUCKINGHAM:
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
BUCKINGHAM:
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept
BUCKINGHAM:
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
BUCKINGHAM:
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
BUCKINGHAM:
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
RIVERS:
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
BUCKINGHAM:
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
BUCKINGHAM:
Which would be so much the more dangerous
BUCKINGHAM:
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd
BUCKINGHAM:
Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
BUCKINGHAM:
And may direct his course as please himself,
BUCKINGHAM:
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
BUCKINGHAM:
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
GLOUCESTER:
I hope the king made peace with all of us
GLOUCESTER:
And the compact is firm and true in me.
RIVERS:
And so in me, and so, I think, in all
RIVERS:
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
RIVERS:
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
RIVERS:
Which haply by much company might be urged
RIVERS:
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
RIVERS:
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
HASTINGS:
And so say I.
GLOUCESTER:
Then be it so, and go we to determine
GLOUCESTER:
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
GLOUCESTER:
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
GLOUCESTER:
To give your censures in this weighty business?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
With all our harts.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
BUCKINGHAM:
For God's sake, let not us two be behind,
BUCKINGHAM:
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
BUCKINGHAM:
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
BUCKINGHAM:
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
GLOUCESTER:
My other self, my counsel's consistory,
GLOUCESTER:
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
GLOUCESTER:
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
GLOUCESTER:
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE III. London. A street.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter two Citizens meeting
First Citizen:
Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
Second Citizen:
I promise you, I scarcely know myself
Second Citizen:
Hear you the news abroad?
First Citizen:
Ay, that the king is dead.
Second Citizen:
Bad news, by'r lady, seldom comes the better
Second Citizen:
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
Second Citizen:
Enter another Citizen
Third Citizen:
Neighbours, God speed!
First Citizen:
Give you good morrow, sir.
Third Citizen:
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
Second Citizen:
Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while!
Third Citizen:
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
First Citizen:
No, no, by God's good grace his son shall reign.
Third Citizen:
Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
Second Citizen:
In him there is a hope of government,
Second Citizen:
That in his nonage council under him,
Second Citizen:
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
Second Citizen:
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
First Citizen:
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
First Citizen:
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
Third Citizen:
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot,
Third Citizen:
For then this land was famously enrich'd
Third Citizen:
With politic grave counsel, then the king
Third Citizen:
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
First Citizen:
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
Third Citizen:
Better it were they all came by the father,
Third Citizen:
Or by the father there were none at all,
Third Citizen:
For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
Third Citizen:
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
Third Citizen:
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
Third Citizen:
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud
Third Citizen:
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
Third Citizen:
This sickly land might solace as before.
First Citizen:
Come, come, we fear the worst, all shall be well.
Third Citizen:
When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks,
Third Citizen:
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand,
Third Citizen:
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
Third Citizen:
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
Third Citizen:
All may be well, but, if God sort it so,
Third Citizen:
'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
Second Citizen:
Truly, the souls of men are full of dread
Second Citizen:
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
Second Citizen:
That looks not heavily and full of fear.
Third Citizen:
Before the times of change, still is it so
Third Citizen:
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
Third Citizen:
Ensuing dangers, as by proof, we see
Third Citizen:
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
Third Citizen:
But leave it all to God. whither away?
Second Citizen:
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
Third Citizen:
And so was I: I'll bear you company.
Third Citizen:
Exeunt
Third Citizen:
SCENE IV. London. The palace.
Third Citizen:
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart to see the prince
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But I hear, no, they say my son of York
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
YORK:
Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
YORK:
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
YORK:
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
YORK:
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
YORK:
Gloucester,
YORK:
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
YORK:
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
YORK:
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
DUCHESS OF YORK:
In him that did object the same to thee,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.
YORK:
Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
YORK:
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
YORK:
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
YORK:
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
YORK:
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
YORK:
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
YORK:
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
YORK:
Grandam, his nurse.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
YORK:
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Good madam, be not angry with the child.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Pitchers have ears.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Enter a Messenger
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Here comes a messenger. What news?
Messenger:
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares the prince?
Messenger:
Well, madam, and in health.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is thy news then?
Messenger:
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
Messenger:
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who hath committed them?
Messenger:
The mighty dukes
Messenger:
Gloucester and Buckingham.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For what offence?
Messenger:
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed,
Messenger:
Why or for what these nobles were committed
Messenger:
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Upon the innocent and aweless throne
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I see, as in a map, the end of all.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
My husband lost his life to get the crown,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And being seated, and domestic broils
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Make war upon themselves, blood against blood,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Self against self: O, preposterous
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Or let me die, to look on death no more!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, my boy, we will to sanctuary.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Madam, farewell.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with you.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You have no cause.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
My gracious lady, go,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
As well I tender you and all of yours!
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Exeunt
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
ACT III
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
SCENE I. London. A street.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others
BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
GLOUCESTER:
The weary way hath made you melancholy.
PRINCE EDWARD:
No, uncle, but our crosses on the way
PRINCE EDWARD:
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
PRINCE EDWARD:
I want more uncles here to welcome me.
GLOUCESTER:
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
GLOUCESTER:
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
GLOUCESTER:
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
GLOUCESTER:
Than of his outward show, which, God he knows,
GLOUCESTER:
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
GLOUCESTER:
Those uncles which you want were dangerous,
GLOUCESTER:
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
GLOUCESTER:
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts
GLOUCESTER:
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
PRINCE EDWARD:
God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
GLOUCESTER:
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter the Lord Mayor and his train
Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace with health and happy days!
PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.
PRINCE EDWARD:
I thought my mother, and my brother York,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Would long ere this have met us on the way
PRINCE EDWARD:
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
PRINCE EDWARD:
To tell us whether they will come or no!
PRINCE EDWARD:
Enter HASTINGS
BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
HASTINGS:
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
HASTINGS:
The queen your mother, and your brother York,
HASTINGS:
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
HASTINGS:
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
HASTINGS:
But by his mother was perforce withheld.
BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
BUCKINGHAM:
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
BUCKINGHAM:
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
BUCKINGHAM:
Unto his princely brother presently?
BUCKINGHAM:
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
BUCKINGHAM:
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
CARDINAL:
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
CARDINAL:
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
CARDINAL:
Anon expect him here, but if she be obdurate
CARDINAL:
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
CARDINAL:
We should infringe the holy privilege
CARDINAL:
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
CARDINAL:
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
BUCKINGHAM:
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
BUCKINGHAM:
Too ceremonious and traditional
BUCKINGHAM:
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
BUCKINGHAM:
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
BUCKINGHAM:
The benefit thereof is always granted
BUCKINGHAM:
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
BUCKINGHAM:
And those who have the wit to claim the place
BUCKINGHAM:
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it,
BUCKINGHAM:
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it
BUCKINGHAM:
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
BUCKINGHAM:
You break no privilege nor charter there.
BUCKINGHAM:
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,
BUCKINGHAM:
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
CARDINAL:
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
CARDINAL:
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
HASTINGS:
I go, my lord.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
PRINCE EDWARD:
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
GLOUCESTER:
If I may counsel you, some day or two
GLOUCESTER:
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower
GLOUCESTER:
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
GLOUCESTER:
For your best health and recreation.
PRINCE EDWARD:
I do not like the Tower, of any place.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
BUCKINGHAM:
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Is it upon record, or else reported
PRINCE EDWARD:
Successively from age to age, he built it?
BUCKINGHAM:
Upon record, my gracious lord.
PRINCE EDWARD:
But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
PRINCE EDWARD:
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Even to the general all-ending day.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
GLOUCESTER:
live long.
PRINCE EDWARD:
What say you, uncle?
GLOUCESTER:
I say, without characters, fame lives long.
GLOUCESTER:
Aside
GLOUCESTER:
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
GLOUCESTER:
I moralize two meanings in one word.
PRINCE EDWARD:
That Julius Caesar was a famous man,
PRINCE EDWARD:
With what his valour did enrich his wit,
PRINCE EDWARD:
His wit set down to make his valour live
PRINCE EDWARD:
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,
PRINCE EDWARD:
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
PRINCE EDWARD:
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
BUCKINGHAM:
What, my gracious lord?
PRINCE EDWARD:
An if I live until I be a man,
PRINCE EDWARD:
I'll win our ancient right in France again,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL
BUCKINGHAM:
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
YORK:
Well, my dread lord, so must I call you now.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours
PRINCE EDWARD:
Too late he died that might have kept that title,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
GLOUCESTER:
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
YORK:
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
YORK:
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
YORK:
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
GLOUCESTER:
He hath, my lord.
YORK:
And therefore is he idle?
GLOUCESTER:
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
YORK:
Then is he more beholding to you than I.
GLOUCESTER:
He may command me as my sovereign,
GLOUCESTER:
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
YORK:
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
GLOUCESTER:
My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
PRINCE EDWARD:
A beggar, brother?
YORK:
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
YORK:
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
GLOUCESTER:
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
YORK:
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
GLOUCESTER:
A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
YORK:
O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts,
YORK:
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
GLOUCESTER:
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
GLOUCESTER:
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
YORK:
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
GLOUCESTER:
How?
YORK:
Little.
PRINCE EDWARD:
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk
PRINCE EDWARD:
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
YORK:
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me
YORK:
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me,
YORK:
Because that I am little, like an ape,
YORK:
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
BUCKINGHAM:
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
BUCKINGHAM:
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
BUCKINGHAM:
He prettily and aptly taunts himself
BUCKINGHAM:
So cunning and so young is wonderful.
GLOUCESTER:
My lord, will't please you pass along?
GLOUCESTER:
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
GLOUCESTER:
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
GLOUCESTER:
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
YORK:
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
PRINCE EDWARD:
My lord protector needs will have it so.
YORK:
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, what should you fear?
YORK:
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost
YORK:
My grandam told me he was murdered there.
PRINCE EDWARD:
I fear no uncles dead.
GLOUCESTER:
Nor none that live, I hope.
PRINCE EDWARD:
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
PRINCE EDWARD:
But come, my lord, and with a heavy heart,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
PRINCE EDWARD:
A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM:
Think you, my lord, this little prating York
BUCKINGHAM:
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
BUCKINGHAM:
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt, O, 'tis a parlous boy,
GLOUCESTER:
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
GLOUCESTER:
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
BUCKINGHAM:
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
BUCKINGHAM:
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
BUCKINGHAM:
As closely to conceal what we impart
BUCKINGHAM:
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way,
BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
BUCKINGHAM:
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
BUCKINGHAM:
For the instalment of this noble duke
BUCKINGHAM:
In the seat royal of this famous isle?
CATESBY:
He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
CATESBY:
That he will not be won to aught against him.
BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
CATESBY:
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
BUCKINGHAM:
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
BUCKINGHAM:
How doth he stand affected to our purpose,
BUCKINGHAM:
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
BUCKINGHAM:
To sit about the coronation.
BUCKINGHAM:
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
BUCKINGHAM:
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons
BUCKINGHAM:
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
BUCKINGHAM:
Be thou so too, and so break off your talk,
BUCKINGHAM:
And give us notice of his inclination
BUCKINGHAM:
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
BUCKINGHAM:
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
GLOUCESTER:
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
GLOUCESTER:
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle,
GLOUCESTER:
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
GLOUCESTER:
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
BUCKINGHAM:
Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
CATESBY:
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
GLOUCESTER:
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
CATESBY:
You shall, my lord.
GLOUCESTER:
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM:
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
BUCKINGHAM:
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
GLOUCESTER:
Chop off his head, man, somewhat we will do
GLOUCESTER:
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
GLOUCESTER:
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
GLOUCESTER:
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
BUCKINGHAM:
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
GLOUCESTER:
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
GLOUCESTER:
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
GLOUCESTER:
We may digest our complots in some form.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE II. Before Lord Hastings' house.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
What, ho! my lord!
HASTINGS:
[Within]  Who knocks at the door?
Messenger:
A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
Messenger:
Enter HASTINGS
HASTINGS:
What is't o'clock?
Messenger:
Upon the stroke of four.
HASTINGS:
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
Messenger:
So it should seem by that I have to say.
Messenger:
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
HASTINGS:
And then?
Messenger:
And then he sends you word
Messenger:
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm
Messenger:
Besides, he says there are two councils held,
Messenger:
And that may be determined at the one
Messenger:
which may make you and him to rue at the other.
Messenger:
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
Messenger:
If presently you will take horse with him,
Messenger:
And with all speed post with him toward the north,
Messenger:
To shun the danger that his soul divines.
HASTINGS:
Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord,
HASTINGS:
Bid him not fear the separated councils
HASTINGS:
His honour and myself are at the one,
HASTINGS:
And at the other is my servant Catesby
HASTINGS:
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
HASTINGS:
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
HASTINGS:
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance
HASTINGS:
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
HASTINGS:
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
HASTINGS:
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
HASTINGS:
Were to incense the boar to follow us
HASTINGS:
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
HASTINGS:
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
HASTINGS:
And we will both together to the Tower,
HASTINGS:
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
Messenger:
My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
Messenger:
Exit
Messenger:
Enter CATESBY
CATESBY:
Many good morrows to my noble lord!
HASTINGS:
Good morrow, Catesby, you are early stirring
HASTINGS:
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord,
CATESBY:
And I believe twill never stand upright
CATESBY:
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
HASTINGS:
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
CATESBY:
Ay, my good lord.
HASTINGS:
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
HASTINGS:
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
HASTINGS:
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
CATESBY:
Ay, on my life, and hopes to find forward
CATESBY:
Upon his party for the gain thereof
CATESBY:
And thereupon he sends you this good news,
CATESBY:
That this same very day your enemies,
CATESBY:
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
HASTINGS:
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
HASTINGS:
Because they have been still mine enemies
HASTINGS:
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
HASTINGS:
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
HASTINGS:
God knows I will not do it, to the death.
CATESBY:
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
HASTINGS:
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
HASTINGS:
That they who brought me in my master's hate
HASTINGS:
I live to look upon their tragedy.
HASTINGS:
I tell thee, Catesby--
CATESBY:
What, my lord?
HASTINGS:
Ere a fortnight make me elder,
HASTINGS:
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
CATESBY:
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
CATESBY:
When men are unprepared and look not for it.
HASTINGS:
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
HASTINGS:
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
HASTINGS:
With some men else, who think themselves as safe
HASTINGS:
As thou and I, who, as thou know'st, are dear
HASTINGS:
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
CATESBY:
The princes both make high account of you,
CATESBY:
Aside
CATESBY:
For they account his head upon the bridge.
HASTINGS:
I know they do, and I have well deserved it.
HASTINGS:
Enter STANLEY
HASTINGS:
Come on, come on, where is your boar-spear, man?
HASTINGS:
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
STANLEY:
My lord, good morrow, good morrow, Catesby
STANLEY:
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
STANLEY:
I do not like these several councils, I.
HASTINGS:
My lord,
HASTINGS:
I hold my life as dear as you do yours,
HASTINGS:
And never in my life, I do protest,
HASTINGS:
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now
HASTINGS:
Think you, but that I know our state secure,
HASTINGS:
I would be so triumphant as I am?
STANLEY:
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
STANLEY:
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
STANLEY:
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust,
STANLEY:
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
STANLEY:
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt
STANLEY:
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
STANLEY:
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
HASTINGS:
Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
HASTINGS:
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
LORD STANLEY:
They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
LORD STANLEY:
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
LORD STANLEY:
But come, my lord, let us away.
LORD STANLEY:
Enter a Pursuivant
HASTINGS:
Go on before, I'll talk with this good fellow.
HASTINGS:
Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
HASTINGS:
How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
Pursuivant:
The better that your lordship please to ask.
HASTINGS:
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
HASTINGS:
Than when I met thee last where now we meet
HASTINGS:
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
HASTINGS:
By the suggestion of the queen's allies,
HASTINGS:
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
HASTINGS:
This day those enemies are put to death,
HASTINGS:
And I in better state than e'er I was.
Pursuivant:
God hold it, to your honour's good content!
HASTINGS:
Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
HASTINGS:
Throws him his purse
Pursuivant:
God save your lordship!
Pursuivant:
Exit
Pursuivant:
Enter a Priest
Priest:
Well met, my lord, I am glad to see your honour.
HASTINGS:
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
HASTINGS:
I am in your debt for your last exercise,
HASTINGS:
Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
HASTINGS:
He whispers in his ear
HASTINGS:
Enter BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM:
What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
BUCKINGHAM:
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest,
BUCKINGHAM:
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
HASTINGS:
Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
HASTINGS:
Those men you talk of came into my mind.
HASTINGS:
What, go you toward the Tower?
BUCKINGHAM:
I do, my lord, but long I shall not stay
BUCKINGHAM:
I shall return before your lordship thence.
HASTINGS:
'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
BUCKINGHAM:
[Aside]  And supper too, although thou know'st it not.
BUCKINGHAM:
Come, will you go?
HASTINGS:
I'll wait upon your lordship.
HASTINGS:
Exeunt
HASTINGS:
SCENE III. Pomfret Castle.
HASTINGS:
Enter RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN to death
RATCLIFF:
Come, bring forth the prisoners.
RIVERS:
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this
RIVERS:
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
RIVERS:
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
GREY:
God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
GREY:
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
VAUGHAN:
You live that shall cry woe for this after.
RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, the limit of your lives is out.
RIVERS:
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
RIVERS:
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
RIVERS:
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
RIVERS:
Richard the second here was hack'd to death,
RIVERS:
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
RIVERS:
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
GREY:
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
GREY:
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
RIVERS:
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
RIVERS:
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
RIVERS:
To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
RIVERS:
And for my sister and her princely sons,
RIVERS:
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
RIVERS:
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
RATCLIFF:
Make haste, the hour of death is expiate.
RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace
RIVERS:
And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
RIVERS:
Exeunt
RIVERS:
SCENE IV. The Tower of London.
RIVERS:
Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP OF  ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, with others, and take their seats at a table
HASTINGS:
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
HASTINGS:
Is, to determine of the coronation.
HASTINGS:
In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
BUCKINGHAM:
Are all things fitting for that royal time?
DERBY:
It is, and wants but nomination.
BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
BUCKINGHAM:
Who is most inward with the royal duke?
BISHOP OF ELY:
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
BUCKINGHAM:
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
BUCKINGHAM:
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
BUCKINGHAM:
Than I of yours,
BUCKINGHAM:
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
BUCKINGHAM:
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
HASTINGS:
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well,
HASTINGS:
But, for his purpose in the coronation.
HASTINGS:
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
HASTINGS:
His gracious pleasure any way therein
HASTINGS:
But you, my noble lords, may name the time,
HASTINGS:
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
HASTINGS:
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
HASTINGS:
Enter GLOUCESTER
BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
GLOUCESTER:
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
GLOUCESTER:
I have been long a sleeper, but, I hope,
GLOUCESTER:
My absence doth neglect no great designs,
GLOUCESTER:
Which by my presence might have been concluded.
BUCKINGHAM:
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
BUCKINGHAM:
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
BUCKINGHAM:
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder,
GLOUCESTER:
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
HASTINGS:
I thank your grace.
GLOUCESTER:
My lord of Ely!
BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord?
GLOUCESTER:
When I was last in Holborn,
GLOUCESTER:
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
GLOUCESTER:
I do beseech you send for some of them.
BISHOP OF ELY:
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
BISHOP OF ELY:
Exit
GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
GLOUCESTER:
Drawing him aside
GLOUCESTER:
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
GLOUCESTER:
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
GLOUCESTER:
As he will lose his head ere give consent
GLOUCESTER:
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
GLOUCESTER:
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exit GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM following
DERBY:
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
DERBY:
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden,
DERBY:
For I myself am not so well provided
DERBY:
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
DERBY:
Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY
BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
BISHOP OF ELY:
strawberries.
HASTINGS:
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day,
HASTINGS:
There's some conceit or other likes him well,
HASTINGS:
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
HASTINGS:
I think there's never a man in Christendom
HASTINGS:
That can less hide his love or hate than he,
HASTINGS:
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
DERBY:
What of his heart perceive you in his face
DERBY:
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
HASTINGS:
Marry, that with no man here he is offended,
HASTINGS:
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
DERBY:
I pray God he be not, I say.
DERBY:
Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
GLOUCESTER:
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
GLOUCESTER:
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
GLOUCESTER:
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
GLOUCESTER:
Upon my body with their hellish charms?
HASTINGS:
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
HASTINGS:
Makes me most forward in this noble presence
HASTINGS:
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
HASTINGS:
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
GLOUCESTER:
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill
GLOUCESTER:
See how I am bewitch'd, behold mine arm
GLOUCESTER:
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up
GLOUCESTER:
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
GLOUCESTER:
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
GLOUCESTER:
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
HASTINGS:
If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
GLOUCESTER:
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
GLOUCESTER:
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor
GLOUCESTER:
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
GLOUCESTER:
I will not dine until I see the same.
GLOUCESTER:
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done
GLOUCESTER:
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt all but HASTINGS, RATCLIFF, and LOVEL
HASTINGS:
Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me,
HASTINGS:
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
HASTINGS:
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm,
HASTINGS:
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly
HASTINGS:
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
HASTINGS:
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
HASTINGS:
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
HASTINGS:
O, now I want the priest that spake to me
HASTINGS:
I now repent I told the pursuivant
HASTINGS:
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
HASTINGS:
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
HASTINGS:
And I myself secure in grace and favour.
HASTINGS:
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
HASTINGS:
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, my lord, the duke would be at dinner
RATCLIFF:
Make a short shrift, he longs to see your head.
HASTINGS:
O momentary grace of mortal men,
HASTINGS:
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
HASTINGS:
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
HASTINGS:
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
HASTINGS:
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
HASTINGS:
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
LOVEL:
Come, come, dispatch, 'tis bootless to exclaim.
HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! miserable England!
HASTINGS:
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
HASTINGS:
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
HASTINGS:
Come, lead me to the block, bear him my head.
HASTINGS:
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
HASTINGS:
Exeunt
HASTINGS:
SCENE V. The Tower-walls.
HASTINGS:
Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour, marvellous ill-favoured
GLOUCESTER:
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
GLOUCESTER:
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
GLOUCESTER:
And then begin again, and stop again,
GLOUCESTER:
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian,
BUCKINGHAM:
Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
BUCKINGHAM:
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
BUCKINGHAM:
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
BUCKINGHAM:
Are at my service, like enforced smiles,
BUCKINGHAM:
And both are ready in their offices,
BUCKINGHAM:
At any time, to grace my stratagems.
BUCKINGHAM:
But what, is Catesby gone?
GLOUCESTER:
He is, and, see, he brings the mayor along.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--
GLOUCESTER:
Look to the drawbridge there!
BUCKINGHAM:
Hark! a drum.
GLOUCESTER:
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
GLOUCESTER:
Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
BUCKINGHAM:
God and our innocency defend and guard us!
GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head
LOVEL:
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
LOVEL:
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
GLOUCESTER:
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
GLOUCESTER:
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
GLOUCESTER:
That breathed upon this earth a Christian,
GLOUCESTER:
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
GLOUCESTER:
The history of all her secret thoughts
GLOUCESTER:
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
GLOUCESTER:
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
GLOUCESTER:
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
GLOUCESTER:
He lived from all attainder of suspect.
BUCKINGHAM:
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
BUCKINGHAM:
That ever lived.
BUCKINGHAM:
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
BUCKINGHAM:
Were't not that, by great preservation,
BUCKINGHAM:
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
BUCKINGHAM:
This day had plotted, in the council-house
BUCKINGHAM:
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
Lord Mayor:
What, had he so?
GLOUCESTER:
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
GLOUCESTER:
Or that we would, against the form of law,
GLOUCESTER:
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
GLOUCESTER:
But that the extreme peril of the case,
GLOUCESTER:
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
GLOUCESTER:
Enforced us to this execution?
Lord Mayor:
Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death,
Lord Mayor:
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
Lord Mayor:
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
Lord Mayor:
I never look'd for better at his hands,
Lord Mayor:
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
GLOUCESTER:
Yet had not we determined he should die,
GLOUCESTER:
Until your lordship came to see his death,
GLOUCESTER:
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
GLOUCESTER:
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented
GLOUCESTER:
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
GLOUCESTER:
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
GLOUCESTER:
The manner and the purpose of his treason,
GLOUCESTER:
That you might well have signified the same
GLOUCESTER:
Unto the citizens, who haply may
GLOUCESTER:
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
Lord Mayor:
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
Lord Mayor:
As well as I had seen and heard him speak
Lord Mayor:
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
Lord Mayor:
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
Lord Mayor:
With all your just proceedings in this cause.
GLOUCESTER:
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
GLOUCESTER:
To avoid the carping censures of the world.
BUCKINGHAM:
But since you come too late of our intents,
BUCKINGHAM:
Yet witness what you hear we did intend
BUCKINGHAM:
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exit Lord Mayor
GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
GLOUCESTER:
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post
GLOUCESTER:
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
GLOUCESTER:
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children
GLOUCESTER:
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
GLOUCESTER:
Only for saying he would make his son
GLOUCESTER:
Heir to the crown, meaning indeed his house,
GLOUCESTER:
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
GLOUCESTER:
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
GLOUCESTER:
And bestial appetite in change of lust,
GLOUCESTER:
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
GLOUCESTER:
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
GLOUCESTER:
Without control, listed to make his prey.
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person
GLOUCESTER:
Tell them, when that my mother went with child
GLOUCESTER:
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
GLOUCESTER:
My princely father then had wars in France
GLOUCESTER:
And, by just computation of the time,
GLOUCESTER:
Found that the issue was not his begot,
GLOUCESTER:
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
GLOUCESTER:
Being nothing like the noble duke my father
GLOUCESTER:
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
GLOUCESTER:
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
BUCKINGHAM:
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
BUCKINGHAM:
As if the golden fee for which I plead
BUCKINGHAM:
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
GLOUCESTER:
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle,
GLOUCESTER:
Where you shall find me well accompanied
GLOUCESTER:
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
BUCKINGHAM:
I go: and towards three or four o'clock
BUCKINGHAM:
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exit BUCKINGHAM
GLOUCESTER:
Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw,
GLOUCESTER:
To CATESBY
GLOUCESTER:
Go thou to Friar Penker, bid them both
GLOUCESTER:
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
Now will I in, to take some privy order,
GLOUCESTER:
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,
GLOUCESTER:
And to give notice, that no manner of person
GLOUCESTER:
At any time have recourse unto the princes.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE VI. The same.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter a Scrivener, with a paper in his hand
Scrivener:
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings,
Scrivener:
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
Scrivener:
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
Scrivener:
And mark how well the sequel hangs together
Scrivener:
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
Scrivener:
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me,
Scrivener:
The precedent was full as long a-doing
Scrivener:
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
Scrivener:
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
Scrivener:
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
Scrivener:
That seeth not this palpable device?
Scrivener:
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
Scrivener:
Bad is the world, and all will come to nought,
Scrivener:
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.
Scrivener:
Exit
Scrivener:
SCENE VII. Baynard's Castle.
Scrivener:
Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors
GLOUCESTER:
How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
BUCKINGHAM:
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
GLOUCESTER:
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
BUCKINGHAM:
I did, with his contract with Lady Lucy,
BUCKINGHAM:
And his contract by deputy in France,
BUCKINGHAM:
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
BUCKINGHAM:
And his enforcement of the city wives,
BUCKINGHAM:
His tyranny for trifles, his own bastardy,
BUCKINGHAM:
As being got, your father then in France,
BUCKINGHAM:
His resemblance, being not like the duke,
BUCKINGHAM:
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
BUCKINGHAM:
Being the right idea of your father,
BUCKINGHAM:
Both in your form and nobleness of mind,
BUCKINGHAM:
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
BUCKINGHAM:
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
BUCKINGHAM:
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility
BUCKINGHAM:
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
BUCKINGHAM:
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
BUCKINGHAM:
And when mine oratory grew to an end
BUCKINGHAM:
I bid them that did love their country's good
BUCKINGHAM:
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
GLOUCESTER:
Ah! and did they so?
BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God help me, they spake not a word,
BUCKINGHAM:
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
BUCKINGHAM:
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
BUCKINGHAM:
Which when I saw, I reprehended them,
BUCKINGHAM:
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence
BUCKINGHAM:
His answer was, the people were not wont
BUCKINGHAM:
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
BUCKINGHAM:
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
BUCKINGHAM:
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd,'
BUCKINGHAM:
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
BUCKINGHAM:
When he had done, some followers of mine own,
BUCKINGHAM:
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
BUCKINGHAM:
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
BUCKINGHAM:
And thus I took the vantage of those few,
BUCKINGHAM:
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I,
BUCKINGHAM:
'This general applause and loving shout
BUCKINGHAM:
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
BUCKINGHAM:
And even here brake off, and came away.
GLOUCESTER:
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my troth, my lord.
GLOUCESTER:
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear,
BUCKINGHAM:
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit
BUCKINGHAM:
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
BUCKINGHAM:
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord,
BUCKINGHAM:
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant
BUCKINGHAM:
And be not easily won to our request
BUCKINGHAM:
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
GLOUCESTER:
I go, and if you plead as well for them
GLOUCESTER:
As I can say nay to thee for myself,
GLOUCESTER:
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
BUCKINGHAM:
Go, go, up to the leads, the lord mayor knocks.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exit GLOUCESTER
BUCKINGHAM:
Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens
BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome my lord, I dance attendance here,
BUCKINGHAM:
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
BUCKINGHAM:
Enter CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM:
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
BUCKINGHAM:
What says he?
CATESBY:
My lord: he doth entreat your grace,
CATESBY:
To visit him to-morrow or next day
CATESBY:
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
CATESBY:
Divinely bent to meditation,
CATESBY:
And no worldly suit would he be moved,
CATESBY:
To draw him from his holy exercise.
BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again,
BUCKINGHAM:
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
BUCKINGHAM:
In deep designs and matters of great moment,
BUCKINGHAM:
No less importing than our general good,
BUCKINGHAM:
Are come to have some conference with his grace.
CATESBY:
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
CATESBY:
Exit
BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
BUCKINGHAM:
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
BUCKINGHAM:
But on his knees at meditation,
BUCKINGHAM:
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
BUCKINGHAM:
But meditating with two deep divines,
BUCKINGHAM:
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
BUCKINGHAM:
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul
BUCKINGHAM:
Happy were England, would this gracious prince
BUCKINGHAM:
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof
BUCKINGHAM:
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.
Lord Mayor:
Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!
BUCKINGHAM:
I fear he will.
BUCKINGHAM:
Re-enter CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM:
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
CATESBY:
My lord,
CATESBY:
He wonders to what end you have assembled
CATESBY:
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
CATESBY:
His grace not being warn'd thereof before
CATESBY:
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
BUCKINGHAM:
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
BUCKINGHAM:
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him
BUCKINGHAM:
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him,
BUCKINGHAM:
And so once more return and tell his grace.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exit CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM:
When holy and devout religious men
BUCKINGHAM:
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
BUCKINGHAM:
So sweet is zealous contemplation.
BUCKINGHAM:
Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returns
Lord Mayor:
See, where he stands between two clergymen!
BUCKINGHAM:
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
BUCKINGHAM:
To stay him from the fall of vanity
BUCKINGHAM:
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
BUCKINGHAM:
True ornaments to know a holy man.
BUCKINGHAM:
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
BUCKINGHAM:
Lend favourable ears to our request,
BUCKINGHAM:
And pardon us the interruption
BUCKINGHAM:
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
GLOUCESTER:
My lord, there needs no such apology
GLOUCESTER:
I rather do beseech you pardon me,
GLOUCESTER:
Who, earnest in the service of my God,
GLOUCESTER:
Neglect the visitation of my friends.
GLOUCESTER:
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
BUCKINGHAM:
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
BUCKINGHAM:
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have done some offence
GLOUCESTER:
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
GLOUCESTER:
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
BUCKINGHAM:
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
BUCKINGHAM:
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!
GLOUCESTER:
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, it is your fault that you resign
BUCKINGHAM:
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
BUCKINGHAM:
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
BUCKINGHAM:
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
BUCKINGHAM:
The lineal glory of your royal house,
BUCKINGHAM:
To the corruption of a blemished stock
BUCKINGHAM:
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
BUCKINGHAM:
Which here we waken to our country's good,
BUCKINGHAM:
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs,
BUCKINGHAM:
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
BUCKINGHAM:
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
BUCKINGHAM:
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
BUCKINGHAM:
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
BUCKINGHAM:
Which to recure, we heartily solicit
BUCKINGHAM:
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
BUCKINGHAM:
And kingly government of this your land,
BUCKINGHAM:
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
BUCKINGHAM:
Or lowly factor for another's gain,
BUCKINGHAM:
But as successively from blood to blood,
BUCKINGHAM:
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
BUCKINGHAM:
For this, consorted with the citizens,
BUCKINGHAM:
Your very worshipful and loving friends,
BUCKINGHAM:
And by their vehement instigation,
BUCKINGHAM:
In this just suit come I to move your grace.
GLOUCESTER:
I know not whether to depart in silence,
GLOUCESTER:
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
GLOUCESTER:
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
GLOUCESTER:
If not to answer, you might haply think
GLOUCESTER:
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
GLOUCESTER:
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
GLOUCESTER:
Which fondly you would here impose on me,
GLOUCESTER:
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
GLOUCESTER:
So season'd with your faithful love to me.
GLOUCESTER:
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
GLOUCESTER:
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
GLOUCESTER:
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
GLOUCESTER:
Definitively thus I answer you.
GLOUCESTER:
Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert
GLOUCESTER:
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
GLOUCESTER:
First if all obstacles were cut away,
GLOUCESTER:
And that my path were even to the crown,
GLOUCESTER:
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
GLOUCESTER:
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
GLOUCESTER:
So mighty and so many my defects,
GLOUCESTER:
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
GLOUCESTER:
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
GLOUCESTER:
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
GLOUCESTER:
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
GLOUCESTER:
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
GLOUCESTER:
And much I need to help you, if need were,
GLOUCESTER:
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
GLOUCESTER:
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
GLOUCESTER:
Will well become the seat of majesty,
GLOUCESTER:
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
GLOUCESTER:
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
GLOUCESTER:
The right and fortune of his happy stars,
GLOUCESTER:
Which God defend that I should wring from him!
BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace,
BUCKINGHAM:
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
BUCKINGHAM:
All circumstances well considered.
BUCKINGHAM:
You say that Edward is your brother's son
BUCKINGHAM:
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife,
BUCKINGHAM:
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
BUCKINGHAM:
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
BUCKINGHAM:
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
BUCKINGHAM:
To Bona, sister to the King of France.
BUCKINGHAM:
These both put by a poor petitioner,
BUCKINGHAM:
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
BUCKINGHAM:
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
BUCKINGHAM:
Even in the afternoon of her best days,
BUCKINGHAM:
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
BUCKINGHAM:
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
BUCKINGHAM:
To base declension and loathed bigamy
BUCKINGHAM:
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
BUCKINGHAM:
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
BUCKINGHAM:
More bitterly could I expostulate,
BUCKINGHAM:
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
BUCKINGHAM:
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
BUCKINGHAM:
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
BUCKINGHAM:
This proffer'd benefit of dignity,
BUCKINGHAM:
If non to bless us and the land withal,
BUCKINGHAM:
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
BUCKINGHAM:
From the corruption of abusing times,
BUCKINGHAM:
Unto a lineal true-derived course.
Lord Mayor:
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
CATESBY:
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
GLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
GLOUCESTER:
I am unfit for state and majesty,
GLOUCESTER:
I do beseech you, take it not amiss,
GLOUCESTER:
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
BUCKINGHAM:
If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
BUCKINGHAM:
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son,
BUCKINGHAM:
As well we know your tenderness of heart
BUCKINGHAM:
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
BUCKINGHAM:
Which we have noted in you to your kin,
BUCKINGHAM:
And egally indeed to all estates,--
BUCKINGHAM:
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
BUCKINGHAM:
Your brother's son shall never reign our king,
BUCKINGHAM:
But we will plant some other in the throne,
BUCKINGHAM:
To the disgrace and downfall of your house
BUCKINGHAM:
And in this resolution here we leave you.--
BUCKINGHAM:
Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.
GLOUCESTER:
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens
CATESBY:
Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.
ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
GLOUCESTER:
Would you enforce me to a world of care?
GLOUCESTER:
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
GLOUCESTER:
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
GLOUCESTER:
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
GLOUCESTER:
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest
GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
GLOUCESTER:
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
GLOUCESTER:
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
GLOUCESTER:
I must have patience to endure the load
GLOUCESTER:
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
GLOUCESTER:
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
GLOUCESTER:
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
GLOUCESTER:
From all the impure blots and stains thereof,
GLOUCESTER:
For God he knows, and you may partly see,
GLOUCESTER:
How far I am from the desire thereof.
Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
GLOUCESTER:
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
BUCKINGHAM:
Then I salute you with this kingly title
BUCKINGHAM:
Long live Richard, England's royal king!
Citizens:
Amen.
BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
GLOUCESTER:
Even when you please, since you will have it so.
BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace
BUCKINGHAM:
And so most joyfully we take our leave.
GLOUCESTER:
Come, let us to our holy task again.
GLOUCESTER:
Farewell, good cousin, farewell, gentle friends.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt
GLOUCESTER:
ACT IV
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE I. Before the Tower.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter, on one side, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF  YORK, and DORSET, on the other, ANNE, Duchess of  Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet, CLARENCE's young Daughter
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who m eets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Daughter, well met.
LADY ANNE:
God give your graces both
LADY ANNE:
A happy and a joyful time of day!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
LADY ANNE:
No farther than the Tower, and, as I guess,
LADY ANNE:
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
LADY ANNE:
To gratulate the gentle princes there.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Enter BRAKENBURY
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
BRAKENBURY:
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
BRAKENBURY:
I may not suffer you to visit them,
BRAKENBURY:
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king! why, who's that?
BRAKENBURY:
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I am their mother, who should keep me from them?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their fathers mother, I will see them.
LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother
LADY ANNE:
Then bring me to their sights, I'll bear thy blame
LADY ANNE:
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no, I may not leave it so
BRAKENBURY:
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
BRAKENBURY:
Exit
BRAKENBURY:
Enter LORD STANLEY
LORD STANLEY:
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
LORD STANLEY:
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
LORD STANLEY:
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
LORD STANLEY:
To LADY ANNE
LORD STANLEY:
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
LORD STANLEY:
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With this dead-killing news!
LADY ANNE:
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
DORSET:
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
LORD STANLEY:
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
LORD STANLEY:
Take all the swift advantage of the hours,
LORD STANLEY:
You shall have letters from me to my son
LORD STANLEY:
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
LORD STANLEY:
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
LORD STANLEY:
Come, madam, come, I in all haste was sent.
LADY ANNE:
And I in all unwillingness will go.
LADY ANNE:
I would to God that the inclusive verge
LADY ANNE:
Of golden metal that must round my brow
LADY ANNE:
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
LADY ANNE:
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
LADY ANNE:
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
LADY ANNE:
No! why?  When he that is my husband now
LADY ANNE:
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
LADY ANNE:
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
LADY ANNE:
Which issued from my other angel husband
LADY ANNE:
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd,
LADY ANNE:
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
LADY ANNE:
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
LADY ANNE:
For making me, so young, so old a widow!
LADY ANNE:
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed,
LADY ANNE:
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
LADY ANNE:
As miserable by the life of thee
LADY ANNE:
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
LADY ANNE:
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
LADY ANNE:
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
LADY ANNE:
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
LADY ANNE:
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
LADY ANNE:
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest,
LADY ANNE:
For never yet one hour in his bed
LADY ANNE:
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
LADY ANNE:
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
LADY ANNE:
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick,
LADY ANNE:
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
LADY ANNE:
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
LADY ANNE:
Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
[To DORSET]
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
To LADY ANNE
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
To QUEEN ELIZABETH
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For tender princes, use my babies well!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Exeunt
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
SCENE II. London. The palace.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Sennet. Enter KING RICHARD III, in pomp, crowned, BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY, a page, and others
KING RICHARD III:
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious sovereign?
KING RICHARD III:
Give me thy hand.
KING RICHARD III:
Here he ascendeth his throne
KING RICHARD III:
Thus high, by thy advice
KING RICHARD III:
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated,
KING RICHARD III:
But shall we wear these honours for a day?
KING RICHARD III:
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
BUCKINGHAM:
Still live they and for ever may they last!
KING RICHARD III:
O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
KING RICHARD III:
To try if thou be current gold indeed
KING RICHARD III:
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
BUCKINGHAM:
Say on, my loving lord.
KING RICHARD III:
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,
BUCKINGHAM:
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.
KING RICHARD III:
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
BUCKINGHAM:
True, noble prince.
KING RICHARD III:
O bitter consequence,
KING RICHARD III:
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
KING RICHARD III:
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull
KING RICHARD III:
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead,
KING RICHARD III:
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
KING RICHARD III:
What sayest thou? speak suddenly, be brief.
BUCKINGHAM:
Your grace may do your pleasure.
KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth
KING RICHARD III:
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
BUCKINGHAM:
Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
BUCKINGHAM:
Before I positively herein
BUCKINGHAM:
I will resolve your grace immediately.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exit
CATESBY:
[Aside to a stander by]
CATESBY:
The king is angry: see, he bites the lip.
KING RICHARD III:
I will converse with iron-witted fools
KING RICHARD III:
And unrespective boys: none are for me
KING RICHARD III:
That look into me with considerate eyes
KING RICHARD III:
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
KING RICHARD III:
Boy!
Page:
My lord?
KING RICHARD III:
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
KING RICHARD III:
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
Page:
My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
Page:
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind
Page:
Gold were as good as twenty orators,
Page:
And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.
KING RICHARD III:
What is his name?
Page:
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
KING RICHARD III:
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
KING RICHARD III:
Exit Page
KING RICHARD III:
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
KING RICHARD III:
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel
KING RICHARD III:
Hath he so long held out with me untired,
KING RICHARD III:
And stops he now for breath?
KING RICHARD III:
Enter STANLEY
KING RICHARD III:
How now! what news with you?
STANLEY:
My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
STANLEY:
To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
STANLEY:
Where he abides.
STANLEY:
Stands apart
KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!
CATESBY:
My lord?
KING RICHARD III:
Rumour it abroad
KING RICHARD III:
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die
KING RICHARD III:
I will take order for her keeping close.
KING RICHARD III:
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
KING RICHARD III:
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter
KING RICHARD III:
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
KING RICHARD III:
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
KING RICHARD III:
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die
KING RICHARD III:
About it, for it stands me much upon,
KING RICHARD III:
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
KING RICHARD III:
Exit CATESBY
KING RICHARD III:
I must be married to my brother's daughter,
KING RICHARD III:
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
KING RICHARD III:
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
KING RICHARD III:
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
KING RICHARD III:
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin
KING RICHARD III:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
KING RICHARD III:
Re-enter Page, with TYRREL
KING RICHARD III:
Is thy name Tyrrel?
TYRREL:
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
KING RICHARD III:
Art thou, indeed?
TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
KING RICHARD III:
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
TYRREL:
Ay, my lord,
TYRREL:
But I had rather kill two enemies.
KING RICHARD III:
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
KING RICHARD III:
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
KING RICHARD III:
Are they that I would have thee deal upon
KING RICHARD III:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
TYRREL:
Let me have open means to come to them,
TYRREL:
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
KING RICHARD III:
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
KING RICHARD III:
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear
KING RICHARD III:
Whispers
KING RICHARD III:
There is no more but so: say it is done,
KING RICHARD III:
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
TYRREL:
'Tis done, my gracious lord.
KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
TYRREL:
Ye shall, my Lord.
TYRREL:
Exit
TYRREL:
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
BUCKINGHAM:
The late demand that you did sound me in.
KING RICHARD III:
Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
BUCKINGHAM:
I hear that news, my lord.
KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
BUCKINGHAM:
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd,
BUCKINGHAM:
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
BUCKINGHAM:
The which you promised I should possess.
KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, look to your wife, if she convey
KING RICHARD III:
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
BUCKINGHAM:
What says your highness to my just demand?
KING RICHARD III:
As I remember, Henry the Sixth
KING RICHARD III:
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
KING RICHARD III:
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
KING RICHARD III:
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!
KING RICHARD III:
How chance the prophet could not at that time
KING RICHARD III:
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
KING RICHARD III:
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
KING RICHARD III:
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
KING RICHARD III:
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
KING RICHARD III:
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
KING RICHARD III:
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!
KING RICHARD III:
Ay, what's o'clock?
BUCKINGHAM:
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
BUCKINGHAM:
Of what you promised me.
KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's o'clock?
BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the stroke of ten.
KING RICHARD III:
Well, let it strike.
BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike?
KING RICHARD III:
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
KING RICHARD III:
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
KING RICHARD III:
I am not in the giving vein to-day.
BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut,
KING RICHARD III:
Thou troublest me, am not in the vein.
KING RICHARD III:
Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM:
Is it even so? rewards he my true service
BUCKINGHAM:
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
BUCKINGHAM:
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
BUCKINGHAM:
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
BUCKINGHAM:
Exit
BUCKINGHAM:
SCENE III. The same.
BUCKINGHAM:
Enter TYRREL
TYRREL:
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
TYRREL:
The most arch of piteous massacre
TYRREL:
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
TYRREL:
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
TYRREL:
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
TYRREL:
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
TYRREL:
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
TYRREL:
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
TYRREL:
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
TYRREL:
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
TYRREL:
Within their innocent alabaster arms
TYRREL:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
TYRREL:
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
TYRREL:
A book of prayers on their pillow lay,
TYRREL:
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind,
TYRREL:
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
TYRREL:
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
TYRREL:
The most replenished sweet work of nature,
TYRREL:
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
TYRREL:
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse,
TYRREL:
They could not speak, and so I left them both,
TYRREL:
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
TYRREL:
And here he comes.
TYRREL:
Enter KING RICHARD III
TYRREL:
All hail, my sovereign liege!
KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
TYRREL:
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
TYRREL:
Beget your happiness, be happy then,
TYRREL:
For it is done, my lord.
KING RICHARD III:
But didst thou see them dead?
TYRREL:
I did, my lord.
KING RICHARD III:
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
TYRREL:
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them,
TYRREL:
But how or in what place I do not know.
KING RICHARD III:
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
KING RICHARD III:
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
KING RICHARD III:
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
KING RICHARD III:
And be inheritor of thy desire.
KING RICHARD III:
Farewell till soon.
KING RICHARD III:
Exit TYRREL
KING RICHARD III:
The son of Clarence have I pent up close,
KING RICHARD III:
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage,
KING RICHARD III:
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
KING RICHARD III:
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
KING RICHARD III:
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
KING RICHARD III:
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
KING RICHARD III:
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
KING RICHARD III:
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
KING RICHARD III:
Enter CATESBY
CATESBY:
My lord!
KING RICHARD III:
Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?
CATESBY:
Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond,
CATESBY:
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
CATESBY:
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
KING RICHARD III:
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
KING RICHARD III:
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
KING RICHARD III:
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
KING RICHARD III:
Is leaden servitor to dull delay,
KING RICHARD III:
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
KING RICHARD III:
Then fiery expedition be my wing,
KING RICHARD III:
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
KING RICHARD III:
Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield,
KING RICHARD III:
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
KING RICHARD III:
Exeunt
KING RICHARD III:
SCENE IV. Before the palace.
KING RICHARD III:
Enter QUEEN MARGARET
QUEEN MARGARET:
So, now prosperity begins to mellow
QUEEN MARGARET:
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
QUEEN MARGARET:
A dire induction am I witness to,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And will to France, hoping the consequence
QUEEN MARGARET:
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hover about me with your airy wings
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And hear your mother's lamentation!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hover about her, say, that right for right
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
So many miseries have crazed my voice,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
QUEEN MARGARET:
When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Sitting down
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Sitting down by her
QUEEN MARGARET:
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Give mine the benefit of seniory,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
QUEEN MARGARET:
If sorrow can admit society,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Sitting down with them
QUEEN MARGARET:
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine
QUEEN MARGARET:
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
QUEEN MARGARET:
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
QUEEN MARGARET:
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death
QUEEN MARGARET:
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
QUEEN MARGARET:
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
QUEEN MARGARET:
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Bear with me, I am hungry for revenge,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Young York he is but boot, because both they
QUEEN MARGARET:
Match not the high perfection of my loss
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And the beholders of this tragic play,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
QUEEN MARGARET:
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end
QUEEN MARGARET:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
QUEEN MARGARET:
To have him suddenly convey'd away.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
QUEEN MARGARET:
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The presentation of but what I was,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The flattering index of a direful pageant,
QUEEN MARGARET:
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below,
QUEEN MARGARET:
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes,
QUEEN MARGARET:
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
QUEEN MARGARET:
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
QUEEN MARGARET:
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Decline all this, and see what now thou art
QUEEN MARGARET:
For happy wife, a most distressed widow,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For joyful mother, one that wails the name,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And left thee but a very prey to time,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
QUEEN MARGARET:
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke,
QUEEN MARGARET:
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance
QUEEN MARGARET:
These English woes will make me smile in France.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Compare dead happiness with living woe,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And he that slew them fouler than he is
QUEEN MARGARET:
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse
QUEEN MARGARET:
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are dull, O, quicken them with thine!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Exit
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why should calamity be full of words?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorneys to their client woes,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor breathing orators of miseries!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Let them have scope: though what they do impart
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
DUCHESS OF YORK:
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Enter KING RICHARD III, marching, with drums and trumpets
KING RICHARD III:
Who intercepts my expedition?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she that might have intercepted thee,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
By strangling thee in her accursed womb
DUCHESS OF YORK:
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where should be graven, if that right were right,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
KING RICHARD III:
A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
KING RICHARD III:
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
KING RICHARD III:
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
KING RICHARD III:
Flourish. Alarums
KING RICHARD III:
Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
KING RICHARD III:
Or with the clamorous report of war
KING RICHARD III:
Thus will I drown your exclamations.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou my son?
KING RICHARD III:
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Then patiently hear my impatience.
KING RICHARD III:
Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
KING RICHARD III:
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, let me speak!
KING RICHARD III:
Do then: but I'll not hear.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
KING RICHARD III:
And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
KING RICHARD III:
And came I not at last to comfort you?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
treacherous,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred
DUCHESS OF YORK:
What comfortable hour canst thou name,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
That ever graced me in thy company?
KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
KING RICHARD III:
your grace
KING RICHARD III:
To breakfast once forth of my company.
KING RICHARD III:
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
KING RICHARD III:
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
KING RICHARD III:
Strike the drum.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, hear me speak.
KING RICHARD III:
You speak too bitterly.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hear me a word,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
For I shall never speak to thee again.
KING RICHARD III:
So.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And never look upon thy face again.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
DUCHESS OF YORK:
My prayers on the adverse party fight,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And there the little souls of Edward's children
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
DUCHESS OF YORK:
And promise them success and victory.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end,
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Exit
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Abides in me, I say amen to all.
KING RICHARD III:
Stay, madam, I must speak a word with you.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I have no more sons of the royal blood
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And therefore level not to hit their lives.
KING RICHARD III:
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
KING RICHARD III:
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And must she die for this? O, let her live,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Throw over her the veil of infamy
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
KING RICHARD III:
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
KING RICHARD III:
Her life is only safest in her birth.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And only in that safety died her brothers.
KING RICHARD III:
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
KING RICHARD III:
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
KING RICHARD III:
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozen'd
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
KING RICHARD III:
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
KING RICHARD III:
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
KING RICHARD III:
As I intend more good to you and yours,
KING RICHARD III:
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To be discover'd, that can do me good?
KING RICHARD III:
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
KING RICHARD III:
No, to the dignity and height of honour
KING RICHARD III:
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Flatter my sorrows with report of it,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
KING RICHARD III:
Even all I have, yea, and myself and all,
KING RICHARD III:
Will I withal endow a child of thine,
KING RICHARD III:
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
KING RICHARD III:
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
KING RICHARD III:
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
KING RICHARD III:
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
KING RICHARD III:
What do you think?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
KING RICHARD III:
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning
KING RICHARD III:
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
KING RICHARD III:
And mean to make her queen of England.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
KING RICHARD III:
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What, thou?
KING RICHARD III:
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How canst thou woo her?
KING RICHARD III:
That would I learn of you,
KING RICHARD III:
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And wilt thou learn of me?
KING RICHARD III:
Madam, with all my heart.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A pair of bleeding-hearts, thereon engrave
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Edward and York, then haply she will weep
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A handkerchief, which, say to her, did drain
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If this inducement force her not to love,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Send her a story of thy noble acts,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Her uncle Rivers, yea, and, for her sake,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
KING RICHARD III:
Come, come, you mock me, this is not the way
KING RICHARD III:
To win our daughter.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There is no other way
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And not be Richard that hath done all this.
KING RICHARD III:
Say that I did all this for love of her.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
KING RICHARD III:
Look, what is done cannot be now amended
KING RICHARD III:
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
KING RICHARD III:
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
KING RICHARD III:
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
KING RICHARD III:
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
KING RICHARD III:
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
KING RICHARD III:
To quicken your increase, I will beget
KING RICHARD III:
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
KING RICHARD III:
A grandam's name is little less in love
KING RICHARD III:
Than is the doting title of a mother,
KING RICHARD III:
They are as children but one step below,
KING RICHARD III:
Even of your mettle, of your very blood,
KING RICHARD III:
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
KING RICHARD III:
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
KING RICHARD III:
Your children were vexation to your youth,
KING RICHARD III:
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
KING RICHARD III:
The loss you have is but a son being king,
KING RICHARD III:
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
KING RICHARD III:
I cannot make you what amends I would,
KING RICHARD III:
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
KING RICHARD III:
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
KING RICHARD III:
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
KING RICHARD III:
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
KING RICHARD III:
To high promotions and great dignity
KING RICHARD III:
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
KING RICHARD III:
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother,
KING RICHARD III:
Again shall you be mother to a king,
KING RICHARD III:
And all the ruins of distressful times
KING RICHARD III:
Repair'd with double riches of content.
KING RICHARD III:
What! we have many goodly days to see
KING RICHARD III:
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
KING RICHARD III:
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
KING RICHARD III:
Advantaging their loan with interest
KING RICHARD III:
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
KING RICHARD III:
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
KING RICHARD III:
Make bold her bashful years with your experience,
KING RICHARD III:
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
KING RICHARD III:
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
KING RICHARD III:
Of golden sovereignty, acquaint the princess
KING RICHARD III:
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
KING RICHARD III:
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
KING RICHARD III:
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
KING RICHARD III:
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
KING RICHARD III:
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed,
KING RICHARD III:
To whom I will retail my conquest won,
KING RICHARD III:
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What were I best to say? her father's brother
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Under what title shall I woo for thee,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That God, the law, my honour and her love,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
KING RICHARD III:
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
KING RICHARD III:
Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
KING RICHARD III:
Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
KING RICHARD III:
Say, I will love her everlastingly.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
KING RICHARD III:
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
KING RICHARD III:
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
KING RICHARD III:
Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
KING RICHARD III:
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
KING RICHARD III:
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
KING RICHARD III:
Harp not on that string, madam, that is past.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
KING RICHARD III:
Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
KING RICHARD III:
I swear--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By nothing, for this is no oath
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
KING RICHARD III:
Now, by the world--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
KING RICHARD III:
My father's death--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
KING RICHARD III:
Then, by myself--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thyself thyself misusest.
KING RICHARD III:
Why then, by God--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God's wrong is most of all.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The unity the king thy brother made
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Had graced the tender temples of my child,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And both the princes had been breathing here,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What canst thou swear by now?
KING RICHARD III:
The time to come.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For I myself have many tears to wash
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The children live, whose parents thou hast
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
slaughter'd,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
KING RICHARD III:
As I intend to prosper and repent,
KING RICHARD III:
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
KING RICHARD III:
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
KING RICHARD III:
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
KING RICHARD III:
Day, yield me not thy light, nor, night, thy rest!
KING RICHARD III:
Be opposite all planets of good luck
KING RICHARD III:
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
KING RICHARD III:
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
KING RICHARD III:
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
KING RICHARD III:
In her consists my happiness and thine,
KING RICHARD III:
Without her, follows to this land and me,
KING RICHARD III:
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
KING RICHARD III:
Death, desolation, ruin and decay
KING RICHARD III:
It cannot be avoided but by this,
KING RICHARD III:
It will not be avoided but by this.
KING RICHARD III:
Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
KING RICHARD III:
Be the attorney of my love to her
KING RICHARD III:
Plead what I will be, not what I have been,
KING RICHARD III:
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve
KING RICHARD III:
Urge the necessity and state of times,
KING RICHARD III:
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I forget myself to be myself?
KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But thou didst kill my children.
KING RICHARD III:
But in your daughter's womb I bury them
KING RICHARD III:
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
KING RICHARD III:
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
KING RICHARD III:
And be a happy mother by the deed.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I go. Write to me very shortly.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And you shall understand from me her mind.
KING RICHARD III:
Bear her my true love's kiss, and so, farewell.
KING RICHARD III:
Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
KING RICHARD III:
Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
KING RICHARD III:
Enter RATCLIFF, CATESBY following
KING RICHARD III:
How now! what news?
RATCLIFF:
My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
RATCLIFF:
Rideth a puissant navy, to the shore
RATCLIFF:
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
RATCLIFF:
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back
RATCLIFF:
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral,
RATCLIFF:
And there they hull, expecting but the aid
RATCLIFF:
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
KING RICHARD III:
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk
KING RICHARD III:
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby, where is he?
CATESBY:
Here, my lord.
KING RICHARD III:
Fly to the duke
KING RICHARD III:
To RATCLIFF
KING RICHARD III:
Post thou to Salisbury
KING RICHARD III:
When thou comest thither--
KING RICHARD III:
To CATESBY
KING RICHARD III:
Dull, unmindful villain,
KING RICHARD III:
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?
CATESBY:
First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
CATESBY:
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
KING RICHARD III:
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
KING RICHARD III:
The greatest strength and power he can make,
KING RICHARD III:
And meet me presently at Salisbury.
CATESBY:
I go.
CATESBY:
Exit
RATCLIFF:
What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
RATCLIFF:
Salisbury?
KING RICHARD III:
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
RATCLIFF:
Your highness told me I should post before.
KING RICHARD III:
My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
KING RICHARD III:
Enter STANLEY
KING RICHARD III:
How now, what news with you?
STANLEY:
None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing,
STANLEY:
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
KING RICHARD III:
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
KING RICHARD III:
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
KING RICHARD III:
Once more, what news?
STANLEY:
Richmond is on the seas.
KING RICHARD III:
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
KING RICHARD III:
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
STANLEY:
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
KING RICHARD III:
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
STANLEY:
Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
STANLEY:
He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
KING RICHARD III:
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
KING RICHARD III:
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
KING RICHARD III:
What heir of York is there alive but we?
KING RICHARD III:
And who is England's king but great York's heir?
KING RICHARD III:
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
STANLEY:
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
KING RICHARD III:
Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
KING RICHARD III:
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
KING RICHARD III:
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.
STANLEY:
No, mighty liege, therefore mistrust me not.
KING RICHARD III:
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
KING RICHARD III:
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
KING RICHARD III:
Are they not now upon the western shore.
KING RICHARD III:
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
STANLEY:
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
KING RICHARD III:
Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
KING RICHARD III:
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
STANLEY:
They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign
STANLEY:
Please it your majesty to give me leave,
STANLEY:
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
STANLEY:
Where and what time your majesty shall please.
KING RICHARD III:
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond
KING RICHARD III:
I will not trust you, sir.
STANLEY:
Most mighty sovereign,
STANLEY:
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful
STANLEY:
I never was nor never will be false.
KING RICHARD III:
Well,
KING RICHARD III:
Go muster men, but, hear you, leave behind
KING RICHARD III:
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
KING RICHARD III:
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
STANLEY:
So deal with him as I prove true to you.
STANLEY:
Exit

Third Messenger:
The news I have to tell your majesty
Third Messenger:
Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
Third Messenger:
Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd,
Third Messenger:
And he himself wander'd away alone,
Third Messenger:
No man knows whither.
KING RICHARD III:
I cry thee mercy
KING RICHARD III:
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
KING RICHARD III:
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
KING RICHARD III:
Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
Third Messenger:
Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
Third Messenger:
Enter another Messenger

Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
Fourth Messenger:
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
Fourth Messenger:
If they were his assistants, yea or no,
Fourth Messenger:
Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
Fourth Messenger:
Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
Fourth Messenger:
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.
KING RICHARD III:

Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

Re-enter CATESBY

KING RICHARD III:
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
KING RICHARD III:
A royal battle might be won and lost
KING RICHARD III:
Some one take order Buckingham be brought
KING RICHARD III:
To Salisbury, the rest march on with me.
KING RICHARD III:
Flourish. Exeunt

KING RICHARD III:
Enter DERBY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK
DERBY:
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me
DERBY:
That in the sty of this most bloody boar
DERBY:
My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold
DERBY:
If I revolt, off goes young George's head,
DERBY:
The fear of that withholds my present aid.
DERBY:
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
DERBY:
What men of name resort to him?
CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier,

Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
CHRISTOPHER:
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
CHRISTOPHER:
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew,

If by the way they be not fought withal.
DERBY:
Return unto thy lord, commend me to him
DERBY:
Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
DERBY:
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
BUCKINGHAM:
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
BUCKINGHAM:
Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
BUCKINGHAM:
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
BUCKINGHAM:
If that your moody discontented souls
BUCKINGHAM:
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
BUCKINGHAM:
Even for revenge mock my destruction!
BUCKINGHAM:
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?
Sheriff:
It is, my lord.
BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
BUCKINGHAM:
This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
BUCKINGHAM:
I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
BUCKINGHAM:
False to his children or his wife's allies
BUCKINGHAM:
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
BUCKINGHAM:
By the false faith of him I trusted most,
BUCKINGHAM:
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
BUCKINGHAM:
Is the determined respite of my wrongs
BUCKINGHAM:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
BUCKINGHAM:
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
BUCKINGHAM:
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
BUCKINGHAM:
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
BUCKINGHAM:
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms
BUCKINGHAM:
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head,
BUCKINGHAM:
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,

Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,

Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
RICHMOND:
Thus far into the bowels of the land
RICHMOND:
Have we march'd on without impediment,
RICHMOND:
And here receive we from our father Stanley
RICHMOND:
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
RICHMOND:
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
RICHMOND:
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
RICHMOND:
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
RICHMOND:
In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
RICHMOND:
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
RICHMOND:
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
RICHMOND:
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
RICHMOND:
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
RICHMOND:
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
RICHMOND:
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
OXFORD:
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
OXFORD:
To fight against that bloody homicide.
HERBERT:
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
BLUNT:
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
BLUNT:
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
RICHMOND:
All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march
RICHMOND:
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings

Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
KING RICHARD III:
My Lord of Norfolk,--
NORFOLK:
Here, most gracious liege.
KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, we must have knocks, ha! must we not?
NORFOLK:
We must both give and take, my gracious lord.
KING RICHARD III:
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight,
KING RICHARD III:
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
KING RICHARD III:
Who hath descried the number of the foe?
NORFOLK:
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
KING RICHARD III:
Why, our battalion trebles that account
KING RICHARD III:
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
KING RICHARD III:
Which they upon the adverse party want.
KING RICHARD III:
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
KING RICHARD III:
Let us survey the vantage of the field
KING RICHARD III:
Call for some men of sound direction
KING RICHARD III:
Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
KING RICHARD III:
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
KING RICHARD III:
Exeunt

Enter, on the other side of the field, RICHMOND,  Sir William Brandon, OXFORD, and others. Some of the Soldiers pitch RICHMOND's tent
RICHMOND:
The weary sun hath made a golden set,
RICHMOND:
And by the bright track of his fiery car,
RICHMOND:
Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
RICHMOND:
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
RICHMOND:
Give me some ink and paper in my tent
RICHMOND:
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
RICHMOND:
Limit each leader to his several charge,
RICHMOND:
And part in just proportion our small strength.
RICHMOND:
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
RICHMOND:
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
RICHMOND:
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment
RICHMOND:
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
RICHMOND:
And by the second hour in the morning
RICHMOND:
Desire the earl to see me in my tent
RICHMOND:
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
RICHMOND:
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?
BLUNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
BLUNT:
Which well I am assured I have not done,
BLUNT:
His regiment lies half a mile at least
BLUNT:
South from the mighty power of the king.
RICHMOND:
If without peril it be possible,
RICHMOND:
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
RICHMOND:
And give him from me this most needful scroll.
BLUNT:
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it,
BLUNT:
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
RICHMOND:
Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
RICHMOND:
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
RICHMOND:
In to our tent, the air is raw and cold.
RICHMOND:
They withdraw into the tent
RICHMOND:
Enter, to his tent, KING RICHARD III, NORFOLK, RATCLIFF, CATESBY, and others
KING RICHARD III:
What is't o'clock?
CATESBY:
It's supper-time, my lord,
CATESBY:
It's nine o'clock.
KING RICHARD III:
I will not sup to-night.
KING RICHARD III:
Give me some ink and paper.
KING RICHARD III:
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
KING RICHARD III:
And all my armour laid into my tent?
CATESBY:
If is, my liege, and all things are in readiness.
KING RICHARD III:
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge,
KING RICHARD III:
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
NORFOLK:
I go, my lord.
KING RICHARD III:
Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
NORFOLK:
I warrant you, my lord.
NORFOLK:
Exit
KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!
CATESBY:
My lord?
KING RICHARD III:
Send out a pursuivant at arms
KING RICHARD III:
To Stanley's regiment, bid him bring his power
KING RICHARD III:
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
KING RICHARD III:
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
KING RICHARD III:
Exit CATESBY
KING RICHARD III:
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
KING RICHARD III:
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
KING RICHARD III:
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
KING RICHARD III:
Ratcliff!
RATCLIFF:
My lord?
KING RICHARD III:
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
RATCLIFF:
Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
RATCLIFF:
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
RATCLIFF:
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
KING RICHARD III:
So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine
KING RICHARD III:
I have not that alacrity of spirit,
KING RICHARD III:
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
KING RICHARD III:
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
RATCLIFF:
It is, my lord.
KING RICHARD III:
Bid my guard watch, leave me.
KING RICHARD III:
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
KING RICHARD III:
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
KING RICHARD III:
Exeunt RATCLIFF and the other Attendants
KING RICHARD III:
Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent, Lords and others attending
DERBY:
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
RICHMOND:
All comfort that the dark night can afford
RICHMOND:
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
RICHMOND:
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
DERBY:
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
DERBY:
Who prays continually for Richmond's good
DERBY:
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
DERBY:
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
DERBY:
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
DERBY:
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
DERBY:
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
DERBY:
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
DERBY:
I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
DERBY:
With best advantage will deceive the time,
DERBY:
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms
DERBY:
But on thy side I may not be too forward
DERBY:
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
DERBY:
Be executed in his father's sight.
DERBY:
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
DERBY:
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
DERBY:
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
DERBY:
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon
DERBY:
God give us leisure for these rites of love!
DERBY:
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
RICHMOND:
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment
RICHMOND:
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
RICHMOND:
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
RICHMOND:
When I should mount with wings of victory
RICHMOND:
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
RICHMOND:
Exeunt all but RICHMOND
RICHMOND:
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
RICHMOND:
Look on my forces with a gracious eye,
RICHMOND:
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
RICHMOND:
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
RICHMOND:
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
RICHMOND:
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
RICHMOND:
That we may praise thee in the victory!
RICHMOND:
To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
RICHMOND:
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes
RICHMOND:
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
RICHMOND:
Sleeps

KING RICHARD III:
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
KING RICHARD III:
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
KING RICHARD III:
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
KING RICHARD III:
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
KING RICHARD III:
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
KING RICHARD III:
What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by
KING RICHARD III:
Richard loves Richard, that is, I am I.
KING RICHARD III:
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am
KING RICHARD III:
Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why
KING RICHARD III:
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
KING RICHARD III:
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
KING RICHARD III:
That I myself have done unto myself?
KING RICHARD III:
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
KING RICHARD III:
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
KING RICHARD III:
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
KING RICHARD III:
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
KING RICHARD III:
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
KING RICHARD III:
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
KING RICHARD III:
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
KING RICHARD III:
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
KING RICHARD III:
Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree,
KING RICHARD III:
All several sins, all used in each degree,
KING RICHARD III:
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
KING RICHARD III:
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me,
KING RICHARD III:
And if I die, no soul shall pity me
KING RICHARD III:
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
KING RICHARD III:
Find in myself no pity to myself?
KING RICHARD III:
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
KING RICHARD III:
Came to my tent, and every one did threat
KING RICHARD III:
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
KING RICHARD III:
Enter RATCLIFF
RATCLIFF:
My lord!
KING RICHARD III:
'Zounds! who is there?
RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, my lord, 'tis I. The early village-cock
RATCLIFF:
Hath twice done salutation to the morn,
RATCLIFF:
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
KING RICHARD III:
What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?
RATCLIFF:
No doubt, my lord.
KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--
RATCLIFF:
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
KING RICHARD III:
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
KING RICHARD III:
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
KING RICHARD III:
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
KING RICHARD III:
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
KING RICHARD III:
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me,
KING RICHARD III:
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
KING RICHARD III:
To see if any mean to shrink from me.
KING RICHARD III:
Exeunt
KING RICHARD III:
Enter the Lords to RICHMOND, sitting in his tent
LORDS:
Good morrow, Richmond!
RICHMOND:
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
RICHMOND:
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
LORDS:
How have you slept, my lord?
RICHMOND:
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
RICHMOND:
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
RICHMOND:
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
RICHMOND:
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
RICHMOND:
Came to my tent, and cried on victory
RICHMOND:
I promise you, my soul is very jocund
RICHMOND:
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
RICHMOND:
How far into the morning is it, lords?
LORDS:
Upon the stroke of four.
RICHMOND:
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
RICHMOND:
His oration to his soldiers
RICHMOND:
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
RICHMOND:
The leisure and enforcement of the time
RICHMOND:
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
RICHMOND:
God and our good cause fight upon our side,
RICHMOND:
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
RICHMOND:
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces,
RICHMOND:
Richard except, those whom we fight against
RICHMOND:
Had rather have us win than him they follow
RICHMOND:
For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
RICHMOND:
A bloody tyrant and a homicide,
RICHMOND:
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd,
RICHMOND:
One that made means to come by what he hath,
RICHMOND:
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him,
RICHMOND:
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
RICHMOND:
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set,
RICHMOND:
One that hath ever been God's enemy
RICHMOND:
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
RICHMOND:
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers,
RICHMOND:
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
RICHMOND:
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain,
RICHMOND:
If you do fight against your country's foes,
RICHMOND:
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire,
RICHMOND:
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
RICHMOND:
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors,
RICHMOND:
If you do free your children from the sword,
RICHMOND:
Your children's children quit it in your age.
RICHMOND:
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
RICHMOND:
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
RICHMOND:
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
RICHMOND:
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face,
RICHMOND:
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
RICHMOND:
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
RICHMOND:
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully,
RICHMOND:
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!
RICHMOND:
Exeunt
RICHMOND:
Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, Attendants and Forces
KING RICHARD III:
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
RATCLIFF:
That he was never trained up in arms.
KING RICHARD III:
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
RATCLIFF:
He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'
KING RICHARD III:
He was in the right, and so indeed it is.
KING RICHARD III:
Clock striketh
KING RICHARD III:
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
KING RICHARD III:
Who saw the sun to-day?
RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord.
KING RICHARD III:
Then he disdains to shine, for by the book
KING RICHARD III:
He should have braved the east an hour ago
KING RICHARD III:
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
RATCLIFF:
My lord?
KING RICHARD III:
The sun will not be seen to-day,
KING RICHARD III:
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
KING RICHARD III:
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
KING RICHARD III:
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
KING RICHARD III:
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
KING RICHARD III:
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
KING RICHARD III:
Enter NORFOLK
NORFOLK:
Arm, arm, my lord, the foe vaunts in the field.
KING RICHARD III:
Come, bustle, bustle, caparison my horse.
KING RICHARD III:
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power
KING RICHARD III:
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
KING RICHARD III:
And thus my battle shall be ordered
KING RICHARD III:
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
KING RICHARD III:
Consisting equally of horse and foot,
KING RICHARD III:
Our archers shall be placed in the midst
KING RICHARD III:
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
KING RICHARD III:
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
KING RICHARD III:
They thus directed, we will follow
KING RICHARD III:
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
KING RICHARD III:
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
KING RICHARD III:
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
NORFOLK:
A good direction, warlike sovereign.
NORFOLK:
This found I on my tent this morning.
NORFOLK:
He sheweth him a paper
KING RICHARD III:
[Reads]
KING RICHARD III:
'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,
KING RICHARD III:
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
KING RICHARD III:
A thing devised by the enemy.
KING RICHARD III:
Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge
KING RICHARD III:
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls
KING RICHARD III:
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
KING RICHARD III:
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe
KING RICHARD III:
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
KING RICHARD III:
March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell
KING RICHARD III:
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
KING RICHARD III:
His oration to his Army
KING RICHARD III:
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
KING RICHARD III:
Remember whom you are to cope withal,
KING RICHARD III:
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
KING RICHARD III:
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
KING RICHARD III:
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
KING RICHARD III:
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
KING RICHARD III:
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest,
KING RICHARD III:
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
KING RICHARD III:
They would restrain the one, distain the other.
KING RICHARD III:
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
KING RICHARD III:
Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?
KING RICHARD III:
A milk-sop, one that never in his life
KING RICHARD III:
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
KING RICHARD III:
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again,
KING RICHARD III:
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
KING RICHARD III:
These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives,
KING RICHARD III:
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
KING RICHARD III:
For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves
KING RICHARD III:
If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
KING RICHARD III:
And not these bastard Bretons, whom our fathers
KING RICHARD III:
Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
KING RICHARD III:
And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
KING RICHARD III:
Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?
KING RICHARD III:
Ravish our daughters?
KING RICHARD III:
Drum afar off
KING RICHARD III:
Hark! I hear their drum.
KING RICHARD III:
Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!
KING RICHARD III:
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
KING RICHARD III:
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood,
KING RICHARD III:
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
KING RICHARD III:
Enter a Messenger
KING RICHARD III:
What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?
Messenger:
My lord, he doth deny to come.
KING RICHARD III:
Off with his son George's head!
NORFOLK:
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
NORFOLK:
After the battle let George Stanley die.
KING RICHARD III:
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom
KING RICHARD III:
Advance our standards, set upon our foes
KING RICHARD III:
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
KING RICHARD III:
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
KING RICHARD III:
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.
KING RICHARD III:
Exeunt
KING RICHARD III:
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
KING RICHARD III:
Alarum: excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces fighting, to him CATESBY
CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
CATESBY:
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
CATESBY:
Daring an opposite to every danger
CATESBY:
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
CATESBY:
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
CATESBY:
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
CATESBY:
Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD III
KING RICHARD III:
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord, I'll help you to a horse.
KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
KING RICHARD III:
And I will stand the hazard of the die
KING RICHARD III:
I think there be six Richmonds in the field,
KING RICHARD III:
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
KING RICHARD III:
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
KING RICHARD III:
Exeunt
KING RICHARD III:
SCENE V. Another part of the field.
KING RICHARD III:
Alarum. Enter KING RICHARD III and RICHMOND, they  fight. KING RICHARD III is slain. Retreat and  flourish. Re-enter RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the crown, with divers other Lords
RICHMOND:
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
RICHMOND:
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
DERBY:
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
DERBY:
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
DERBY:
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
DERBY:
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal
DERBY:
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
RICHMOND:
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
RICHMOND:
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?
DERBY:
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,
DERBY:
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
RICHMOND:
What men of name are slain on either side?
DERBY:
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
DERBY:
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
RICHMOND:
Inter their bodies as becomes their births
RICHMOND:
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
RICHMOND:
That in submission will return to us
RICHMOND:
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
RICHMOND:
We will unite the white rose and the red
RICHMOND:
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
RICHMOND:
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
RICHMOND:
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
RICHMOND:
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself,
RICHMOND:
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
RICHMOND:
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
RICHMOND:
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire
RICHMOND:
All this divided York and Lancaster,
RICHMOND:
Divided in their dire division,
RICHMOND:
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
RICHMOND:
The true succeeders of each royal house,
RICHMOND:
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
RICHMOND:
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
RICHMOND:
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
RICHMOND:
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
RICHMOND:
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
RICHMOND:
That would reduce these bloody days again,
RICHMOND:
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
RICHMOND:
Let them not live to taste this land's increase
RICHMOND:
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
RICHMOND:
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again
RICHMOND:
That she may long live here, God say amen!
RICHMOND:
Exeunt
