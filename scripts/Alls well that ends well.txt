KING EDWARD IV:
ACT I
KING EDWARD IV:
SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
KING EDWARD IV:
Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black
COUNTESS:
In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
BERTRAM:
And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
BERTRAM:
anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
BERTRAM:
whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
LAFEU:
You shall find of the king a husband, madam, you,
LAFEU:
sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
LAFEU:
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose
LAFEU:
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
LAFEU:
than lack it where there is such abundance.
COUNTESS:
What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
LAFEU:
He hath abandoned his physicians, madam, under whose
LAFEU:
practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
LAFEU:
finds no other advantage in the process but only the
LAFEU:
losing of hope by time.
COUNTESS:
This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
COUNTESS:
'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
COUNTESS:
almost as great as his honesty, had it stretched so
COUNTESS:
far, would have made nature immortal, and death
COUNTESS:
should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
COUNTESS:
king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
COUNTESS:
the death of the king's disease.
LAFEU:
How called you the man you speak of, madam?
COUNTESS:
He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
COUNTESS:
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
LAFEU:
He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
LAFEU:
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
LAFEU:
was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
LAFEU:
could be set up against mortality.
BERTRAM:
What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
LAFEU:
A fistula, my lord.
BERTRAM:
I heard not of it before.
LAFEU:
I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
LAFEU:
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
COUNTESS:
His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
COUNTESS:
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
COUNTESS:
her education promises, her dispositions she
COUNTESS:
inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer, for where
COUNTESS:
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
COUNTESS:
commendations go with pity, they are virtues and
COUNTESS:
traitors too, in her they are the better for their
COUNTESS:
simpleness, she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
LAFEU:
Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
COUNTESS:
'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
COUNTESS:
in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
COUNTESS:
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
COUNTESS:
livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena,
COUNTESS:
go to, no more, lest it be rather thought you affect
COUNTESS:
a sorrow than have it.
HELENA:
I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
LAFEU:
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
LAFEU:
excessive grief the enemy to the living.
COUNTESS:
If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
COUNTESS:
makes it soon mortal.
BERTRAM:
Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
LAFEU:
How understand we that?
COUNTESS:
Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
COUNTESS:
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
COUNTESS:
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
COUNTESS:
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
COUNTESS:
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
COUNTESS:
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
COUNTESS:
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
COUNTESS:
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
COUNTESS:
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
COUNTESS:
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord,
COUNTESS:
'Tis an unseason'd courtier, good my lord,
COUNTESS:
Advise him.
LAFEU:
He cannot want the best
LAFEU:
That shall attend his love.
COUNTESS:
Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
COUNTESS:
Exit
BERTRAM:
[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in
BERTRAM:
your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
BERTRAM:
to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
LAFEU:
Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
LAFEU:
your father.
LAFEU:
Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
HELENA:
O, were that all! I think not on my father,
HELENA:
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
HELENA:
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
HELENA:
I have forgot him: my imagination
HELENA:
Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
HELENA:
I am undone: there is no living, none,
HELENA:
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
HELENA:
That I should love a bright particular star
HELENA:
And think to wed it, he is so above me
HELENA:
In his bright radiance and collateral light
HELENA:
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
HELENA:
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself
HELENA:
The hind that would be mated by the lion
HELENA:
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
HELENA:
To see him every hour, to sit and draw
HELENA:
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
HELENA:
In our heart's table, heart too capable
HELENA:
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour
HELENA:
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
HELENA:
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
HELENA:
Enter PAROLLES
HELENA:
Aside
HELENA:
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake,
HELENA:
And yet I know him a notorious liar,
HELENA:
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward,
HELENA:
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
HELENA:
That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
HELENA:
Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
HELENA:
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
PAROLLES:
Save you, fair queen!
HELENA:
And you, monarch!
PAROLLES:
No.
HELENA:
And no.
PAROLLES:
Are you meditating on virginity?
HELENA:
Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
HELENA:
ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity, how
HELENA:
may we barricado it against him?
PAROLLES:
Keep him out.
HELENA:
But he assails, and our virginity, though valiant,
HELENA:
in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
HELENA:
warlike resistance.
PAROLLES:
There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
PAROLLES:
undermine you and blow you up.
HELENA:
Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
HELENA:
blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
HELENA:
virgins might blow up men?
PAROLLES:
Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
PAROLLES:
blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
PAROLLES:
the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
PAROLLES:
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
PAROLLES:
preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
PAROLLES:
increase and there was never virgin got till
PAROLLES:
virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
PAROLLES:
metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
PAROLLES:
may be ten times found, by being ever kept, it is
PAROLLES:
ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion, away with 't!
HELENA:
I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
PAROLLES:
There's little can be said in 't, 'tis against the
PAROLLES:
rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
PAROLLES:
is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible
PAROLLES:
disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin
PAROLLES:
virginity murders itself and should be buried in
PAROLLES:
highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
PAROLLES:
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
PAROLLES:
much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very
PAROLLES:
paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
PAROLLES:
Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
PAROLLES:
self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
PAROLLES:
canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but loose
PAROLLES:
by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
PAROLLES:
itself ten, which is a goodly increase, and the
PAROLLES:
principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
HELENA:
How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
PAROLLES:
Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
PAROLLES:
likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
PAROLLES:
lying, the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
PAROLLES:
while 'tis vendible, answer the time of request.
PAROLLES:
Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
PAROLLES:
of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
PAROLLES:
like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
PAROLLES:
now. Your date is better in your pie and your
PAROLLES:
porridge than in your cheek, and your virginity,
PAROLLES:
your old virginity, is like one of our French
PAROLLES:
withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily, marry,
PAROLLES:
'tis a withered pear, it was formerly better,
PAROLLES:
marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
HELENA:
Not my virginity yet [         ]
HELENA:
There shall your master have a thousand loves,
HELENA:
A mother and a mistress and a friend,
HELENA:
A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
HELENA:
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
HELENA:
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear,
HELENA:
His humble ambition, proud humility,
HELENA:
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
HELENA:
His faith, his sweet disaster, with a world
HELENA:
Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
HELENA:
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
HELENA:
I know not what he shall. God send him well!
HELENA:
The court's a learning place, and he is one--
PAROLLES:
What one, i' faith?
HELENA:
That I wish well. 'Tis pity--
PAROLLES:
What's pity?
HELENA:
That wishing well had not a body in't,
HELENA:
Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born,
HELENA:
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
HELENA:
Might with effects of them follow our friends,
HELENA:
And show what we alone must think, which never
HELENA:
Return us thanks.
HELENA:
Enter Page
Page:
Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
Page:
Exit
PAROLLES:
Little Helen, farewell, if I can remember thee, I
PAROLLES:
will think of thee at court.
HELENA:
Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
PAROLLES:
Under Mars, I.
HELENA:
I especially think, under Mars.
PAROLLES:
Why under Mars?
HELENA:
The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
HELENA:
be born under Mars.
PAROLLES:
When he was predominant.
HELENA:
When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
PAROLLES:
Why think you so?
HELENA:
You go so much backward when you fight.
PAROLLES:
That's for advantage.
HELENA:
So is running away, when fear proposes the safety,
HELENA:
but the composition that your valour and fear makes
HELENA:
in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
PAROLLES:
I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
PAROLLES:
acutely. I will return perfect courtier, in the
PAROLLES:
which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
PAROLLES:
thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
PAROLLES:
counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
PAROLLES:
thee, else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
PAROLLES:
thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
PAROLLES:
thou hast leisure, say thy prayers, when thou hast
PAROLLES:
none, remember thy friends, get thee a good husband,
PAROLLES:
and use him as he uses thee, so, farewell.
PAROLLES:
Exit
HELENA:
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
HELENA:
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
HELENA:
Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
HELENA:
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
HELENA:
What power is it which mounts my love so high,
HELENA:
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
HELENA:
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
HELENA:
To join like likes and kiss like native things.
HELENA:
Impossible be strange attempts to those
HELENA:
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
HELENA:
What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
HELENA:
So show her merit, that did miss her love?
HELENA:
The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
HELENA:
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.
HELENA:
Exit
HELENA:
SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.
HELENA:
Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants
KING:
The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears,
KING:
Have fought with equal fortune and continue
KING:
A braving war.
First Lord:
So 'tis reported, sir.
KING:
Nay, 'tis most credible, we here received it
KING:
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
KING:
With caution that the Florentine will move us
KING:
For speedy aid, wherein our dearest friend
KING:
Prejudicates the business and would seem
KING:
To have us make denial.
First Lord:
His love and wisdom,
First Lord:
Approved so to your majesty, may plead
First Lord:
For amplest credence.
KING:
He hath arm'd our answer,
KING:
And Florence is denied before he comes
KING:
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
KING:
The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
KING:
To stand on either part.
Second Lord:
It well may serve
Second Lord:
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
Second Lord:
For breathing and exploit.
KING:
What's he comes here?
KING:
Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
First Lord:
It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
First Lord:
Young Bertram.
KING:
Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face,
KING:
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
KING:
Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
KING:
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
BERTRAM:
My thanks and duty are your majesty's.
KING:
I would I had that corporal soundness now,
KING:
As when thy father and myself in friendship
KING:
First tried our soldiership! He did look far
KING:
Into the service of the time and was
KING:
Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long,
KING:
But on us both did haggish age steal on
KING:
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
KING:
To talk of your good father. In his youth
KING:
He had the wit which I can well observe
KING:
To-day in our young lords, but they may jest
KING:
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
KING:
Ere they can hide their levity in honour,
KING:
So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
KING:
Were in his pride or sharpness, if they were,
KING:
His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
KING:
Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
KING:
Exception bid him speak, and at this time
KING:
His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
KING:
He used as creatures of another place
KING:
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
KING:
Making them proud of his humility,
KING:
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
KING:
Might be a copy to these younger times,
KING:
Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
KING:
But goers backward.
BERTRAM:
His good remembrance, sir,
BERTRAM:
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb,
BERTRAM:
So in approof lives not his epitaph
BERTRAM:
As in your royal speech.
KING:
Would I were with him! He would always say--
KING:
Methinks I hear him now, his plausive words
KING:
He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
KING:
To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
KING:
This his good melancholy oft began,
KING:
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
KING:
When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
KING:
'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
KING:
Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
KING:
All but new things disdain, whose judgments are
KING:
Mere fathers of their garments, whose constancies
KING:
Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd,
KING:
I after him do after him wish too,
KING:
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
KING:
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
KING:
To give some labourers room.
Second Lord:
You are loved, sir
Second Lord:
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
KING:
I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
KING:
Since the physician at your father's died?
KING:
He was much famed.
BERTRAM:
Some six months since, my lord.
KING:
If he were living, I would try him yet.
KING:
Lend me an arm, the rest have worn me out
KING:
With several applications, nature and sickness
KING:
Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count,
KING:
My son's no dearer.
BERTRAM:
Thank your majesty.
BERTRAM:
Exeunt. Flourish
BERTRAM:
SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
BERTRAM:
Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown
COUNTESS:
I will now hear, what say you of this gentlewoman?
Steward:
Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I
Steward:
wish might be found in the calendar of my past
Steward:
endeavours, for then we wound our modesty and make
Steward:
foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
Steward:
ourselves we publish them.
COUNTESS:
What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah
COUNTESS:
the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
COUNTESS:
believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not, for I know
COUNTESS:
you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
COUNTESS:
enough to make such knaveries yours.
Clown:
'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
COUNTESS:
Well, sir.
Clown:
No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though
Clown:
many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have
Clown:
your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel
Clown:
the woman and I will do as we may.
COUNTESS:
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
Clown:
I do beg your good will in this case.
COUNTESS:
In what case?
Clown:
In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
Clown:
heritage: and I think I shall never have the
Clown:
blessing of God till I have issue o' my body, for
Clown:
they say barnes are blessings.
COUNTESS:
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
Clown:
My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
Clown:
by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil drives.
COUNTESS:
Is this all your worship's reason?
Clown:
Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
Clown:
are.
COUNTESS:
May the world know them?
Clown:
I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
Clown:
all flesh and blood are, and, indeed, I do marry
Clown:
that I may repent.
COUNTESS:
Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
Clown:
I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have
Clown:
friends for my wife's sake.
COUNTESS:
Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
Clown:
You're shallow, madam, in great friends, for the
Clown:
knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
Clown:
He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
Clown:
leave to in the crop, if I be his cuckold, he's my
Clown:
drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
Clown:
of my flesh and blood, he that cherishes my flesh
Clown:
and blood loves my flesh and blood, he that loves my
Clown:
flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
Clown:
my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
Clown:
be what they are, there were no fear in marriage,
Clown:
for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
Clown:
Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in
Clown:
religion, their heads are both one, they may jowl
Clown:
horns together, like any deer i' the herd.
COUNTESS:
Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?
Clown:
A prophet I, madam, and I speak the truth the next
Clown:
way
Clown:
For I the ballad will repeat,
Clown:
Which men full true shall find,
Clown:
Your marriage comes by destiny,
Clown:
Your cuckoo sings by kind.
COUNTESS:
Get you gone, sir, I'll talk with you more anon.
Steward:
May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to
Steward:
you: of her I am to speak.
COUNTESS:
Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her,
COUNTESS:
Helen, I mean.
Clown:
Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
Clown:
Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
Clown:
Fond done, done fond,
Clown:
Was this King Priam's joy?
Clown:
With that she sighed as she stood,
Clown:
With that she sighed as she stood,
Clown:
And gave this sentence then,
Clown:
Among nine bad if one be good,
Clown:
Among nine bad if one be good,
Clown:
There's yet one good in ten.
COUNTESS:
What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.
Clown:
One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying
Clown:
o' the song: would God would serve the world so all
Clown:
the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
Clown:
if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we
Clown:
might have a good woman born but one every blazing
Clown:
star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery
Clown:
well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck
Clown:
one.
COUNTESS:
You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
Clown:
That man should be at woman's command, and yet no
Clown:
hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it
Clown:
will do no hurt, it will wear the surplice of
Clown:
humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
Clown:
going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.
Clown:
Exit
COUNTESS:
Well, now.
Steward:
I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
COUNTESS:
Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me, and
COUNTESS:
she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully
COUNTESS:
make title to as much love as she finds: there is
COUNTESS:
more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid
COUNTESS:
her than she'll demand.
Steward:
Madam, I was very late more near her than I think
Steward:
she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate
Steward:
to herself her own words to her own ears, she
Steward:
thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
Steward:
stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son
Steward:
Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put
Steward:
such difference betwixt their two estates, Love no
Steward:
god, that would not extend his might, only where
Steward:
qualities were level, Dian no queen of virgins, that
Steward:
would suffer her poor knight surprised, without
Steward:
rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
Steward:
This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
Steward:
sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I
Steward:
held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal,
Steward:
sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns
Steward:
you something to know it.
COUNTESS:
You have discharged this honestly, keep it to
COUNTESS:
yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this
COUNTESS:
before, which hung so tottering in the balance that
COUNTESS:
I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
COUNTESS:
leave me: stall this in your bosom, and I thank you
COUNTESS:
for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.
COUNTESS:
Exit Steward
COUNTESS:
Enter HELENA
COUNTESS:
Even so it was with me when I was young
COUNTESS:
If ever we are nature's, these are ours, this thorn
COUNTESS:
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong,
COUNTESS:
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born,
COUNTESS:
It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
COUNTESS:
Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth
COUNTESS:
By our remembrances of days foregone,
COUNTESS:
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
COUNTESS:
Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.
HELENA:
What is your pleasure, madam?
COUNTESS:
You know, Helen,
COUNTESS:
I am a mother to you.
HELENA:
Mine honourable mistress.
COUNTESS:
Nay, a mother
COUNTESS:
Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
COUNTESS:
Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'
COUNTESS:
That you start at it? I say, I am your mother,
COUNTESS:
And put you in the catalogue of those
COUNTESS:
That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
COUNTESS:
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
COUNTESS:
A native slip to us from foreign seeds
COUNTESS:
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
COUNTESS:
Yet I express to you a mother's care
COUNTESS:
God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
COUNTESS:
To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
COUNTESS:
That this distemper'd messenger of wet,
COUNTESS:
The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
COUNTESS:
Why? that you are my daughter?
HELENA:
That I am not.
COUNTESS:
I say, I am your mother.
HELENA:
Pardon, madam,
HELENA:
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother
HELENA:
I am from humble, he from honour'd name,
HELENA:
No note upon my parents, his all noble
HELENA:
My master, my dear lord he is, and I
HELENA:
His servant live, and will his vassal die
HELENA:
He must not be my brother.
COUNTESS:
Nor I your mother?
HELENA:
You are my mother, madam, would you were,--
HELENA:
So that my lord your son were not my brother,--
HELENA:
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
HELENA:
I care no more for than I do for heaven,
HELENA:
So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
HELENA:
But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
COUNTESS:
Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law
COUNTESS:
God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
COUNTESS:
So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
COUNTESS:
My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
COUNTESS:
The mystery of your loneliness, and find
COUNTESS:
Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
COUNTESS:
You love my son, invention is ashamed,
COUNTESS:
Against the proclamation of thy passion,
COUNTESS:
To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true,
COUNTESS:
But tell me then, 'tis so, for, look thy cheeks
COUNTESS:
Confess it, th' one to th' other, and thine eyes
COUNTESS:
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
COUNTESS:
That in their kind they speak it: only sin
COUNTESS:
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
COUNTESS:
That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
COUNTESS:
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew,
COUNTESS:
If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
COUNTESS:
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
COUNTESS:
Tell me truly.
HELENA:
Good madam, pardon me!
COUNTESS:
Do you love my son?
HELENA:
Your pardon, noble mistress!
COUNTESS:
Love you my son?
HELENA:
Do not you love him, madam?
COUNTESS:
Go not about, my love hath in't a bond,
COUNTESS:
Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
COUNTESS:
The state of your affection, for your passions
COUNTESS:
Have to the full appeach'd.
HELENA:
Then, I confess,
HELENA:
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
HELENA:
That before you, and next unto high heaven,
HELENA:
I love your son.
HELENA:
My friends were poor, but honest, so's my love
HELENA:
Be not offended, for it hurts not him
HELENA:
That he is loved of me: I follow him not
HELENA:
By any token of presumptuous suit,
HELENA:
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him,
HELENA:
Yet never know how that desert should be.
HELENA:
I know I love in vain, strive against hope,
HELENA:
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
HELENA:
I still pour in the waters of my love
HELENA:
And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,
HELENA:
Religious in mine error, I adore
HELENA:
The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
HELENA:
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
HELENA:
Let not your hate encounter with my love
HELENA:
For loving where you do: but if yourself,
HELENA:
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
HELENA:
Did ever in so true a flame of liking
HELENA:
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
HELENA:
Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
HELENA:
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
HELENA:
But lend and give where she is sure to lose,
HELENA:
That seeks not to find that her search implies,
HELENA:
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!
COUNTESS:
Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--
COUNTESS:
To go to Paris?
HELENA:
Madam, I had.
COUNTESS:
Wherefore? tell true.
HELENA:
I will tell truth, by grace itself I swear.
HELENA:
You know my father left me some prescriptions
HELENA:
Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
HELENA:
And manifest experience had collected
HELENA:
For general sovereignty, and that he will'd me
HELENA:
In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
HELENA:
As notes whose faculties inclusive were
HELENA:
More than they were in note: amongst the rest,
HELENA:
There is a remedy, approved, set down,
HELENA:
To cure the desperate languishings whereof
HELENA:
The king is render'd lost.
COUNTESS:
This was your motive
COUNTESS:
For Paris, was it? speak.
HELENA:
My lord your son made me to think of this,
HELENA:
Else Paris and the medicine and the king
HELENA:
Had from the conversation of my thoughts
HELENA:
Haply been absent then.
COUNTESS:
But think you, Helen,
COUNTESS:
If you should tender your supposed aid,
COUNTESS:
He would receive it? he and his physicians
COUNTESS:
Are of a mind, he, that they cannot help him,
COUNTESS:
They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
COUNTESS:
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
COUNTESS:
Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
COUNTESS:
The danger to itself?
HELENA:
There's something in't,
HELENA:
More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
HELENA:
Of his profession, that his good receipt
HELENA:
Shall for my legacy be sanctified
HELENA:
By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
HELENA:
But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
HELENA:
The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
HELENA:
By such a day and hour.
COUNTESS:
Dost thou believe't?
HELENA:
Ay, madam, knowingly.
COUNTESS:
Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
COUNTESS:
Means and attendants and my loving greetings
COUNTESS:
To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
COUNTESS:
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt
COUNTESS:
Be gone to-morrow, and be sure of this,
COUNTESS:
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.
COUNTESS:
Exeunt
COUNTESS:
ACT II
COUNTESS:
SCENE I. Paris. The KING's palace.
COUNTESS:
Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended  with divers young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war, BERTRAM, and PAROLLES
KING:
Farewell, young lords, these warlike principles
KING:
Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell
KING:
Share the advice betwixt you, if both gain, all
KING:
The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
KING:
And is enough for both.
First Lord:
'Tis our hope, sir,
First Lord:
After well enter'd soldiers, to return
First Lord:
And find your grace in health.
KING:
No, no, it cannot be, and yet my heart
KING:
Will not confess he owes the malady
KING:
That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords,
KING:
Whether I live or die, be you the sons
KING:
Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--
KING:
Those bated that inherit but the fall
KING:
Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
KING:
Not to woo honour, but to wed it, when
KING:
The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
KING:
That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.
Second Lord:
Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!
KING:
Those girls of Italy, take heed of them
KING:
They say, our French lack language to deny,
KING:
If they demand: beware of being captives,
KING:
Before you serve.
Both:
Our hearts receive your warnings.
KING:
Farewell. Come hither to me.
KING:
Exit, attended
First Lord:
O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
PAROLLES:
'Tis not his fault, the spark.
Second Lord:
O, 'tis brave wars!
PAROLLES:
Most admirable: I have seen those wars.
BERTRAM:
I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
BERTRAM:
'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'
PAROLLES:
An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.
BERTRAM:
I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
BERTRAM:
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
BERTRAM:
Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
BERTRAM:
But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.
First Lord:
There's honour in the theft.
PAROLLES:
Commit it, count.
Second Lord:
I am your accessary, and so, farewell.
BERTRAM:
I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.
First Lord:
Farewell, captain.
Second Lord:
Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
PAROLLES:
Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good
PAROLLES:
sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall
PAROLLES:
find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain
PAROLLES:
Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here
PAROLLES:
on his sinister cheek, it was this very sword
PAROLLES:
entrenched it: say to him, I live, and observe his
PAROLLES:
reports for me.
First Lord:
We shall, noble captain.
First Lord:
Exeunt Lords
PAROLLES:
Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?
BERTRAM:
Stay: the king.
BERTRAM:
Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire
PAROLLES:
[To BERTRAM]  Use a more spacious ceremony to the
PAROLLES:
noble lords, you have restrained yourself within the
PAROLLES:
list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to
PAROLLES:
them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the
PAROLLES:
time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and
PAROLLES:
move under the influence of the most received star,
PAROLLES:
and though the devil lead the measure, such are to
PAROLLES:
be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.
BERTRAM:
And I will do so.
PAROLLES:
Worthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
PAROLLES:
Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES
PAROLLES:
Enter LAFEU
LAFEU:
[Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
KING:
I'll fee thee to stand up.
LAFEU:
Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
LAFEU:
I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,
LAFEU:
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
KING:
I would I had, so I had broke thy pate,
KING:
And ask'd thee mercy for't.
LAFEU:
Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus,
LAFEU:
Will you be cured of your infirmity?
KING:
No.
LAFEU:
O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
LAFEU:
Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
LAFEU:
My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
LAFEU:
That's able to breathe life into a stone,
LAFEU:
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
LAFEU:
With spritely fire and motion, whose simple touch,
LAFEU:
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
LAFEU:
To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
LAFEU:
And write to her a love-line.
KING:
What 'her' is this?
LAFEU:
Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
LAFEU:
If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
LAFEU:
If seriously I may convey my thoughts
LAFEU:
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
LAFEU:
With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
LAFEU:
Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
LAFEU:
Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
LAFEU:
For that is her demand, and know her business?
LAFEU:
That done, laugh well at me.
KING:
Now, good Lafeu,
KING:
Bring in the admiration, that we with thee
KING:
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
KING:
By wondering how thou took'st it.
LAFEU:
Nay, I'll fit you,
LAFEU:
And not be all day neither.
LAFEU:
Exit
KING:
Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
KING:
Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA
LAFEU:
Nay, come your ways.
KING:
This haste hath wings indeed.
LAFEU:
Nay, come your ways
LAFEU:
This is his majesty, say your mind to him
LAFEU:
A traitor you do look like, but such traitors
LAFEU:
His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,
LAFEU:
That dare leave two together, fare you well.
LAFEU:
Exit
KING:
Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
HELENA:
Ay, my good lord.
HELENA:
Gerard de Narbon was my father,
HELENA:
In what he did profess, well found.
KING:
I knew him.
HELENA:
The rather will I spare my praises towards him
HELENA:
Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
HELENA:
Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
HELENA:
Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
HELENA:
And of his old experience the oily darling,
HELENA:
He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
HELENA:
Safer than mine own two, more dear, I have so,
HELENA:
And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
HELENA:
With that malignant cause wherein the honour
HELENA:
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
HELENA:
I come to tender it and my appliance
HELENA:
With all bound humbleness.
KING:
We thank you, maiden,
KING:
But may not be so credulous of cure,
KING:
When our most learned doctors leave us and
KING:
The congregated college have concluded
KING:
That labouring art can never ransom nature
KING:
From her inaidible estate, I say we must not
KING:
So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
KING:
To prostitute our past-cure malady
KING:
To empirics, or to dissever so
KING:
Our great self and our credit, to esteem
KING:
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
HELENA:
My duty then shall pay me for my pains
HELENA:
I will no more enforce mine office on you.
HELENA:
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
HELENA:
A modest one, to bear me back again.
KING:
I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful
KING:
Thou thought'st to help me, and such thanks I give
KING:
As one near death to those that wish him live
KING:
But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
KING:
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
HELENA:
What I can do can do no hurt to try,
HELENA:
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
HELENA:
He that of greatest works is finisher
HELENA:
Oft does them by the weakest minister
HELENA:
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
HELENA:
When judges have been babes, great floods have flown
HELENA:
From simple sources, and great seas have dried
HELENA:
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
HELENA:
Oft expectation fails and most oft there
HELENA:
Where most it promises, and oft it hits
HELENA:
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.
KING:
I must not hear thee, fare thee well, kind maid,
KING:
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid
KING:
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
HELENA:
Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd
HELENA:
It is not so with Him that all things knows
HELENA:
As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows,
HELENA:
But most it is presumption in us when
HELENA:
The help of heaven we count the act of men.
HELENA:
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent,
HELENA:
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
HELENA:
I am not an impostor that proclaim
HELENA:
Myself against the level of mine aim,
HELENA:
But know I think and think I know most sure
HELENA:
My art is not past power nor you past cure.
KING:
Are thou so confident? within what space
KING:
Hopest thou my cure?
HELENA:
The great'st grace lending grace
HELENA:
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
HELENA:
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
HELENA:
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
HELENA:
Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
HELENA:
Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
HELENA:
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
HELENA:
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
HELENA:
Health shall live free and sickness freely die.
KING:
Upon thy certainty and confidence
KING:
What darest thou venture?
HELENA:
Tax of impudence,
HELENA:
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
HELENA:
Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
HELENA:
Sear'd otherwise, nay, worse--if worse--extended
HELENA:
With vilest torture let my life be ended.
KING:
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
KING:
His powerful sound within an organ weak
KING:
And what impossibility would slay
KING:
In common sense, sense saves another way.
KING:
Thy life is dear, for all that life can rate
KING:
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
KING:
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
KING:
That happiness and prime can happy call
KING:
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
KING:
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
KING:
Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
KING:
That ministers thine own death if I die.
HELENA:
If I break time, or flinch in property
HELENA:
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
HELENA:
And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee,
HELENA:
But, if I help, what do you promise me?
KING:
Make thy demand.
HELENA:
But will you make it even?
KING:
Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
HELENA:
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
HELENA:
What husband in thy power I will command
HELENA:
Exempted be from me the arrogance
HELENA:
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
HELENA:
My low and humble name to propagate
HELENA:
With any branch or image of thy state,
HELENA:
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
HELENA:
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
KING:
Here is my hand, the premises observed,
KING:
Thy will by my performance shall be served
KING:
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
KING:
Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
KING:
More should I question thee, and more I must,
KING:
Though more to know could not be more to trust,
KING:
From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
KING:
Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
KING:
Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
KING:
As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.
KING:
Flourish. Exeunt
KING:
SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
KING:
Enter COUNTESS and Clown
COUNTESS:
Come on, sir, I shall now put you to the height of
COUNTESS:
your breeding.
Clown:
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
Clown:
know my business is but to the court.
COUNTESS:
To the court! why, what place make you special,
COUNTESS:
when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
Clown:
Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
Clown:
may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
Clown:
a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
Clown:
has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap, and indeed
Clown:
such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
Clown:
court, but for me, I have an answer will serve all
Clown:
men.
COUNTESS:
Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
COUNTESS:
questions.
Clown:
It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,
Clown:
the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
Clown:
buttock, or any buttock.
COUNTESS:
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
Clown:
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
Clown:
as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's
Clown:
rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
Clown:
Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
Clown:
hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
Clown:
to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
Clown:
friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.
COUNTESS:
Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
COUNTESS:
questions?
Clown:
From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
Clown:
will fit any question.
COUNTESS:
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
COUNTESS:
must fit all demands.
Clown:
But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
Clown:
should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
Clown:
belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
Clown:
do you no harm to learn.
COUNTESS:
To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
COUNTESS:
question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
COUNTESS:
pray you, sir, are you a courtier?
Clown:
O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,
Clown:
more, a hundred of them.
COUNTESS:
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
Clown:
O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.
COUNTESS:
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
Clown:
O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
COUNTESS:
You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.
Clown:
O Lord, sir! spare not me.
COUNTESS:
Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and
COUNTESS:
'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very
COUNTESS:
sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
COUNTESS:
to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.
Clown:
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,
Clown:
sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.
COUNTESS:
I play the noble housewife with the time
COUNTESS:
To entertain't so merrily with a fool.
Clown:
O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.
COUNTESS:
An end, sir, to your business. Give Helen this,
COUNTESS:
And urge her to a present answer back
COUNTESS:
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son
COUNTESS:
This is not much.
Clown:
Not much commendation to them.
COUNTESS:
Not much employment for you: you understand me?
Clown:
Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.
COUNTESS:
Haste you again.
COUNTESS:
Exeunt severally
COUNTESS:
SCENE III. Paris. The KING's palace.
COUNTESS:
Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
LAFEU:
They say miracles are past, and we have our
LAFEU:
philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,
LAFEU:
things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that
LAFEU:
we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
LAFEU:
into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
LAFEU:
ourselves to an unknown fear.
PAROLLES:
Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
PAROLLES:
shot out in our latter times.
BERTRAM:
And so 'tis.
LAFEU:
To be relinquish'd of the artists,--
PAROLLES:
So I say.
LAFEU:
Both of Galen and Paracelsus.
PAROLLES:
So I say.
LAFEU:
Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--
PAROLLES:
Right, so I say.
LAFEU:
That gave him out incurable,--
PAROLLES:
Why, there 'tis, so say I too.
LAFEU:
Not to be helped,--
PAROLLES:
Right, as 'twere, a man assured of a--
LAFEU:
Uncertain life, and sure death.
PAROLLES:
Just, you say well, so would I have said.
LAFEU:
I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.
PAROLLES:
It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you
PAROLLES:
shall read it in--what do you call there?
LAFEU:
A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.
PAROLLES:
That's it, I would have said the very same.
LAFEU:
Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,
LAFEU:
I speak in respect--
PAROLLES:
Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the
PAROLLES:
brief and the tedious of it, and he's of a most
PAROLLES:
facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--
LAFEU:
Very hand of heaven.
PAROLLES:
Ay, so I say.
LAFEU:
In a most weak--
LAFEU:
pausing
LAFEU:
and debile minister, great power, great
LAFEU:
transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a
LAFEU:
further use to be made than alone the recovery of
LAFEU:
the king, as to be--
LAFEU:
pausing
LAFEU:
generally thankful.
PAROLLES:
I would have said it, you say well. Here comes the king.
PAROLLES:
Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire
LAFEU:
Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the
LAFEU:
better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's
LAFEU:
able to lead her a coranto.
PAROLLES:
Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?
LAFEU:
'Fore God, I think so.
KING:
Go, call before me all the lords in court.
KING:
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side,
KING:
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
KING:
Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
KING:
The confirmation of my promised gift,
KING:
Which but attends thy naming.
KING:
Enter three or four Lords
KING:
Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
KING:
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
KING:
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
KING:
I have to use: thy frank election make,
KING:
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
HELENA:
To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
HELENA:
Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!
LAFEU:
I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
LAFEU:
My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
LAFEU:
And writ as little beard.
KING:
Peruse them well
KING:
Not one of those but had a noble father.
HELENA:
Gentlemen,
HELENA:
Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.
All:
We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
HELENA:
I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
HELENA:
That I protest I simply am a maid.
HELENA:
Please it your majesty, I have done already
HELENA:
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
HELENA:
'We blush that thou shouldst choose, but, be refused,
HELENA:
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,
HELENA:
We'll ne'er come there again.'
KING:
Make choice, and, see,
KING:
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
HELENA:
Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
HELENA:
And to imperial Love, that god most high,
HELENA:
Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
First Lord:
And grant it.
HELENA:
Thanks, sir, all the rest is mute.
LAFEU:
I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
LAFEU:
for my life.
HELENA:
The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
HELENA:
Before I speak, too threateningly replies
HELENA:
Love make your fortunes twenty times above
HELENA:
Her that so wishes and her humble love!
Second Lord:
No better, if you please.
HELENA:
My wish receive,
HELENA:
Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.
LAFEU:
Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
LAFEU:
I'd have them whipped, or I would send them to the
LAFEU:
Turk, to make eunuchs of.
HELENA:
Be not afraid that I your hand should take,
HELENA:
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake
HELENA:
Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
HELENA:
Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
LAFEU:
These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her
LAFEU:
sure, they are bastards to the English, the French
LAFEU:
ne'er got 'em.
HELENA:
You are too young, too happy, and too good,
HELENA:
To make yourself a son out of my blood.
Fourth Lord:
Fair one, I think not so.
LAFEU:
There's one grape yet, I am sure thy father drunk
LAFEU:
wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth
LAFEU:
of fourteen, I have known thee already.
HELENA:
[To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you, but I give
HELENA:
Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
HELENA:
Into your guiding power. This is the man.
KING:
Why, then, young Bertram, take her, she's thy wife.
BERTRAM:
My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
BERTRAM:
In such a business give me leave to use
BERTRAM:
The help of mine own eyes.
KING:
Know'st thou not, Bertram,
KING:
What she has done for me?
BERTRAM:
Yes, my good lord,
BERTRAM:
But never hope to know why I should marry her.
KING:
Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.
BERTRAM:
But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
BERTRAM:
Must answer for your raising? I know her well
BERTRAM:
She had her breeding at my father's charge.
BERTRAM:
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
BERTRAM:
Rather corrupt me ever!
KING:
'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
KING:
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
KING:
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
KING:
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
KING:
In differences so mighty. If she be
KING:
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
KING:
A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
KING:
Of virtue for the name: but do not so
KING:
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
KING:
The place is dignified by the doer's deed
KING:
Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
KING:
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
KING:
Is good without a name. Vileness is so
KING:
The property by what it is should go,
KING:
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair,
KING:
In these to nature she's immediate heir,
KING:
And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
KING:
Which challenges itself as honour's born
KING:
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
KING:
When rather from our acts we them derive
KING:
Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
KING:
Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
KING:
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
KING:
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
KING:
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
KING:
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
KING:
I can create the rest: virtue and she
KING:
Is her own dower, honour and wealth from me.
BERTRAM:
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.
KING:
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
HELENA:
That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad
HELENA:
Let the rest go.
KING:
My honour's at the stake, which to defeat,
KING:
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
KING:
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
KING:
That dost in vile misprision shackle up
KING:
My love and her desert, that canst not dream,
KING:
We, poising us in her defective scale,
KING:
Shall weigh thee to the beam, that wilt not know,
KING:
It is in us to plant thine honour where
KING:
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt
KING:
Obey our will, which travails in thy good
KING:
Believe not thy disdain, but presently
KING:
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
KING:
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims,
KING:
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
KING:
Into the staggers and the careless lapse
KING:
Of youth and ignorance, both my revenge and hate
KING:
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
KING:
Without all terms of pity. Speak, thine answer.
BERTRAM:
Pardon, my gracious lord, for I submit
BERTRAM:
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
BERTRAM:
What great creation and what dole of honour
BERTRAM:
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
BERTRAM:
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
BERTRAM:
The praised of the king, who, so ennobled,
BERTRAM:
Is as 'twere born so.
KING:
Take her by the hand,
KING:
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
KING:
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
KING:
A balance more replete.
BERTRAM:
I take her hand.
KING:
Good fortune and the favour of the king
KING:
Smile upon this contract, whose ceremony
KING:
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
KING:
And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
KING:
Shall more attend upon the coming space,
KING:
Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
KING:
Thy love's to me religious, else, does err.
KING:
Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES
LAFEU:
[Advancing]  Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.
PAROLLES:
Your pleasure, sir?
LAFEU:
Your lord and master did well to make his
LAFEU:
recantation.
PAROLLES:
Recantation! My lord! my master!
LAFEU:
Ay, is it not a language I speak?
PAROLLES:
A most harsh one, and not to be understood without
PAROLLES:
bloody succeeding. My master!
LAFEU:
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
PAROLLES:
To any count, to all counts, to what is man.
LAFEU:
To what is count's man: count's master is of
LAFEU:
another style.
PAROLLES:
You are too old, sir, let it satisfy you, you are too old.
LAFEU:
I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man, to which
LAFEU:
title age cannot bring thee.
PAROLLES:
What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
LAFEU:
I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty
LAFEU:
wise fellow, thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
LAFEU:
travel, it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
LAFEU:
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
LAFEU:
believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I
LAFEU:
have now found thee, when I lose thee again, I care
LAFEU:
not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and
LAFEU:
that thou't scarce worth.
PAROLLES:
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--
LAFEU:
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou
LAFEU:
hasten thy trial, which if--Lord have mercy on thee
LAFEU:
for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee
LAFEU:
well: thy casement I need not open, for I look
LAFEU:
through thee. Give me thy hand.
PAROLLES:
My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
LAFEU:
Ay, with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it.
PAROLLES:
I have not, my lord, deserved it.
LAFEU:
Yes, good faith, every dram of it, and I will not
LAFEU:
bate thee a scruple.
PAROLLES:
Well, I shall be wiser.
LAFEU:
Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at
LAFEU:
a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound
LAFEU:
in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is
LAFEU:
to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold
LAFEU:
my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
LAFEU:
that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.
PAROLLES:
My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
LAFEU:
I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor
LAFEU:
doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by
LAFEU:
thee, in what motion age will give me leave.
LAFEU:
Exit
PAROLLES:
Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off
PAROLLES:
me, scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must
PAROLLES:
be patient, there is no fettering of authority.
PAROLLES:
I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with
PAROLLES:
any convenience, an he were double and double a
PAROLLES:
lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I
PAROLLES:
would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.
PAROLLES:
Re-enter LAFEU
LAFEU:
Sirrah, your lord and master's married, there's news
LAFEU:
for you: you have a new mistress.
PAROLLES:
I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
PAROLLES:
some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good
PAROLLES:
lord: whom I serve above is my master.
LAFEU:
Who? God?
PAROLLES:
Ay, sir.
LAFEU:
The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
LAFEU:
garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of
LAFEU:
sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
LAFEU:
thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
LAFEU:
honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat
LAFEU:
thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
LAFEU:
every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
LAFEU:
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
PAROLLES:
This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
LAFEU:
Go to, sir, you were beaten in Italy for picking a
LAFEU:
kernel out of a pomegranate, you are a vagabond and
LAFEU:
no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
LAFEU:
and honourable personages than the commission of your
LAFEU:
birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not
LAFEU:
worth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.
LAFEU:
Exit
PAROLLES:
Good, very good, it is so then: good, very good,
PAROLLES:
let it be concealed awhile.
PAROLLES:
Re-enter BERTRAM
BERTRAM:
Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
PAROLLES:
What's the matter, sweet-heart?
BERTRAM:
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
BERTRAM:
I will not bed her.
PAROLLES:
What, what, sweet-heart?
BERTRAM:
O my Parolles, they have married me!
BERTRAM:
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
PAROLLES:
France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
PAROLLES:
The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!
BERTRAM:
There's letters from my mother: what the import is,
BERTRAM:
I know not yet.
PAROLLES:
Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
PAROLLES:
He wears his honour in a box unseen,
PAROLLES:
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
PAROLLES:
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
PAROLLES:
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
PAROLLES:
Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
PAROLLES:
France is a stable, we that dwell in't jades,
PAROLLES:
Therefore, to the war!
BERTRAM:
It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
BERTRAM:
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
BERTRAM:
And wherefore I am fled, write to the king
BERTRAM:
That which I durst not speak, his present gift
BERTRAM:
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
BERTRAM:
Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
BERTRAM:
To the dark house and the detested wife.
PAROLLES:
Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?
BERTRAM:
Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
BERTRAM:
I'll send her straight away: to-morrow
BERTRAM:
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
PAROLLES:
Why, these balls bound, there's noise in it. 'Tis hard
PAROLLES:
A young man married is a man that's marr'd
PAROLLES:
Therefore away, and leave her bravely, go
PAROLLES:
The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.
PAROLLES:
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Paris. The KING's palace.
PAROLLES:
Enter HELENA and Clown
HELENA:
My mother greets me kindly, is she well?
Clown:
She is not well, but yet she has her health: she's
Clown:
very merry, but yet she is not well: but thanks be
Clown:
given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the
Clown:
world, but yet she is not well.
HELENA:
If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's
HELENA:
not very well?
Clown:
Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
HELENA:
What two things?
Clown:
One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her
Clown:
quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence
Clown:
God send her quickly!
Clown:
Enter PAROLLES
PAROLLES:
Bless you, my fortunate lady!
HELENA:
I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own
HELENA:
good fortunes.
PAROLLES:
You had my prayers to lead them on, and to keep them
PAROLLES:
on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
Clown:
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
Clown:
I would she did as you say.
PAROLLES:
Why, I say nothing.
Clown:
Marry, you are the wiser man, for many a man's
Clown:
tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say
Clown:
nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
Clown:
nothing, is to be a great part of your title, which
Clown:
is within a very little of nothing.
PAROLLES:
Away! thou'rt a knave.
Clown:
You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a
Clown:
knave, that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
Clown:
been truth, sir.
PAROLLES:
Go to, thou art a witty fool, I have found thee.
Clown:
Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
Clown:
taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable,
Clown:
and much fool may you find in you, even to the
Clown:
world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.
PAROLLES:
A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
PAROLLES:
Madam, my lord will go away to-night,
PAROLLES:
A very serious business calls on him.
PAROLLES:
The great prerogative and rite of love,
PAROLLES:
Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge,
PAROLLES:
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint,
PAROLLES:
Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
PAROLLES:
Which they distil now in the curbed time,
PAROLLES:
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
PAROLLES:
And pleasure drown the brim.
HELENA:
What's his will else?
PAROLLES:
That you will take your instant leave o' the king
PAROLLES:
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
PAROLLES:
Strengthen'd with what apology you think
PAROLLES:
May make it probable need.
HELENA:
What more commands he?
PAROLLES:
That, having this obtain'd, you presently
PAROLLES:
Attend his further pleasure.
HELENA:
In every thing I wait upon his will.
PAROLLES:
I shall report it so.
HELENA:
I pray you.
HELENA:
Exit PAROLLES
HELENA:
Come, sirrah.

Exeunt

HELENA:
Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM
LAFEU:
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
BERTRAM:
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
LAFEU:
You have it from his own deliverance.
BERTRAM:
And by other warranted testimony.
LAFEU:
Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.
BERTRAM:
I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in
BERTRAM:
knowledge and accordingly valiant.
LAFEU:
I have then sinned against his experience and
LAFEU:
transgressed against his valour, and my state that
LAFEU:
way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my
LAFEU:
heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make
LAFEU:
us friends, I will pursue the amity.
LAFEU:
Enter PAROLLES
PAROLLES:
[To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.
LAFEU:
Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
PAROLLES:
Sir?
LAFEU:
O, I know him well, I, sir, he, sir, 's a good
LAFEU:
workman, a very good tailor.
BERTRAM:
[Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the king?
PAROLLES:
She is.
BERTRAM:
Will she away to-night?
PAROLLES:
As you'll have her.
BERTRAM:
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
BERTRAM:
Given order for our horses, and to-night,
BERTRAM:
When I should take possession of the bride,
BERTRAM:
End ere I do begin.
LAFEU:
A good traveller is something at the latter end of a
LAFEU:
dinner, but one that lies three thirds and uses a
LAFEU:
known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should
LAFEU:
be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.
BERTRAM:
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
PAROLLES:
I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
PAROLLES:
displeasure.
LAFEU:
You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs
LAFEU:
and all, like him that leaped into the custard, and
LAFEU:
out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer
LAFEU:
question for your residence.
BERTRAM:
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
LAFEU:
And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's
LAFEU:
prayers. Fare you well, my lord, and believe this
LAFEU:
of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut, the
LAFEU:
soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
LAFEU:
matter of heavy consequence, I have kept of them
LAFEU:
tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur
LAFEU:
I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
LAFEU:
deserve at my hand, but we must do good against evil.
LAFEU:
Exit
PAROLLES:
An idle lord. I swear.
BERTRAM:
I think so.
PAROLLES:
Why, do you not know him?
BERTRAM:
Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
BERTRAM:
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.
BERTRAM:
Enter HELENA
HELENA:
I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
HELENA:
Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
HELENA:
For present parting, only he desires
HELENA:
Some private speech with you.
BERTRAM:
I shall obey his will.
BERTRAM:
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
BERTRAM:
Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
BERTRAM:
The ministration and required office
BERTRAM:
On my particular. Prepared I was not
BERTRAM:
For such a business, therefore am I found
BERTRAM:
So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
BERTRAM:
That presently you take our way for home,
BERTRAM:
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
BERTRAM:
For my respects are better than they seem
BERTRAM:
And my appointments have in them a need
BERTRAM:
Greater than shows itself at the first view
BERTRAM:
To you that know them not. This to my mother
BERTRAM:
Giving a letter
BERTRAM:
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
BERTRAM:
I leave you to your wisdom.
HELENA:
Sir, I can nothing say,
HELENA:
But that I am your most obedient servant.
BERTRAM:
Come, come, no more of that.
HELENA:
And ever shall
HELENA:
With true observance seek to eke out that
HELENA:
Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
HELENA:
To equal my great fortune.
BERTRAM:
Let that go
BERTRAM:
My haste is very great: farewell, hie home.
HELENA:
Pray, sir, your pardon.
BERTRAM:
Well, what would you say?
HELENA:
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
HELENA:
Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is,
HELENA:
But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
HELENA:
What law does vouch mine own.
BERTRAM:
What would you have?
HELENA:
Something, and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
HELENA:
I would not tell you what I would, my lord
HELENA:
Faith yes,
HELENA:
Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.
BERTRAM:
I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
HELENA:
I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
BERTRAM:
Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.
BERTRAM:
Exit HELENA
BERTRAM:
Go thou toward home, where I will never come
BERTRAM:
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.

PAROLLES:
Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence attended, the two Frenchmen, with a troop of soldiers.
DUKE:
So that from point to point now have you heard
DUKE:
The fundamental reasons of this war,
DUKE:
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
DUKE:
And more thirsts after.
First Lord:
Holy seems the quarrel
First Lord:
Upon your grace's part, black and fearful
First Lord:
On the opposer.
DUKE:
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
DUKE:
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
DUKE:
Against our borrowing prayers.
Second Lord:
Good my lord,
Second Lord:
The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
Second Lord:
But like a common and an outward man,
Second Lord:
That the great figure of a council frames
Second Lord:
By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
Second Lord:
Say what I think of it, since I have found
Second Lord:
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
Second Lord:
As often as I guess'd.
DUKE:
Be it his pleasure.
First Lord:
But I am sure the younger of our nature,
First Lord:
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
First Lord:
Come here for physic.
DUKE:
Welcome shall they be,

And all the honours that can fly from us

SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
DUKE:
Enter COUNTESS and Clown
COUNTESS:
It hath happened all as I would have had it, save
COUNTESS:
that he comes not along with her.
Clown:
By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
Clown:
melancholy man.
COUNTESS:
By what observance, I pray you?
Clown:
Why, he will look upon his boot and sing, mend the
Clown:
ruff and sing, ask questions and sing, pick his
Clown:
teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
Clown:
melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
COUNTESS:
Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
COUNTESS:
Opening a letter
Clown:
I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
Clown:
old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing
Clown:
like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court
Clown:
the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
Clown:
love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
COUNTESS:
What have we here?
Clown:
E'en that you have there.
Clown:
Exit
COUNTESS:
[Reads]  I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath
COUNTESS:
recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded
COUNTESS:
her, not bedded her, and sworn to make the 'not'
COUNTESS:
eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it
COUNTESS:
before the report come. If there be breadth enough
COUNTESS:
in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty
COUNTESS:
to you.	Your unfortunate son,
COUNTESS:
BERTRAM.
COUNTESS:
This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
COUNTESS:
To fly the favours of so good a king,

For the contempt of empire.

O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two

soldiers and my young lady!
COUNTESS:
What is the matter?
Clown:
Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
Clown:
comfort, your son will not be killed so soon as I
Clown:
thought he would.
COUNTESS:
Why should he be killed?
Clown:
So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does
Clown:
the danger is in standing to't, that's the loss of
Clown:
men, though it be the getting of children. Here

Second Gentleman:
Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence
Second Gentleman:
We met him thitherward, for thence we came,
Second Gentleman:
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
Second Gentleman:
Thither we bend again.
HELENA:
Look on his letter, madam, here's my passport.
HELENA:
Reads
HELENA:
When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
HELENA:
never shall come off, and show me a child begotten
HELENA:
of thy body that I am father to, then call me
HELENA:
husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
HELENA:
This is a dreadful sentence.
COUNTESS:
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
First Gentleman:
Ay, madam,
First Gentleman:
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.
COUNTESS:
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer,
COUNTESS:
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
COUNTESS:
Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son,
COUNTESS:
But I do wash his name out of my blood,
COUNTESS:
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
Second Gentleman:
Ay, madam.
COUNTESS:
And to be a soldier?
Second Gentleman:
Such is his noble purpose, and believe 't,
Second Gentleman:
The duke will lay upon him all the honour
Second Gentleman:
That good convenience claims.
COUNTESS:
Return you thither?
First Gentleman:
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
HELENA:
[Reads]  Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
HELENA:
'Tis bitter.
COUNTESS:
Find you that there?
HELENA:
Ay, madam.
First Gentleman:
'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his
First Gentleman:
heart was not consenting to.
COUNTESS:
Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
COUNTESS:
There's nothing here that is too good for him
COUNTESS:
But only she, and she deserves a lord
COUNTESS:
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
COUNTESS:
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
First Gentleman:
A servant only, and a gentleman
First Gentleman:
Which I have sometime known.
COUNTESS:
Parolles, was it not?
First Gentleman:
Ay, my good lady, he.
COUNTESS:
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
COUNTESS:
My son corrupts a well-derived nature
COUNTESS:
With his inducement.
First Gentleman:
Indeed, good lady,
First Gentleman:
The fellow has a deal of that too much,
First Gentleman:
Which holds him much to have.
COUNTESS:
You're welcome, gentlemen.
COUNTESS:
I will entreat you, when you see my son,
COUNTESS:
To tell him that his sword can never win
COUNTESS:
The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
COUNTESS:
Written to bear along.
Second Gentleman:
We serve you, madam,
Second Gentleman:
In that and all your worthiest affairs.
COUNTESS:
Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
COUNTESS:
Will you draw near!
COUNTESS:
Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen
HELENA:
'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
HELENA:
Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
HELENA:
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France,
HELENA:
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
HELENA:
That chase thee from thy country and expose
HELENA:
Those tender limbs of thine to the event
HELENA:
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
HELENA:
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
HELENA:
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
HELENA:
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
HELENA:
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
HELENA:
Fly with false aim, move the still-peering air,
HELENA:
That sings with piercing, do not touch my lord.
HELENA:
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there,
HELENA:
Whoever charges on his forward breast,
HELENA:
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't,
HELENA:
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
HELENA:
His death was so effected: better 'twere
HELENA:
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
HELENA:
With sharp constraint of hunger, better 'twere
HELENA:
That all the miseries which nature owes
HELENA:
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
HELENA:
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
HELENA:
As oft it loses all: I will be gone,
HELENA:
My being here it is that holds thee hence
HELENA:
Shall I stay here to do't?  no, no, although
HELENA:
The air of paradise did fan the house
HELENA:
And angels officed all: I will be gone,
HELENA:
That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
HELENA:
To consolate thine ear. Come, night, end, day!
HELENA:
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.
HELENA:
Exit
HELENA:
SCENE III. Florence. Before the DUKE's palace.
HELENA:
Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, Soldiers, Drum, and Trumpets
DUKE:
The general of our horse thou art, and we,
DUKE:
Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
DUKE:
Upon thy promising fortune.
BERTRAM:
Sir, it is
BERTRAM:
A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
BERTRAM:
We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
BERTRAM:
To the extreme edge of hazard.
DUKE:
Then go thou forth,
DUKE:
And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
DUKE:
As thy auspicious mistress!
BERTRAM:
This very day,
BERTRAM:
Great Mars, I put myself into thy file
BERTRAM:
Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
BERTRAM:
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.
BERTRAM:
Exeunt
BERTRAM:
SCENE IV. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
BERTRAM:
Enter COUNTESS and Steward
COUNTESS:
Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
COUNTESS:
Might you not know she would do as she has done,
COUNTESS:
By sending me a letter? Read it again.
Steward:
[Reads]
Steward:
I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone
Steward:
Ambitious love hath so in me offended,
Steward:
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
Steward:
With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
Steward:
Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
Steward:
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie
Steward:
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
Steward:
His name with zealous fervor sanctify
Steward:
His taken labours bid him me forgive,
Steward:
I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
Steward:
From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
Steward:
Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth
Steward:
He is too good and fair for death and me
Steward:
Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.
COUNTESS:
Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
COUNTESS:
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
COUNTESS:
As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,
COUNTESS:
I could have well diverted her intents,
COUNTESS:
Which thus she hath prevented.
Steward:
Pardon me, madam
Steward:
If I had given you this at over-night,
Steward:
She might have been o'erta'en, and yet she writes,
Steward:
Pursuit would be but vain.
COUNTESS:
What angel shall
COUNTESS:
Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
COUNTESS:
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
COUNTESS:
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
COUNTESS:
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
COUNTESS:
To this unworthy husband of his wife,
COUNTESS:
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
COUNTESS:
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
COUNTESS:
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
COUNTESS:
Dispatch the most convenient messenger
COUNTESS:
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
COUNTESS:
He will return, and hope I may that she,
COUNTESS:
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
COUNTESS:
Led hither by pure love: which of them both
COUNTESS:
Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
COUNTESS:
To make distinction: provide this messenger
COUNTESS:
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak,
COUNTESS:
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.
COUNTESS:
Exeunt
COUNTESS:
SCENE V. Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.
COUNTESS:
Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other Citizens
Widow:
Nay, come, for if they do approach the city, we
Widow:
shall lose all the sight.
DIANA:
They say the French count has done most honourable service.
Widow:
It is reported that he has taken their greatest
Widow:
commander, and that with his own hand he slew the
Widow:
duke's brother.
Widow:
Tucket
Widow:
We have lost our labour, they are gone a contrary
Widow:
way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.
MARIANA:
Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with
MARIANA:
the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this
MARIANA:
French earl: the honour of a maid is her name, and
MARIANA:
no legacy is so rich as honesty.
Widow:
I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
Widow:
by a gentleman his companion.
MARIANA:
I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles: a
MARIANA:
filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
MARIANA:
young earl. Beware of them, Diana, their promises,
MARIANA:
enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of
MARIANA:
lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid
MARIANA:
hath been seduced by them, and the misery is,
MARIANA:
example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of
MARIANA:
maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,
MARIANA:
but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
MARIANA:
them. I hope I need not to advise you further, but
MARIANA:
I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,
MARIANA:
though there were no further danger known but the
MARIANA:
modesty which is so lost.
DIANA:
You shall not need to fear me.
Widow:
I hope so.
Widow:
Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim
Widow:
Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at
Widow:
my house, thither they send one another: I'll
Widow:
question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?
HELENA:
To Saint Jaques le Grand.
HELENA:
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
Widow:
At the Saint Francis here beside the port.
HELENA:
Is this the way?
Widow:
Ay, marry, is't.
Widow:
A march afar
Widow:
Hark you! they come this way.
Widow:
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
Widow:
But till the troops come by,
Widow:
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged,
Widow:
The rather, for I think I know your hostess
Widow:
As ample as myself.
HELENA:
Is it yourself?
Widow:
If you shall please so, pilgrim.
HELENA:
I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
Widow:
You came, I think, from France?
HELENA:
I did so.
Widow:
Here you shall see a countryman of yours
Widow:
That has done worthy service.
HELENA:
His name, I pray you.
DIANA:
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
HELENA:
But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him
HELENA:
His face I know not.
DIANA:
Whatsome'er he is,
DIANA:
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
DIANA:
As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
DIANA:
Against his liking: think you it is so?
HELENA:
Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.
DIANA:
There is a gentleman that serves the count
DIANA:
Reports but coarsely of her.
HELENA:
What's his name?
DIANA:
Monsieur Parolles.
HELENA:
O, I believe with him,
HELENA:
In argument of praise, or to the worth
HELENA:
Of the great count himself, she is too mean
HELENA:
To have her name repeated: all her deserving
HELENA:
Is a reserved honesty, and that
HELENA:
I have not heard examined.
DIANA:
Alas, poor lady!
DIANA:
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
DIANA:
Of a detesting lord.
Widow:
I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,
Widow:
Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her
Widow:
A shrewd turn, if she pleased.
HELENA:
How do you mean?
HELENA:
May be the amorous count solicits her
HELENA:
In the unlawful purpose.
Widow:
He does indeed,
Widow:
And brokes with all that can in such a suit
Widow:
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid
Widow:
But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
Widow:
In honestest defence.
MARIANA:
The gods forbid else!
Widow:
So, now they come
Widow:
Drum and Colours
Widow:
Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army
Widow:
That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son,
Widow:
That, Escalus.
HELENA:
Which is the Frenchman?
DIANA:
He,
DIANA:
That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
DIANA:
I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
DIANA:
He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?
HELENA:
I like him well.
DIANA:
'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
DIANA:
That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
DIANA:
I would Poison that vile rascal.
HELENA:
Which is he?
DIANA:
That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?
HELENA:
Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.
PAROLLES:
Lose our drum! well.
MARIANA:
He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.
Widow:
Marry, hang you!
MARIANA:
And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
MARIANA:
Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and army
Widow:
The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
Widow:
Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents
Widow:
There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
Widow:
Already at my house.
HELENA:
I humbly thank you
HELENA:
Please it this matron and this gentle maid
HELENA:
To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
HELENA:
Shall be for me, and, to requite you further,
HELENA:
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
HELENA:
Worthy the note.
BOTH:
We'll take your offer kindly.
BOTH:
Exeunt
BOTH:
SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.
BOTH:
Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords
Second Lord:
Nay, good my lord, put him to't, let him have his
Second Lord:
way.
First Lord:
If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no
First Lord:
more in your respect.
Second Lord:
On my life, my lord, a bubble.
BERTRAM:
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
Second Lord:
Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
Second Lord:
without any malice, but to speak of him as my
Second Lord:
kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
Second Lord:
endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
Second Lord:
of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
Second Lord:
entertainment.
First Lord:
It were fit you knew him, lest, reposing too far in
First Lord:
his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
First Lord:
great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.
BERTRAM:
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
First Lord:
None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
First Lord:
which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
Second Lord:
I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
Second Lord:
surprise him, such I will have, whom I am sure he
Second Lord:
knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
Second Lord:
him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
Second Lord:
is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
Second Lord:
we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
Second Lord:
present at his examination: if he do not, for the
Second Lord:
promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
Second Lord:
base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
Second Lord:
intelligence in his power against you, and that with
Second Lord:
the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
Second Lord:
trust my judgment in any thing.
First Lord:
O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum,
First Lord:
he says he has a stratagem for't: when your
First Lord:
lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to
First Lord:
what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
First Lord:
melted, if you give him not John Drum's
First Lord:
entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
First Lord:
Here he comes.
First Lord:
Enter PAROLLES
Second Lord:
[Aside to BERTRAM]  O, for the love of laughter,
Second Lord:
hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch
Second Lord:
off his drum in any hand.
BERTRAM:
How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
BERTRAM:
disposition.
First Lord:
A pox on't, let it go, 'tis but a drum.
PAROLLES:
'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!
PAROLLES:
There was excellent command,--to charge in with our
PAROLLES:
horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
First Lord:
That was not to be blamed in the command of the
First Lord:
service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
First Lord:
himself could not have prevented, if he had been
First Lord:
there to command.
BERTRAM:
Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
BERTRAM:
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum, but it is
BERTRAM:
not to be recovered.
PAROLLES:
It might have been recovered.
BERTRAM:
It might, but it is not now.
PAROLLES:
It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
PAROLLES:
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
PAROLLES:
performer, I would have that drum or another, or
PAROLLES:
'hic jacet.'
BERTRAM:
Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
BERTRAM:
think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
BERTRAM:
instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
BERTRAM:
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on, I will
BERTRAM:
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
BERTRAM:
speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
BERTRAM:
and extend to you what further becomes his
BERTRAM:
greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
BERTRAM:
worthiness.
PAROLLES:
By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
BERTRAM:
But you must not now slumber in it.
PAROLLES:
I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
PAROLLES:
pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
PAROLLES:
certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation,
PAROLLES:
and by midnight look to hear further from me.
BERTRAM:
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?
PAROLLES:
I know not what the success will be, my lord, but
PAROLLES:
the attempt I vow.
BERTRAM:
I know thou'rt valiant, and, to the possibility of
BERTRAM:
thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
PAROLLES:
I love not many words.
PAROLLES:
Exit
Second Lord:
No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
Second Lord:
strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
Second Lord:
to undertake this business, which he knows is not to
Second Lord:
be done, damns himself to do and dares better be
Second Lord:
damned than to do't?
First Lord:
You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it
First Lord:
is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
First Lord:
for a week escape a great deal of discoveries, but
First Lord:
when you find him out, you have him ever after.
BERTRAM:
Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
BERTRAM:
this that so seriously he does address himself unto?
Second Lord:
None in the world, but return with an invention and
Second Lord:
clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
Second Lord:
have almost embossed him, you shall see his fall
Second Lord:
to-night, for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.
First Lord:
We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
First Lord:
him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu
First Lord:
when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a
First Lord:
sprat you shall find him, which you shall see this
First Lord:
very night.
Second Lord:
I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
BERTRAM:
Your brother he shall go along with me.
Second Lord:
As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.
Second Lord:
Exit
BERTRAM:
Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
BERTRAM:
The lass I spoke of.
First Lord:
But you say she's honest.
BERTRAM:
That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
BERTRAM:
And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her,
BERTRAM:
By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
BERTRAM:
Tokens and letters which she did re-send,
BERTRAM:
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature
BERTRAM:
Will you go see her?
First Lord:
With all my heart, my lord.
First Lord:
Exeunt
First Lord:
SCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.
First Lord:
Enter HELENA and Widow
HELENA:
If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
HELENA:
I know not how I shall assure you further,
HELENA:
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
Widow:
Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,
Widow:
Nothing acquainted with these businesses,
Widow:
And would not put my reputation now
Widow:
In any staining act.
HELENA:
Nor would I wish you.
HELENA:
First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,
HELENA:
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
HELENA:
Is so from word to word, and then you cannot,
HELENA:
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
HELENA:
Err in bestowing it.
Widow:
I should believe you
Widow:
For you have show'd me that which well approves
Widow:
You're great in fortune.
HELENA:
Take this purse of gold,
HELENA:
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
HELENA:
Which I will over-pay and pay again
HELENA:
When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
HELENA:
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
HELENA:
Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
HELENA:
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
HELENA:
Now his important blood will nought deny
HELENA:
That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
HELENA:
That downward hath succeeded in his house
HELENA:
From son to son, some four or five descents
HELENA:
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
HELENA:
In most rich choice, yet in his idle fire,
HELENA:
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
HELENA:
Howe'er repented after.
Widow:
Now I see
Widow:
The bottom of your purpose.
HELENA:
You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
HELENA:
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
HELENA:
Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter,
HELENA:
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
HELENA:
Herself most chastely absent: after this,
HELENA:
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
HELENA:
To what is passed already.
Widow:
I have yielded
Widow:
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
Widow:
That time and place with this deceit so lawful
Widow:
May prove coherent. Every night he comes
Widow:
With musics of all sorts and songs composed
Widow:
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
Widow:
To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
Widow:
As if his life lay on't.
HELENA:
Why then to-night
HELENA:
Let us assay our plot, which, if it speed,
HELENA:
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
HELENA:
And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
HELENA:
Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact
HELENA:
But let's about it.
HELENA:
Exeunt
HELENA:
ACT IV
HELENA:
SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.
HELENA:
Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush
Second Lord:
He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
Second Lord:
When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
Second Lord:
language you will: though you understand it not
Second Lord:
yourselves, no matter, for we must not seem to
Second Lord:
understand him, unless some one among us whom we
Second Lord:
must produce for an interpreter.
First Soldier:
Good captain, let me be the interpreter.
Second Lord:
Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?
First Soldier:
No, sir, I warrant you.
Second Lord:
But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
First Soldier:
E'en such as you speak to me.
Second Lord:
He must think us some band of strangers i' the
Second Lord:
adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
Second Lord:
all neighbouring languages, therefore we must every
Second Lord:
one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we
Second Lord:
speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to
Second Lord:
know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
Second Lord:
gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,
Second Lord:
interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,
Second Lord:
ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,
Second Lord:
and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
Second Lord:
Enter PAROLLES
PAROLLES:
Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
PAROLLES:
time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
PAROLLES:
done? It must be a very plausive invention that
PAROLLES:
carries it: they begin to smoke me, and disgraces
PAROLLES:
have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
PAROLLES:
my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the
PAROLLES:
fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not
PAROLLES:
daring the reports of my tongue.
Second Lord:
This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
Second Lord:
was guilty of.
PAROLLES:
What the devil should move me to undertake the
PAROLLES:
recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the
PAROLLES:
impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
PAROLLES:
must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in
PAROLLES:
exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it, they
PAROLLES:
will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great
PAROLLES:
ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the
PAROLLES:
instance? Tongue, I must put you into a
PAROLLES:
butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
PAROLLES:
Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
Second Lord:
Is it possible he should know what he is, and be
Second Lord:
that he is?
PAROLLES:
I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
PAROLLES:
turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
Second Lord:
We cannot afford you so.
PAROLLES:
Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in
PAROLLES:
stratagem.
Second Lord:
'Twould not do.
PAROLLES:
Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.
Second Lord:
Hardly serve.
PAROLLES:
Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
Second Lord:
How deep?
PAROLLES:
Thirty fathom.
Second Lord:
Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
PAROLLES:
I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
PAROLLES:
I recovered it.
Second Lord:
You shall hear one anon.
PAROLLES:
A drum now of the enemy's,--
PAROLLES:
Alarum within
Second Lord:
Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
All:
Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.
PAROLLES:
O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.
PAROLLES:
They seize and blindfold him
First Soldier:
Boskos thromuldo boskos.
PAROLLES:
I know you are the Muskos' regiment
PAROLLES:
And I shall lose my life for want of language,
PAROLLES:
If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,
PAROLLES:
Italian, or French, let him speak to me, I'll
PAROLLES:
Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
First Soldier:
Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak
First Soldier:
thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy
First Soldier:
faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
PAROLLES:
O!
First Soldier:
O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
Second Lord:
Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
First Soldier:
The general is content to spare thee yet,
First Soldier:
And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
First Soldier:
To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform
First Soldier:
Something to save thy life.
PAROLLES:
O, let me live!
PAROLLES:
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
PAROLLES:
Their force, their purposes, nay, I'll speak that
PAROLLES:
Which you will wonder at.
First Soldier:
But wilt thou faithfully?
PAROLLES:
If I do not, damn me.
First Soldier:
Acordo linta.
First Soldier:
Come on, thou art granted space.
First Soldier:
Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within
Second Lord:
Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,
Second Lord:
We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
Second Lord:
Till we do hear from them.
Second Soldier:
Captain, I will.
Second Lord:
A' will betray us all unto ourselves
Second Lord:
Inform on that.
Second Soldier:
So I will, sir.
Second Lord:
Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
Second Lord:
Exeunt
Second Lord:
SCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house.
Second Lord:
Enter BERTRAM and DIANA
BERTRAM:
They told me that your name was Fontibell.
DIANA:
No, my good lord, Diana.
BERTRAM:
Titled goddess,
BERTRAM:
And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
BERTRAM:
In your fine frame hath love no quality?
BERTRAM:
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
BERTRAM:
You are no maiden, but a monument
BERTRAM:
When you are dead, you should be such a one
BERTRAM:
As you are now, for you are cold and stem,
BERTRAM:
And now you should be as your mother was
BERTRAM:
When your sweet self was got.
DIANA:
She then was honest.
BERTRAM:
So should you be.
DIANA:
No
DIANA:
My mother did but duty, such, my lord,
DIANA:
As you owe to your wife.
BERTRAM:
No more o' that,
BERTRAM:
I prithee, do not strive against my vows
BERTRAM:
I was compell'd to her, but I love thee
BERTRAM:
By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
BERTRAM:
Do thee all rights of service.
DIANA:
Ay, so you serve us
DIANA:
Till we serve you, but when you have our roses,
DIANA:
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
DIANA:
And mock us with our bareness.
BERTRAM:
How have I sworn!
DIANA:
'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
DIANA:
But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
DIANA:
What is not holy, that we swear not by,
DIANA:
But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
DIANA:
If I should swear by God's great attributes,
DIANA:
I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
DIANA:
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
DIANA:
To swear by him whom I protest to love,
DIANA:
That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
DIANA:
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
DIANA:
At least in my opinion.
BERTRAM:
Change it, change it,
BERTRAM:
Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy,
BERTRAM:
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
BERTRAM:
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
BERTRAM:
But give thyself unto my sick desires,
BERTRAM:
Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
BERTRAM:
My love as it begins shall so persever.
DIANA:
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
DIANA:
That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
BERTRAM:
I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power
BERTRAM:
To give it from me.
DIANA:
Will you not, my lord?
BERTRAM:
It is an honour 'longing to our house,
BERTRAM:
Bequeathed down from many ancestors,
BERTRAM:
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
BERTRAM:
In me to lose.
DIANA:
Mine honour's such a ring
DIANA:
My chastity's the jewel of our house,
DIANA:
Bequeathed down from many ancestors,
DIANA:
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
DIANA:
In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
DIANA:
Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
DIANA:
Against your vain assault.
BERTRAM:
Here, take my ring
BERTRAM:
My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
BERTRAM:
And I'll be bid by thee.
DIANA:
When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window
DIANA:
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
DIANA:
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
DIANA:
When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
DIANA:
Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me
DIANA:
My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them
DIANA:
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd
DIANA:
And on your finger in the night I'll put
DIANA:
Another ring, that what in time proceeds
DIANA:
May token to the future our past deeds.
DIANA:
Adieu, till then, then, fail not. You have won
DIANA:
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
BERTRAM:
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
BERTRAM:
Exit
DIANA:
For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
DIANA:
You may so in the end.
DIANA:
My mother told me just how he would woo,
DIANA:
As if she sat in 's heart, she says all men
DIANA:
Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
DIANA:
When his wife's dead, therefore I'll lie with him
DIANA:
When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
DIANA:
Marry that will, I live and die a maid
DIANA:
Only in this disguise I think't no sin
DIANA:
To cozen him that would unjustly win.
DIANA:
Exit
DIANA:
SCENE III. The Florentine camp.
DIANA:
Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers
First Lord:
You have not given him his mother's letter?
Second Lord:
I have delivered it an hour since: there is
Second Lord:
something in't that stings his nature, for on the
Second Lord:
reading it he changed almost into another man.
First Lord:
He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
First Lord:
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
Second Lord:
Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
Second Lord:
displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his
Second Lord:
bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
Second Lord:
thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
First Lord:
When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the
First Lord:
grave of it.
Second Lord:
He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
Second Lord:
Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he
Second Lord:
fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
Second Lord:
given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself
Second Lord:
made in the unchaste composition.
First Lord:
Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
First Lord:
what things are we!
Second Lord:
Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
Second Lord:
of all treasons, we still see them reveal
Second Lord:
themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
Second Lord:
so he that in this action contrives against his own
Second Lord:
nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.
First Lord:
Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
First Lord:
our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
First Lord:
company to-night?
Second Lord:
Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to his hour.
First Lord:
That approaches apace, I would gladly have him see
First Lord:
his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
First Lord:
of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
First Lord:
set this counterfeit.
Second Lord:
We will not meddle with him till he come, for his
Second Lord:
presence must be the whip of the other.
First Lord:
In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?
Second Lord:
I hear there is an overture of peace.
First Lord:
Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
Second Lord:
What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
Second Lord:
higher, or return again into France?
First Lord:
I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
First Lord:
of his council.
Second Lord:
Let it be forbid, sir, so should I be a great deal
Second Lord:
of his act.
First Lord:
Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
First Lord:
house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
First Lord:
le Grand, which holy undertaking with most austere
First Lord:
sanctimony she accomplished, and, there residing the
First Lord:
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
First Lord:
grief, in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
First Lord:
now she sings in heaven.
Second Lord:
How is this justified?
First Lord:
The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
First Lord:
makes her story true, even to the point of her
First Lord:
death: her death itself, which could not be her
First Lord:
office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
First Lord:
the rector of the place.
Second Lord:
Hath the count all this intelligence?
First Lord:
Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
First Lord:
point, so to the full arming of the verity.
Second Lord:
I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
First Lord:
How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
Second Lord:
And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
Second Lord:
in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
Second Lord:
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
Second Lord:
with a shame as ample.
First Lord:
The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
First Lord:
ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
First Lord:
faults whipped them not, and our crimes would
First Lord:
despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.
First Lord:
Enter a Messenger
First Lord:
How now! where's your master?
Servant:
He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
Servant:
taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
Servant:
morning for France. The duke hath offered him
Servant:
letters of commendations to the king.
Second Lord:
They shall be no more than needful there, if they
Second Lord:
were more than they can commend.
First Lord:
They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
First Lord:
Here's his lordship now.
First Lord:
Enter BERTRAM
First Lord:
How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?
BERTRAM:
I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
BERTRAM:
month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success
BERTRAM:
I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
BERTRAM:
nearest, buried a wife, mourned for her, writ to my
BERTRAM:
lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy,
BERTRAM:
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
BERTRAM:
many nicer needs, the last was the greatest, but
BERTRAM:
that I have not ended yet.
Second Lord:
If the business be of any difficulty, and this
Second Lord:
morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
Second Lord:
your lordship.
BERTRAM:
I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
BERTRAM:
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
BERTRAM:
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
BERTRAM:
bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
BERTRAM:
me, like a double-meaning prophesier.
Second Lord:
Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
Second Lord:
poor gallant knave.
BERTRAM:
No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
BERTRAM:
his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
Second Lord:
I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
Second Lord:
him. But to answer you as you would be understood,
Second Lord:
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
Second Lord:
hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
Second Lord:
to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
Second Lord:
this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
Second Lord:
stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?
BERTRAM:
Nothing of me, has a'?
Second Lord:
His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
Second Lord:
face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you
Second Lord:
are, you must have the patience to hear it.
Second Lord:
Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier
BERTRAM:
A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
BERTRAM:
me: hush, hush!
First Lord:
Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa
First Soldier:
He calls for the tortures: what will you say
First Soldier:
without 'em?
PAROLLES:
I will confess what I know without constraint: if
PAROLLES:
ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
First Soldier:
Bosko chimurcho.
First Lord:
Boblibindo chicurmurco.
First Soldier:
You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
First Soldier:
answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
PAROLLES:
And truly, as I hope to live.
First Soldier:
[Reads]  'First demand of him how many horse the
First Soldier:
duke is strong.' What say you to that?
PAROLLES:
Five or six thousand, but very weak and
PAROLLES:
unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
PAROLLES:
the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
PAROLLES:
and credit and as I hope to live.
First Soldier:
Shall I set down your answer so?
PAROLLES:
Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.
BERTRAM:
All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
First Lord:
You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
First Lord:
Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
First Lord:
phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
First Lord:
knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
First Lord:
his dagger.
Second Lord:
I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
Second Lord:
clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
Second Lord:
by wearing his apparel neatly.
First Soldier:
Well, that's set down.
PAROLLES:
Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say
PAROLLES:
true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.
First Lord:
He's very near the truth in this.
BERTRAM:
But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
BERTRAM:
delivers it.
PAROLLES:
Poor rogues, I pray you, say.
First Soldier:
Well, that's set down.
PAROLLES:
I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
PAROLLES:
rogues are marvellous poor.
First Soldier:
[Reads]  'Demand of him, of what strength they are
First Soldier:
a-foot.' What say you to that?
PAROLLES:
By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
PAROLLES:
hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
PAROLLES:
hundred and fifty, Sebastian, so many, Corambus, so
PAROLLES:
many, Jaques, so many, Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
PAROLLES:
and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each, mine own
PAROLLES:
company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
PAROLLES:
fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
PAROLLES:
sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
PAROLLES:
poll, half of the which dare not shake snow from off
PAROLLES:
their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.
BERTRAM:
What shall be done to him?
First Lord:
Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
First Lord:
condition, and what credit I have with the duke.
First Soldier:
Well, that's set down.
First Soldier:
Reads
First Soldier:
'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
First Soldier:
be i' the camp, a Frenchman, what his reputation is
First Soldier:
with the duke, what his valour, honesty, and
First Soldier:
expertness in wars, or whether he thinks it were not
First Soldier:
possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
First Soldier:
corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what
First Soldier:
do you know of it?
PAROLLES:
I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
PAROLLES:
the inter'gatories: demand them singly.
First Soldier:
Do you know this Captain Dumain?
PAROLLES:
I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,
PAROLLES:
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
PAROLLES:
fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not
PAROLLES:
say him nay.
BERTRAM:
Nay, by your leave, hold your hands, though I know
BERTRAM:
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
First Soldier:
Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?
PAROLLES:
Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
First Lord:
Nay look not so upon me, we shall hear of your
First Lord:
lordship anon.
First Soldier:
What is his reputation with the duke?
PAROLLES:
The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
PAROLLES:
of mine, and writ to me this other day to turn him
PAROLLES:
out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.
First Soldier:
Marry, we'll search.
PAROLLES:
In good sadness, I do not know, either it is there,
PAROLLES:
or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
PAROLLES:
in my tent.
First Soldier:
Here 'tis, here's a paper: shall I read it to you?
PAROLLES:
I do not know if it be it or no.
BERTRAM:
Our interpreter does it well.
First Lord:
Excellently.
First Soldier:
[Reads]  'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--
PAROLLES:
That is not the duke's letter, sir, that is an
PAROLLES:
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
PAROLLES:
Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
PAROLLES:
Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
PAROLLES:
ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.
First Soldier:
Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.
PAROLLES:
My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
PAROLLES:
behalf of the maid, for I knew the young count to be
PAROLLES:
a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
PAROLLES:
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.
BERTRAM:
Damnable both-sides rogue!
First Soldier:
[Reads]  'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it,
First Soldier:
After he scores, he never pays the score
First Soldier:
Half won is match well made, match, and well make it,
First Soldier:
He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before,
First Soldier:
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
First Soldier:
Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss
First Soldier:
For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
First Soldier:
Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
First Soldier:
Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
First Soldier:
PAROLLES.'
BERTRAM:
He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
BERTRAM:
in's forehead.
Second Lord:
This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
Second Lord:
linguist and the armipotent soldier.
BERTRAM:
I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
BERTRAM:
he's a cat to me.
First Soldier:
I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be
First Soldier:
fain to hang you.
PAROLLES:
My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
PAROLLES:
die, but that, my offences being many, I would
PAROLLES:
repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
PAROLLES:
sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.
First Soldier:
We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely,
First Soldier:
therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
First Soldier:
have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
First Soldier:
his valour: what is his honesty?
PAROLLES:
He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
PAROLLES:
rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
PAROLLES:
professes not keeping of oaths, in breaking 'em he
PAROLLES:
is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
PAROLLES:
such volubility, that you would think truth were a
PAROLLES:
fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
PAROLLES:
be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little
PAROLLES:
harm, save to his bed-clothes about him, but they
PAROLLES:
know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
PAROLLES:
little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
PAROLLES:
every thing that an honest man should not have, what
PAROLLES:
an honest man should have, he has nothing.
First Lord:
I begin to love him for this.
BERTRAM:
For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
BERTRAM:
him for me, he's more and more a cat.
First Soldier:
What say you to his expertness in war?
PAROLLES:
Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
PAROLLES:
tragedians, to belie him, I will not, and more of
PAROLLES:
his soldiership I know not, except, in that country
PAROLLES:
he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
PAROLLES:
called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
PAROLLES:
files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
PAROLLES:
this I am not certain.
First Lord:
He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
First Lord:
rarity redeems him.
BERTRAM:
A pox on him, he's a cat still.
First Soldier:
His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
First Soldier:
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
PAROLLES:
Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple
PAROLLES:
of his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cut the
PAROLLES:
entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
PAROLLES:
succession for it perpetually.
First Soldier:
What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
Second Lord:
Why does be ask him of me?
First Soldier:
What's he?
PAROLLES:
E'en a crow o' the same nest, not altogether so
PAROLLES:
great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
PAROLLES:
deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
PAROLLES:
yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is
PAROLLES:
in a retreat he outruns any lackey, marry, in coming
PAROLLES:
on he has the cramp.
First Soldier:
If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
First Soldier:
the Florentine?
PAROLLES:
Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.
First Soldier:
I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.
PAROLLES:
[Aside]  I'll no more drumming, a plague of all
PAROLLES:
drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
PAROLLES:
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
PAROLLES:
the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
PAROLLES:
would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
First Soldier:
There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
First Soldier:
general says, you that have so traitorously
First Soldier:
discovered the secrets of your army and made such
First Soldier:
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can
First Soldier:
serve the world for no honest use, therefore you
First Soldier:
must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.
PAROLLES:
O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
First Lord:
That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.
First Lord:
Unblinding him
First Lord:
So, look about you: know you any here?
BERTRAM:
Good morrow, noble captain.
Second Lord:
God bless you, Captain Parolles.
First Lord:
God save you, noble captain.
Second Lord:
Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?
Second Lord:
I am for France.
First Lord:
Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
First Lord:
you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
First Lord:
an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you
First Lord:
but fare you well.
First Lord:
Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords
First Soldier:
You are undone, captain, all but your scarf, that
First Soldier:
has a knot on't yet
PAROLLES:
Who cannot be crushed with a plot?
First Soldier:
If you could find out a country where but women were
First Soldier:
that had received so much shame, you might begin an
First Soldier:
impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir, I am for France
First Soldier:
too: we shall speak of you there.
First Soldier:
Exit with Soldiers
PAROLLES:
Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,
PAROLLES:
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more,
PAROLLES:
But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
PAROLLES:
As captain shall: simply the thing I am
PAROLLES:
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
PAROLLES:
Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
PAROLLES:
that every braggart shall be found an ass.
PAROLLES:
Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
PAROLLES:
Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!
PAROLLES:
There's place and means for every man alive.
PAROLLES:
I'll after them.
PAROLLES:
Exit
PAROLLES:
SCENE IV. Florence. The Widow's house.
PAROLLES:
Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA
HELENA:
That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,
HELENA:
One of the greatest in the Christian world
HELENA:
Shall be my surety, 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,
HELENA:
Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel
HELENA:
Time was, I did him a desired office,
HELENA:
Dear almost as his life, which gratitude
HELENA:
Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
HELENA:
And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd
HELENA:
His grace is at Marseilles, to which place
HELENA:
We have convenient convoy. You must know
HELENA:
I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
HELENA:
My husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding,
HELENA:
And by the leave of my good lord the king,
HELENA:
We'll be before our welcome.
Widow:
Gentle madam,
Widow:
You never had a servant to whose trust
Widow:
Your business was more welcome.
HELENA:
Nor you, mistress,
HELENA:
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
HELENA:
To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven
HELENA:
Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
HELENA:
As it hath fated her to be my motive
HELENA:
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
HELENA:
That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
HELENA:
When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
HELENA:
Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play
HELENA:
With what it loathes for that which is away.
HELENA:
But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
HELENA:
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
HELENA:
Something in my behalf.
DIANA:
Let death and honesty
DIANA:
Go with your impositions, I am yours
DIANA:
Upon your will to suffer.
HELENA:
Yet, I pray you
HELENA:
But with the word the time will bring on summer,
HELENA:
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
HELENA:
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away,
HELENA:
Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us
HELENA:
All's well that ends well, still the fine's the crown,
HELENA:
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.
HELENA:
Exeunt
HELENA:
SCENE V. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
HELENA:
Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown
LAFEU:
No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
LAFEU:
fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
LAFEU:
made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
LAFEU:
his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
LAFEU:
this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
LAFEU:
by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.
COUNTESS:
I would I had not known him, it was the death of the
COUNTESS:
most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
COUNTESS:
praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
COUNTESS:
flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
COUNTESS:
could not have owed her a more rooted love.
LAFEU:
'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
LAFEU:
thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.
Clown:
Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
Clown:
salad, or rather, the herb of grace.
LAFEU:
They are not herbs, you knave, they are nose-herbs.
Clown:
I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir, I have not much
Clown:
skill in grass.
LAFEU:
Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?
Clown:
A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
LAFEU:
Your distinction?
Clown:
I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.
LAFEU:
So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
Clown:
And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
LAFEU:
I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.
Clown:
At your service.
LAFEU:
No, no, no.
Clown:
Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
Clown:
great a prince as you are.
LAFEU:
Who's that? a Frenchman?
Clown:
Faith, sir, a' has an English name, but his fisnomy
Clown:
is more hotter in France than there.
LAFEU:
What prince is that?
Clown:
The black prince, sir, alias, the prince of
Clown:
darkness, alias, the devil.
LAFEU:
Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
LAFEU:
to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of,
LAFEU:
serve him still.
Clown:
I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
Clown:
great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a
Clown:
good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
Clown:
world, let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
Clown:
the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
Clown:
too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
Clown:
themselves may, but the many will be too chill and
Clown:
tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
Clown:
leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
LAFEU:
Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee, and I
LAFEU:
tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
LAFEU:
with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
LAFEU:
looked to, without any tricks.
Clown:
If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
Clown:
jades' tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.
Clown:
Exit
LAFEU:
A shrewd knave and an unhappy.
COUNTESS:
So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
COUNTESS:
sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
COUNTESS:
which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness, and,
COUNTESS:
indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.
LAFEU:
I like him well, 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
LAFEU:
tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
LAFEU:
that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
LAFEU:
moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
LAFEU:
my daughter, which, in the minority of them both,
LAFEU:
his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
LAFEU:
first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
LAFEU:
it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
LAFEU:
conceived against your son, there is no fitter
LAFEU:
matter. How does your ladyship like it?
COUNTESS:
With very much content, my lord, and I wish it
COUNTESS:
happily effected.
LAFEU:
His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
LAFEU:
body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
LAFEU:
to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
LAFEU:
intelligence hath seldom failed.
COUNTESS:
It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
COUNTESS:
die. I have letters that my son will be here
COUNTESS:
to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
COUNTESS:
with me till they meet together.
LAFEU:
Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
LAFEU:
safely be admitted.
COUNTESS:
You need but plead your honourable privilege.
LAFEU:
Lady, of that I have made a bold charter, but I
LAFEU:
thank my God it holds yet.
LAFEU:
Re-enter Clown
Clown:
O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
Clown:
velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
Clown:
or no, the velvet knows, but 'tis a goodly patch of
Clown:
velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
Clown:
half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
LAFEU:
A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
LAFEU:
of honour, so belike is that.
Clown:
But it is your carbonadoed face.
LAFEU:
Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
LAFEU:
with the young noble soldier.
Clown:
Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
Clown:
hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
Clown:
and nod at every man.
Clown:
Exeunt
Clown:
ACT V
Clown:
SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.
Clown:
Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA, with two Attendants
HELENA:
But this exceeding posting day and night
HELENA:
Must wear your spirits low, we cannot help it
HELENA:
But since you have made the days and nights as one,
HELENA:
To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
HELENA:
Be bold you do so grow in my requital
HELENA:
As nothing can unroot you. In happy time,
HELENA:
Enter a Gentleman
HELENA:
This man may help me to his majesty's ear,
HELENA:
If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.
Gentleman:
And you.
HELENA:
Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
Gentleman:
I have been sometimes there.
HELENA:
I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
HELENA:
From the report that goes upon your goodness,
HELENA:
An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
HELENA:
Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
HELENA:
The use of your own virtues, for the which
HELENA:
I shall continue thankful.
Gentleman:
What's your will?
HELENA:
That it will please you
HELENA:
To give this poor petition to the king,
HELENA:
And aid me with that store of power you have
HELENA:
To come into his presence.
Gentleman:
The king's not here.
HELENA:
Not here, sir!
Gentleman:
Not, indeed
Gentleman:
He hence removed last night and with more haste
Gentleman:
Than is his use.
Widow:
Lord, how we lose our pains!
HELENA:
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,
HELENA:
Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
HELENA:
I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
Gentleman:
Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon,
Gentleman:
Whither I am going.
HELENA:
I do beseech you, sir,
HELENA:
Since you are like to see the king before me,
HELENA:
Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
HELENA:
Which I presume shall render you no blame
HELENA:
But rather make you thank your pains for it.
HELENA:
I will come after you with what good speed
HELENA:
Our means will make us means.
Gentleman:
This I'll do for you.
HELENA:
And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
HELENA:
Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.
HELENA:
Go, go, provide.
HELENA:
Exeunt
HELENA:
SCENE II. Rousillon. Before the COUNT's palace.
HELENA:
Enter Clown, and PAROLLES, following
PAROLLES:
Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this
PAROLLES:
letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to
PAROLLES:
you, when I have held familiarity with fresher
PAROLLES:
clothes, but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's
PAROLLES:
mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
PAROLLES:
displeasure.
Clown:
Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it
Clown:
smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will
Clown:
henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.
Clown:
Prithee, allow the wind.
PAROLLES:
Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir, I spake
PAROLLES:
but by a metaphor.
Clown:
Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my
Clown:
nose, or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get
Clown:
thee further.
PAROLLES:
Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
Clown:
Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's
Clown:
close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he
Clown:
comes himself.
Clown:
Enter LAFEU
Clown:
Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's
Clown:
cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the
Clown:
unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he
Clown:
says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the
Clown:
carp as you may, for he looks like a poor, decayed,
Clown:
ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his
Clown:
distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to
Clown:
your lordship.
Clown:
Exit
PAROLLES:
My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly
PAROLLES:
scratched.
LAFEU:
And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to
LAFEU:
pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the
LAFEU:
knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
LAFEU:
of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves
LAFEU:
thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for
LAFEU:
you: let the justices make you and fortune friends
LAFEU:
I am for other business.
PAROLLES:
I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
LAFEU:
You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't,
LAFEU:
save your word.
PAROLLES:
My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
LAFEU:
You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion!
LAFEU:
give me your hand. How does your drum?
PAROLLES:
O my good lord, you were the first that found me!
LAFEU:
Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.
PAROLLES:
It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,
PAROLLES:
for you did bring me out.
LAFEU:
Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once
LAFEU:
both the office of God and the devil? One brings
LAFEU:
thee in grace and the other brings thee out.
LAFEU:
Trumpets sound
LAFEU:
The king's coming, I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,
LAFEU:
inquire further after me, I had talk of you last
LAFEU:
night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall
LAFEU:
eat, go to, follow.
PAROLLES:
I praise God for you.
PAROLLES:
Exeunt
PAROLLES:
SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
PAROLLES:
Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with Attendants
KING:
We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem
KING:
Was made much poorer by it: but your son,
KING:
As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
KING:
Her estimation home.
COUNTESS:
'Tis past, my liege,
COUNTESS:
And I beseech your majesty to make it
COUNTESS:
Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth,
COUNTESS:
When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
COUNTESS:
O'erbears it and burns on.
KING:
My honour'd lady,
KING:
I have forgiven and forgotten all,
KING:
Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
KING:
And watch'd the time to shoot.
LAFEU:
This I must say,
LAFEU:
But first I beg my pardon, the young lord
LAFEU:
Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady
LAFEU:
Offence of mighty note, but to himself
LAFEU:
The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
LAFEU:
Whose beauty did astonish the survey
LAFEU:
Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
LAFEU:
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
LAFEU:
Humbly call'd mistress.
KING:
Praising what is lost
KING:
Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither,
KING:
We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
KING:
All repetition: let him not ask our pardon,
KING:
The nature of his great offence is dead,
KING:
And deeper than oblivion we do bury
KING:
The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
KING:
A stranger, no offender, and inform him
KING:
So 'tis our will he should.
Gentleman:
I shall, my liege.
Gentleman:
Exit
KING:
What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?
LAFEU:
All that he is hath reference to your highness.
KING:
Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
KING:
That set him high in fame.
KING:
Enter BERTRAM
LAFEU:
He looks well on't.
KING:
I am not a day of season,
KING:
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
KING:
In me at once: but to the brightest beams
KING:
Distracted clouds give way, so stand thou forth,
KING:
The time is fair again.
BERTRAM:
My high-repented blames,
BERTRAM:
Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
KING:
All is whole,
KING:
Not one word more of the consumed time.
KING:
Let's take the instant by the forward top,
KING:
For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
KING:
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
KING:
Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
KING:
The daughter of this lord?
BERTRAM:
Admiringly, my liege, at first
BERTRAM:
I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
BERTRAM:
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
BERTRAM:
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
BERTRAM:
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
BERTRAM:
Which warp'd the line of every other favour,
BERTRAM:
Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen,
BERTRAM:
Extended or contracted all proportions
BERTRAM:
To a most hideous object: thence it came
BERTRAM:
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
BERTRAM:
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
BERTRAM:
The dust that did offend it.
KING:
Well excused
KING:
That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
KING:
From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
KING:
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
KING:
To the great sender turns a sour offence,
KING:
Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
KING:
Make trivial price of serious things we have,
KING:
Not knowing them until we know their grave
KING:
Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
KING:
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
KING:
Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
KING:
While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
KING:
Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
KING:
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin
KING:
The main consents are had, and here we'll stay
KING:
To see our widower's second marriage-day.
COUNTESS:
Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
COUNTESS:
Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
LAFEU:
Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
LAFEU:
Must be digested, give a favour from you
LAFEU:
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
LAFEU:
That she may quickly come.
LAFEU:
BERTRAM gives a ring
LAFEU:
By my old beard,
LAFEU:
And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,
LAFEU:
Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
LAFEU:
The last that e'er I took her at court,
LAFEU:
I saw upon her finger.
BERTRAM:
Hers it was not.
KING:
Now, pray you, let me see it, for mine eye,
KING:
While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
KING:
This ring was mine, and, when I gave it Helen,
KING:
I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
KING:
Necessitied to help, that by this token
KING:
I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
KING:
her
KING:
Of what should stead her most?
BERTRAM:
My gracious sovereign,
BERTRAM:
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
BERTRAM:
The ring was never hers.
COUNTESS:
Son, on my life,
COUNTESS:
I have seen her wear it, and she reckon'd it
COUNTESS:
At her life's rate.
LAFEU:
I am sure I saw her wear it.
BERTRAM:
You are deceived, my lord, she never saw it
BERTRAM:
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
BERTRAM:
Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
BERTRAM:
Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
BERTRAM:
I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
BERTRAM:
To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
BERTRAM:
I could not answer in that course of honour
BERTRAM:
As she had made the overture, she ceased
BERTRAM:
In heavy satisfaction and would never
BERTRAM:
Receive the ring again.
KING:
Plutus himself,
KING:
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
KING:
Hath not in nature's mystery more science
KING:
Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
KING:
Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
KING:
That you are well acquainted with yourself,
KING:
Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
KING:
You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
KING:
That she would never put it from her finger,
KING:
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
KING:
Where you have never come, or sent it us
KING:
Upon her great disaster.
BERTRAM:
She never saw it.
KING:
Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour,
KING:
And makest conjectural fears to come into me
KING:
Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
KING:
That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so,--
KING:
And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
KING:
And she is dead, which nothing, but to close
KING:
Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
KING:
More than to see this ring. Take him away.
KING:
Guards seize BERTRAM
KING:
My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
KING:
Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
KING:
Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!
KING:
We'll sift this matter further.
BERTRAM:
If you shall prove
BERTRAM:
This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
BERTRAM:
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
BERTRAM:
Where yet she never was.
BERTRAM:
Exit, guarded
KING:
I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.
KING:
Enter a Gentleman
Gentleman:
Gracious sovereign,
Gentleman:
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not
Gentleman:
Here's a petition from a Florentine,
Gentleman:
Who hath for four or five removes come short
Gentleman:
To tender it herself. I undertook it,
Gentleman:
Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
Gentleman:
Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
Gentleman:
Is here attending: her business looks in her
Gentleman:
With an importing visage, and she told me,
Gentleman:
In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
Gentleman:
Your highness with herself.
KING:
[Reads]  Upon his many protestations to marry me
KING:
when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
KING:
me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows
KING:
are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He
KING:
stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
KING:
him to his country for justice: grant it me, O
KING:
king! in you it best lies, otherwise a seducer
KING:
flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
KING:
DIANA CAPILET.
LAFEU:
I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
LAFEU:
this: I'll none of him.
KING:
The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
KING:
To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors
KING:
Go speedily and bring again the count.
KING:
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
KING:
Was foully snatch'd.
COUNTESS:
Now, justice on the doers!
COUNTESS:
Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded
KING:
I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
KING:
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
KING:
Yet you desire to marry.
KING:
Enter Widow and DIANA
KING:
What woman's that?
DIANA:
I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
DIANA:
Derived from the ancient Capilet
DIANA:
My suit, as I do understand, you know,
DIANA:
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
Widow:
I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
Widow:
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
Widow:
And both shall cease, without your remedy.
KING:
Come hither, count, do you know these women?
BERTRAM:
My lord, I neither can nor will deny
BERTRAM:
But that I know them: do they charge me further?
DIANA:
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
BERTRAM:
She's none of mine, my lord.
DIANA:
If you shall marry,
DIANA:
You give away this hand, and that is mine,
DIANA:
You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine,
DIANA:
You give away myself, which is known mine,
DIANA:
For I by vow am so embodied yours,
DIANA:
That she which marries you must marry me,
DIANA:
Either both or none.
LAFEU:
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter, you
LAFEU:
are no husband for her.
BERTRAM:
My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
BERTRAM:
Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness
BERTRAM:
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
BERTRAM:
Than for to think that I would sink it here.
KING:
Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
KING:
Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
KING:
Than in my thought it lies.
DIANA:
Good my lord,
DIANA:
Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
DIANA:
He had not my virginity.
KING:
What say'st thou to her?
BERTRAM:
She's impudent, my lord,
BERTRAM:
And was a common gamester to the camp.
DIANA:
He does me wrong, my lord, if I were so,
DIANA:
He might have bought me at a common price
DIANA:
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
DIANA:
Whose high respect and rich validity
DIANA:
Did lack a parallel, yet for all that
DIANA:
He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
DIANA:
If I be one.
COUNTESS:
He blushes, and 'tis it
COUNTESS:
Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
COUNTESS:
Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
COUNTESS:
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife,
COUNTESS:
That ring's a thousand proofs.
KING:
Methought you said
KING:
You saw one here in court could witness it.
DIANA:
I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
DIANA:
So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.
LAFEU:
I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
KING:
Find him, and bring him hither.
KING:
Exit an Attendant
BERTRAM:
What of him?
BERTRAM:
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
BERTRAM:
With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd,
BERTRAM:
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
BERTRAM:
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
BERTRAM:
That will speak any thing?
KING:
She hath that ring of yours.
BERTRAM:
I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
BERTRAM:
And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth
BERTRAM:
She knew her distance and did angle for me,
BERTRAM:
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
BERTRAM:
As all impediments in fancy's course
BERTRAM:
Are motives of more fancy, and, in fine,
BERTRAM:
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
BERTRAM:
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring,
BERTRAM:
And I had that which any inferior might
BERTRAM:
At market-price have bought.
DIANA:
I must be patient
DIANA:
You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
DIANA:
May justly diet me. I pray you yet,
DIANA:
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband,
DIANA:
Send for your ring, I will return it home,
DIANA:
And give me mine again.
BERTRAM:
I have it not.
KING:
What ring was yours, I pray you?
DIANA:
Sir, much like
DIANA:
The same upon your finger.
KING:
Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
DIANA:
And this was it I gave him, being abed.
KING:
The story then goes false, you threw it him
KING:
Out of a casement.
DIANA:
I have spoke the truth.
DIANA:
Enter PAROLLES
BERTRAM:
My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
KING:
You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
KING:
Is this the man you speak of?
DIANA:
Ay, my lord.
KING:
Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
KING:
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
KING:
Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
KING:
By him and by this woman here what know you?
PAROLLES:
So please your majesty, my master hath been an
PAROLLES:
honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
PAROLLES:
which gentlemen have.
KING:
Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?
PAROLLES:
Faith, sir, he did love her, but how?
KING:
How, I pray you?
PAROLLES:
He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
KING:
How is that?
PAROLLES:
He loved her, sir, and loved her not.
KING:
As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
KING:
equivocal companion is this!
PAROLLES:
I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.
LAFEU:
He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
DIANA:
Do you know he promised me marriage?
PAROLLES:
Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
KING:
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?
PAROLLES:
Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
PAROLLES:
as I said, but more than that, he loved her: for
PAROLLES:
indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
PAROLLES:
of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
PAROLLES:
was in that credit with them at that time that I
PAROLLES:
knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
PAROLLES:
as promising her marriage, and things which would
PAROLLES:
derive me ill will to speak of, therefore I will not
PAROLLES:
speak what I know.
KING:
Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
KING:
they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
KING:
evidence, therefore stand aside.
KING:
This ring, you say, was yours?
DIANA:
Ay, my good lord.
KING:
Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?
DIANA:
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
KING:
Who lent it you?
DIANA:
It was not lent me neither.
KING:
Where did you find it, then?
DIANA:
I found it not.
KING:
If it were yours by none of all these ways,
KING:
How could you give it him?
DIANA:
I never gave it him.
LAFEU:
This woman's an easy glove, my lord, she goes off
LAFEU:
and on at pleasure.
KING:
This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.
DIANA:
It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
KING:
Take her away, I do not like her now,
KING:
To prison with her: and away with him.
KING:
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
KING:
Thou diest within this hour.
DIANA:
I'll never tell you.
KING:
Take her away.
DIANA:
I'll put in bail, my liege.
KING:
I think thee now some common customer.
DIANA:
By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
KING:
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?
DIANA:
Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty
DIANA:
He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't,
DIANA:
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
DIANA:
Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life,
DIANA:
I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
KING:
She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.
DIANA:
Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir
DIANA:
Exit Widow
DIANA:
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
DIANA:
And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
DIANA:
Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
DIANA:
Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him
DIANA:
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled,
DIANA:
And at that time he got his wife with child
DIANA:
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick
DIANA:
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick
DIANA:
And now behold the meaning.
DIANA:
Re-enter Widow, with HELENA
KING:
Is there no exorcist
KING:
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
KING:
Is't real that I see?
HELENA:
No, my good lord,
HELENA:
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
HELENA:
The name and not the thing.
BERTRAM:
Both, both. O, pardon!
HELENA:
O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
HELENA:
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,
HELENA:
And, look you, here's your letter, this it says
HELENA:
'When from my finger you can get this ring
HELENA:
And are by me with child,'  and c. This is done
HELENA:
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?
BERTRAM:
If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
BERTRAM:
I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
HELENA:
If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
HELENA:
Deadly divorce step between me and you!
HELENA:
O my dear mother, do I see you living?
LAFEU:
Mine eyes smell onions, I shall weep anon
LAFEU:
To PAROLLES
LAFEU:
Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
LAFEU:
I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee
LAFEU:
Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.
KING:
Let us from point to point this story know,
KING:
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
KING:
To DIANA
KING:
If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
KING:
Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower,
KING:
For I can guess that by thy honest aid
KING:
Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
KING:
Of that and all the progress, more or less,
KING:
Resolvedly more leisure shall express
KING:
All yet seems well, and if it end so meet,
KING:
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
KING:
Flourish
KING:
EPILOGUE
KING:
The king's a beggar, now the play is done
KING:
All is well ended, if this suit be won,
KING:
That you express content, which we will pay,
KING:
With strife to please you, day exceeding day
KING:
Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts,
KING:
Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
KING:
Exeunt
