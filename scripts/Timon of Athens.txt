PROSPERO:
ACT I
PROSPERO:
SCENE I. Athens. A hall in Timon's house.
PROSPERO:
Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and others, at several doors
Poet:
Good day, sir.
Painter:
I am glad you're well.
Poet:
I have not seen you long: how goes the world?
Painter:
It wears, sir, as it grows.
Poet:
Ay, that's well known
Poet:
But what particular rarity? what strange,
Poet:
Which manifold record not matches? See,
Poet:
Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
Poet:
Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.
Painter:
I know them both, th' other's a jeweller.
Merchant:
O, 'tis a worthy lord.
Jeweller:
Nay, that's most fix'd.
Merchant:
A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
Merchant:
To an untirable and continuate goodness
Merchant:
He passes.
Merchant:
Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--
Merchant:
O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
Merchant:
Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--
Poet:
[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have
Poet:
praised the vile,
Poet:
It stains the glory in that happy verse
Poet:
Which aptly sings the good.'
Merchant:
'Tis a good form.
Merchant:
Looking at the jewel
Jeweller:
And rich: here is a water, look ye.
Painter:
You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
Painter:
To the great lord.
Poet:
A thing slipp'd idly from me.
Poet:
Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
Poet:
From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
Poet:
Shows not till it be struck, our gentle flame
Poet:
Provokes itself and like the current flies
Poet:
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
Painter:
A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?
Poet:
Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
Poet:
Let's see your piece.
Painter:
'Tis a good piece.
Poet:
So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.
Painter:
Indifferent.
Poet:
Admirable: how this grace
Poet:
Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
Poet:
This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
Poet:
Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
Poet:
One might interpret.
Painter:
It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Painter:
Here is a touch, is't good?
Poet:
I will say of it,
Poet:
It tutors nature: artificial strife
Poet:
Lives in these touches, livelier than life.
Poet:
Enter certain Senators, and pass over
Painter:
How this lord is follow'd!
Poet:
The senators of Athens: happy man!
Painter:
Look, more!
Poet:
You see this confluence, this great flood
Poet:
of visitors.
Poet:
I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
Poet:
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
Poet:
With amplest entertainment: my free drift
Poet:
Halts not particularly, but moves itself
Poet:
In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
Poet:
Infects one comma in the course I hold,
Poet:
But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
Poet:
Leaving no tract behind.
Painter:
How shall I understand you?
Poet:
I will unbolt to you.
Poet:
You see how all conditions, how all minds,
Poet:
As well of glib and slippery creatures as
Poet:
Of grave and austere quality, tender down
Poet:
Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
Poet:
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
Poet:
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
Poet:
All sorts of hearts, yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
Poet:
To Apemantus, that few things loves better
Poet:
Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
Poet:
The knee before him, and returns in peace
Poet:
Most rich in Timon's nod.
Painter:
I saw them speak together.
Poet:
Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
Poet:
Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
Poet:
Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
Poet:
That labour on the bosom of this sphere
Poet:
To propagate their states: amongst them all,
Poet:
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,
Poet:
One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
Poet:
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,
Poet:
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Poet:
Translates his rivals.
Painter:
'Tis conceived to scope.
Painter:
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
Painter:
With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
Painter:
Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
Painter:
To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
Painter:
In our condition.
Poet:
Nay, sir, but hear me on.
Poet:
All those which were his fellows but of late,
Poet:
Some better than his value, on the moment
Poet:
Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
Poet:
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
Poet:
Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
Poet:
Drink the free air.
Painter:
Ay, marry, what of these?
Poet:
When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Poet:
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants
Poet:
Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
Poet:
Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
Poet:
Not one accompanying his declining foot.
Painter:
'Tis common
Painter:
A thousand moral paintings I can show
Painter:
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
Painter:
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
Painter:
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
Painter:
The foot above the head.
Painter:
Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself  courteously to every suitor, a Messenger from  VENTIDIUS talking with him, LUCILIUS and other servants following
TIMON:
Imprison'd is he, say you?
Messenger:
Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
Messenger:
His means most short, his creditors most strait
Messenger:
Your honourable letter he desires
Messenger:
To those have shut him up, which failing,
Messenger:
Periods his comfort.
TIMON:
Noble Ventidius! Well,
TIMON:
I am not of that feather to shake off
TIMON:
My friend when he must need me. I do know him
TIMON:
A gentleman that well deserves a help
TIMON:
Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,
TIMON:
and free him.
Messenger:
Your lordship ever binds him.
TIMON:
Commend me to him: I will send his ransom,
TIMON:
And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
TIMON:
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
TIMON:
But to support him after. Fare you well.
Messenger:
All happiness to your honour!
Messenger:
Exit
Messenger:
Enter an old Athenian
Old Athenian:
Lord Timon, hear me speak.
TIMON:
Freely, good father.
Old Athenian:
Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.
TIMON:
I have so: what of him?
Old Athenian:
Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
TIMON:
Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!
LUCILIUS:
Here, at your lordship's service.
Old Athenian:
This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
Old Athenian:
By night frequents my house. I am a man
Old Athenian:
That from my first have been inclined to thrift,
Old Athenian:
And my estate deserves an heir more raised
Old Athenian:
Than one which holds a trencher.
TIMON:
Well, what further?
Old Athenian:
One only daughter have I, no kin else,
Old Athenian:
On whom I may confer what I have got
Old Athenian:
The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
Old Athenian:
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
Old Athenian:
In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Old Athenian:
Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
Old Athenian:
Join with me to forbid him her resort,
Old Athenian:
Myself have spoke in vain.
TIMON:
The man is honest.
Old Athenian:
Therefore he will be, Timon
Old Athenian:
His honesty rewards him in itself,
Old Athenian:
It must not bear my daughter.
TIMON:
Does she love him?
Old Athenian:
She is young and apt
Old Athenian:
Our own precedent passions do instruct us
Old Athenian:
What levity's in youth.
TIMON:
[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?
LUCILIUS:
Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
Old Athenian:
If in her marriage my consent be missing,
Old Athenian:
I call the gods to witness, I will choose
Old Athenian:
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
Old Athenian:
And dispossess her all.
TIMON:
How shall she be endow'd,
TIMON:
if she be mated with an equal husband?
Old Athenian:
Three talents on the present, in future, all.
TIMON:
This gentleman of mine hath served me long
TIMON:
To build his fortune I will strain a little,
TIMON:
For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter
TIMON:
What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
TIMON:
And make him weigh with her.
Old Athenian:
Most noble lord,
Old Athenian:
Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
TIMON:
My hand to thee, mine honour on my promise.
LUCILIUS:
Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
LUCILIUS:
The state or fortune fall into my keeping,
LUCILIUS:
Which is not owed to you!
LUCILIUS:
Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian
Poet:
Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!
TIMON:
I thank you, you shall hear from me anon
TIMON:
Go not away. What have you there, my friend?
Painter:
A piece of painting, which I do beseech
Painter:
Your lordship to accept.
TIMON:
Painting is welcome.
TIMON:
The painting is almost the natural man,
TIMON:
or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
TIMON:
He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
TIMON:
Even such as they give out. I like your work,
TIMON:
And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
TIMON:
Till you hear further from me.
Painter:
The gods preserve ye!
TIMON:
Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand,
TIMON:
We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
TIMON:
Hath suffer'd under praise.
Jeweller:
What, my lord! dispraise?
TIMON:
A more satiety of commendations.
TIMON:
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
TIMON:
It would unclew me quite.
Jeweller:
My lord, 'tis rated
Jeweller:
As those which sell would give: but you well know,
Jeweller:
Things of like value differing in the owners
Jeweller:
Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
Jeweller:
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
TIMON:
Well mock'd.
Merchant:
No, my good lord, he speaks the common tongue,
Merchant:
Which all men speak with him.
TIMON:
Look, who comes here: will you be chid?
TIMON:
Enter APEMANTUS
TIMON:
Jeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship.
Merchant:
He'll spare none.
TIMON:
Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
APEMANTUS:
Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow,
APEMANTUS:
When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.
TIMON:
Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.
APEMANTUS:
Are they not Athenians?
TIMON:
Yes.
APEMANTUS:
Then I repent not.
APEMANTUS:
Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
TIMON:
Thou art proud, Apemantus.
APEMANTUS:
Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
TIMON:
Whither art going?
APEMANTUS:
To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
TIMON:
That's a deed thou'lt die for.
APEMANTUS:
Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.
TIMON:
How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
The best, for the innocence.
TIMON:
Wrought he not well that painted it?
APEMANTUS:
He wrought better that made the painter, and yet
APEMANTUS:
he's but a filthy piece of work.
Painter:
You're a dog.
APEMANTUS:
Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?
TIMON:
Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
No, I eat not lords.
TIMON:
An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.
APEMANTUS:
O, they eat lords, so they come by great bellies.
TIMON:
That's a lascivious apprehension.
APEMANTUS:
So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.
TIMON:
How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a
APEMANTUS:
man a doit.
TIMON:
What dost thou think 'tis worth?
APEMANTUS:
Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
Poet:
How now, philosopher!
APEMANTUS:
Thou liest.
Poet:
Art not one?
APEMANTUS:
Yes.
Poet:
Then I lie not.
APEMANTUS:
Art not a poet?
Poet:
Yes.
APEMANTUS:
Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou
APEMANTUS:
hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
Poet:
That's not feigned, he is so.
APEMANTUS:
Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
APEMANTUS:
labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
APEMANTUS:
the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!
TIMON:
What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
E'en as Apemantus does now, hate a lord with my heart.
TIMON:
What, thyself?
APEMANTUS:
Ay.
TIMON:
Wherefore?
APEMANTUS:
That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
APEMANTUS:
Art not thou a merchant?
Merchant:
Ay, Apemantus.
APEMANTUS:
Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
Merchant:
If traffic do it, the gods do it.
APEMANTUS:
Traffic's thy god, and thy god confound thee!
APEMANTUS:
Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger
TIMON:
What trumpet's that?
Messenger:
'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
Messenger:
All of companionship.
TIMON:
Pray, entertain them, give them guide to us.
TIMON:
Exeunt some Attendants
TIMON:
You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
TIMON:
Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,
TIMON:
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
TIMON:
Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest
TIMON:
Most welcome, sir!
APEMANTUS:
So, so, there!
APEMANTUS:
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
APEMANTUS:
That there should be small love 'mongst these
APEMANTUS:
sweet knaves,
APEMANTUS:
And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
APEMANTUS:
Into baboon and monkey.
ALCIBIADES:
Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed
ALCIBIADES:
Most hungerly on your sight.
TIMON:
Right welcome, sir!
TIMON:
Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time
TIMON:
In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.
TIMON:
Exeunt all except APEMANTUS
TIMON:
Enter two Lords
First Lord:
What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Time to be honest.
First Lord:
That time serves still.
APEMANTUS:
The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.
Second Lord:
Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
APEMANTUS:
Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
Second Lord:
Fare thee well, fare thee well.
APEMANTUS:
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
Second Lord:
Why, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to
APEMANTUS:
give thee none.
First Lord:
Hang thyself!
APEMANTUS:
No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy
APEMANTUS:
requests to thy friend.
Second Lord:
Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!
APEMANTUS:
I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.
APEMANTUS:
Exit
First Lord:
He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
First Lord:
And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
First Lord:
The very heart of kindness.
Second Lord:
He pours it out, Plutus, the god of gold,
Second Lord:
Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays
Second Lord:
Sevenfold above itself, no gift to him,
Second Lord:
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
Second Lord:
All use of quittance.
First Lord:
The noblest mind he carries
First Lord:
That ever govern'd man.
Second Lord:
Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
First Lord:
I'll keep you company.
First Lord:
Exeunt
First Lord:
SCENE II. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.
First Lord:
Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet  served in, FLAVIUS and others attending, then enter  TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.  Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself
VENTIDIUS:
Most honour'd Timon,
VENTIDIUS:
It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,
VENTIDIUS:
And call him to long peace.
VENTIDIUS:
He is gone happy, and has left me rich
VENTIDIUS:
Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
VENTIDIUS:
To your free heart, I do return those talents,
VENTIDIUS:
Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
VENTIDIUS:
I derived liberty.
TIMON:
O, by no means,
TIMON:
Honest Ventidius, you mistake my love
TIMON:
I gave it freely ever, and there's none
TIMON:
Can truly say he gives, if he receives
TIMON:
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
TIMON:
To imitate them, faults that are rich are fair.
VENTIDIUS:
A noble spirit!
TIMON:
Nay, my lords,
TIMON:
They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON
TIMON:
Ceremony was but devised at first
TIMON:
To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
TIMON:
Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown,
TIMON:
But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
TIMON:
Pray, sit, more welcome are ye to my fortunes
TIMON:
Than my fortunes to me.
TIMON:
They sit
First Lord:
My lord, we always have confess'd it.
APEMANTUS:
Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?
TIMON:
O, Apemantus, you are welcome.
APEMANTUS:
No,
APEMANTUS:
You shall not make me welcome
APEMANTUS:
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
TIMON:
Fie, thou'rt a churl, ye've got a humour there
TIMON:
Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
TIMON:
They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est,' but yond
TIMON:
man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by
TIMON:
himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
TIMON:
he fit for't, indeed.
APEMANTUS:
Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to
APEMANTUS:
observe, I give thee warning on't.
TIMON:
I take no heed of thee, thou'rt an Athenian,
TIMON:
therefore welcome: I myself would have no power,
TIMON:
prithee, let my meat make thee silent.
APEMANTUS:
I scorn thy meat, 'twould choke me, for I should
APEMANTUS:
ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
APEMANTUS:
men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me
APEMANTUS:
to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood,
APEMANTUS:
and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
APEMANTUS:
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men
APEMANTUS:
Methinks they should invite them without knives,
APEMANTUS:
Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
APEMANTUS:
There's much example for't, the fellow that sits
APEMANTUS:
next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
APEMANTUS:
breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
APEMANTUS:
man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
APEMANTUS:
huge man, I should fear to drink at meals,
APEMANTUS:
Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes
APEMANTUS:
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
TIMON:
My lord, in heart, and let the health go round.
Second Lord:
Let it flow this way, my good lord.
APEMANTUS:
Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides
APEMANTUS:
well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
APEMANTUS:
look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to
APEMANTUS:
be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire
APEMANTUS:
This and my food are equals, there's no odds
APEMANTUS:
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
APEMANTUS:
Apemantus' grace.
APEMANTUS:
Immortal gods, I crave no pelf,
APEMANTUS:
I pray for no man but myself
APEMANTUS:
Grant I may never prove so fond,
APEMANTUS:
To trust man on his oath or bond,
APEMANTUS:
Or a harlot, for her weeping,
APEMANTUS:
Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping
APEMANTUS:
Or a keeper with my freedom,
APEMANTUS:
Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
APEMANTUS:
Amen. So fall to't
APEMANTUS:
Rich men sin, and I eat root.
APEMANTUS:
Eats and drinks
APEMANTUS:
Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!
TIMON:
Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.
ALCIBIADES:
My heart is ever at your service, my lord.
TIMON:
You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
TIMON:
dinner of friends.
ALCIBIADES:
So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat
ALCIBIADES:
like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.
APEMANTUS:
Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,
APEMANTUS:
that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!
First Lord:
Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
First Lord:
would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
First Lord:
some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
First Lord:
for ever perfect.
TIMON:
O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
TIMON:
themselves have provided that I shall have much help
TIMON:
from you: how had you been my friends else? why
TIMON:
have you that charitable title from thousands, did
TIMON:
not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
TIMON:
more of you to myself than you can with modesty
TIMON:
speak in your own behalf, and thus far I confirm
TIMON:
you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
TIMON:
friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they
TIMON:
were the most needless creatures living, should we
TIMON:
ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble
TIMON:
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
TIMON:
sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
TIMON:
myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
TIMON:
are born to do benefits: and what better or
TIMON:
properer can we can our own than the riches of our
TIMON:
friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have
TIMON:
so many, like brothers, commanding one another's
TIMON:
fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!
TIMON:
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
TIMON:
forget their faults, I drink to you.
APEMANTUS:
Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.
Second Lord:
Joy had the like conception in our eyes
Second Lord:
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
APEMANTUS:
Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
Third Lord:
I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.
APEMANTUS:
Much!
APEMANTUS:
Tucket, within
TIMON:
What means that trump?
TIMON:
Enter a Servant
TIMON:
How now?
Servant:
Please you, my lord, there are certain
Servant:
ladies most desirous of admittance.
TIMON:
Ladies! what are their wills?
Servant:
There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which
Servant:
bears that office, to signify their pleasures.
TIMON:
I pray, let them be admitted.
TIMON:
Enter Cupid
Cupid:
Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all
Cupid:
That of his bounties taste! The five best senses
Cupid:
Acknowledge thee their patron, and come freely
Cupid:
To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,
Cupid:
Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise,
Cupid:
They only now come but to feast thine eyes.
TIMON:
They're welcome all, let 'em have kind admittance
TIMON:
Music, make their welcome!
TIMON:
Exit Cupid
First Lord:
You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.
First Lord:
Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies  as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing
APEMANTUS:
Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
APEMANTUS:
They dance! they are mad women.
APEMANTUS:
Like madness is the glory of this life.
APEMANTUS:
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
APEMANTUS:
We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves,
APEMANTUS:
And spend our flatteries, to drink those men
APEMANTUS:
Upon whose age we void it up again,
APEMANTUS:
With poisonous spite and envy.
APEMANTUS:
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
APEMANTUS:
Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
APEMANTUS:
Of their friends' gift?
APEMANTUS:
I should fear those that dance before me now
APEMANTUS:
Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done,
APEMANTUS:
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
APEMANTUS:
The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of  TIMON, and to show their loves, each singles out an  Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease
TIMON:
You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
TIMON:
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
TIMON:
Which was not half so beautiful and kind,
TIMON:
You have added worth unto 't and lustre,
TIMON:
And entertain'd me with mine own device,
TIMON:
I am to thank you for 't.
First Lady:
My lord, you take us even at the best.
APEMANTUS:
'Faith, for the worst is filthy, and would not hold
APEMANTUS:
taking, I doubt me.
TIMON:
Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you
TIMON:
Please you to dispose yourselves.
All Ladies:
Most thankfully, my lord.
All Ladies:
Exeunt Cupid and Ladies
TIMON:
Flavius.
FLAVIUS:
My lord?
TIMON:
The little casket bring me hither.
FLAVIUS:
Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!
FLAVIUS:
There is no crossing him in 's humour,
FLAVIUS:
Aside
FLAVIUS:
Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
FLAVIUS:
When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.
FLAVIUS:
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
FLAVIUS:
That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.
FLAVIUS:
Exit
First Lord:
Where be our men?
Servant:
Here, my lord, in readiness.
Second Lord:
Our horses!
Second Lord:
Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket
TIMON:
O my friends,
TIMON:
I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,
TIMON:
I must entreat you, honour me so much
TIMON:
As to advance this jewel, accept it and wear it,
TIMON:
Kind my lord.
First Lord:
I am so far already in your gifts,--
All:
So are we all.
All:
Enter a Servant
Servant:
My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate
Servant:
Newly alighted, and come to visit you.
TIMON:
They are fairly welcome.
FLAVIUS:
I beseech your honour,
FLAVIUS:
Vouchsafe me a word, it does concern you near.
TIMON:
Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee
TIMON:
I prithee, let's be provided to show them
TIMON:
entertainment.
FLAVIUS:
[Aside]  I scarce know how.
FLAVIUS:
Enter a Second Servant
Second Servant:
May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,
Second Servant:
Out of his free love, hath presented to you
Second Servant:
Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.
TIMON:
I shall accept them fairly, let the presents
TIMON:
Be worthily entertain'd.
TIMON:
Enter a third Servant
TIMON:
How now! what news?
Third Servant:
Please you, my lord, that honourable
Third Servant:
gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company
Third Servant:
to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour
Third Servant:
two brace of greyhounds.
TIMON:
I'll hunt with him, and let them be received,
TIMON:
Not without fair reward.
FLAVIUS:
[Aside]                What will this come to?
FLAVIUS:
He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,
FLAVIUS:
And all out of an empty coffer
FLAVIUS:
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
FLAVIUS:
To show him what a beggar his heart is,
FLAVIUS:
Being of no power to make his wishes good
FLAVIUS:
His promises fly so beyond his state
FLAVIUS:
That what he speaks is all in debt, he owes
FLAVIUS:
For every word: he is so kind that he now
FLAVIUS:
Pays interest for 't, his land's put to their books.
FLAVIUS:
Well, would I were gently put out of office
FLAVIUS:
Before I were forced out!
FLAVIUS:
Happier is he that has no friend to feed
FLAVIUS:
Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
FLAVIUS:
I bleed inwardly for my lord.
FLAVIUS:
Exit
TIMON:
You do yourselves
TIMON:
Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits
TIMON:
Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.
Second Lord:
With more than common thanks I will receive it.
Third Lord:
O, he's the very soul of bounty!
TIMON:
And now I remember, my lord, you gave
TIMON:
Good words the other day of a bay courser
TIMON:
I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.
Second Lord:
O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.
TIMON:
You may take my word, my lord, I know, no man
TIMON:
Can justly praise but what he does affect
TIMON:
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own,
TIMON:
I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.
All Lords:
O, none so welcome.
TIMON:
I take all and your several visitations
TIMON:
So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give,
TIMON:
Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
TIMON:
And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
TIMON:
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich,
TIMON:
It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living
TIMON:
Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
TIMON:
Lie in a pitch'd field.
ALCIBIADES:
Ay, defiled land, my lord.
First Lord:
We are so virtuously bound--
TIMON:
And so
TIMON:
Am I to you.
Second Lord:
So infinitely endear'd--
TIMON:
All to you. Lights, more lights!
First Lord:
The best of happiness,
First Lord:
Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!
TIMON:
Ready for his friends.
TIMON:
Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON
APEMANTUS:
What a coil's here!
APEMANTUS:
Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
APEMANTUS:
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
APEMANTUS:
That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs
APEMANTUS:
Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,
APEMANTUS:
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.
TIMON:
Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be
TIMON:
good to thee.
APEMANTUS:
No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,
APEMANTUS:
there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then
APEMANTUS:
thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,
APEMANTUS:
Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
APEMANTUS:
paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and
APEMANTUS:
vain-glories?
TIMON:
Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am
TIMON:
sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell, and come
TIMON:
with better music.
TIMON:
Exit
APEMANTUS:
So
APEMANTUS:
Thou wilt not hear me now, thou shalt not then
APEMANTUS:
I'll lock thy heaven from thee.
APEMANTUS:
O, that men's ears should be
APEMANTUS:
To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!
APEMANTUS:
Exit
APEMANTUS:
ACT II
APEMANTUS:
SCENE I. A Senator's house.
APEMANTUS:
Enter Senator, with papers in his hand
Senator:
And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore
Senator:
He owes nine thousand, besides my former sum,
Senator:
Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
Senator:
Of raging waste? It cannot hold, it will not.
Senator:
If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,
Senator:
And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
Senator:
If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more
Senator:
Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
Senator:
Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,
Senator:
And able horses. No porter at his gate,
Senator:
But rather one that smiles and still invites
Senator:
All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason
Senator:
Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
Senator:
Caphis, I say!
Senator:
Enter CAPHIS
CAPHIS:
Here, sir, what is your pleasure?
Senator:
Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon,
Senator:
Importune him for my moneys, be not ceased
Senator:
With slight denial, nor then silenced when--
Senator:
'Commend me to your master'--and the cap
Senator:
Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,
Senator:
My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
Senator:
Out of mine own, his days and times are past
Senator:
And my reliances on his fracted dates
Senator:
Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,
Senator:
But must not break my back to heal his finger,
Senator:
Immediate are my needs, and my relief
Senator:
Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
Senator:
But find supply immediate. Get you gone
Senator:
Put on a most importunate aspect,
Senator:
A visage of demand, for, I do fear,
Senator:
When every feather sticks in his own wing,
Senator:
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
Senator:
Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.
CAPHIS:
I go, sir.
Senator:
'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,
Senator:
And have the dates in contempt.
CAPHIS:
I will, sir.
Senator:
Go.
Senator:
Exeunt
Senator:
SCENE II. The same. A hall in Timon's house.
Senator:
Enter FLAVIUS, with many bills in his hand
FLAVIUS:
No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
FLAVIUS:
That he will neither know how to maintain it,
FLAVIUS:
Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account
FLAVIUS:
How things go from him, nor resumes no care
FLAVIUS:
Of what is to continue: never mind
FLAVIUS:
Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.
FLAVIUS:
What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel
FLAVIUS:
I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.
FLAVIUS:
Fie, fie, fie, fie!
FLAVIUS:
Enter CAPHIS, and the Servants of Isidore and Varro
CAPHIS:
Good even, Varro: what,
CAPHIS:
You come for money?
CAPHIS:
Varro's Servant	Is't not your business too?
CAPHIS:
It is: and yours too, Isidore?
CAPHIS:
Isidore's Servant	It is so.
CAPHIS:
Would we were all discharged!
CAPHIS:
Varro's Servant	I fear it.
CAPHIS:
Here comes the lord.
CAPHIS:
Enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, and Lords,  and c
TIMON:
So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,
TIMON:
My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?
CAPHIS:
My lord, here is a note of certain dues.
TIMON:
Dues! Whence are you?
CAPHIS:
Of Athens here, my lord.
TIMON:
Go to my steward.
CAPHIS:
Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
CAPHIS:
To the succession of new days this month
CAPHIS:
My master is awaked by great occasion
CAPHIS:
To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
CAPHIS:
That with your other noble parts you'll suit
CAPHIS:
In giving him his right.
TIMON:
Mine honest friend,
TIMON:
I prithee, but repair to me next morning.
CAPHIS:
Nay, good my lord,--
TIMON:
Contain thyself, good friend.
TIMON:
Varro's Servant	One Varro's servant, my good lord,--
TIMON:
Isidore's Servant	From Isidore,
TIMON:
He humbly prays your speedy payment.
CAPHIS:
If you did know, my lord, my master's wants--
CAPHIS:
Varro's Servant	'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks And past.
CAPHIS:
Isidore's Servant	         Your steward puts me off, my lord,
CAPHIS:
And I am sent expressly to your lordship.
TIMON:
Give me breath.
TIMON:
I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on,
TIMON:
I'll wait upon you instantly.
TIMON:
Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords
TIMON:
To FLAVIUS
TIMON:
Come hither: pray you,
TIMON:
How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd
TIMON:
With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,
TIMON:
And the detention of long-since-due debts,
TIMON:
Against my honour?
FLAVIUS:
Please you, gentlemen,
FLAVIUS:
The time is unagreeable to this business
FLAVIUS:
Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
FLAVIUS:
That I may make his lordship understand
FLAVIUS:
Wherefore you are not paid.
TIMON:
Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd.
TIMON:
Exit
FLAVIUS:
Pray, draw near.
FLAVIUS:
Exit
FLAVIUS:
Enter APEMANTUS and Fool
CAPHIS:
Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus
CAPHIS:
let's ha' some sport with 'em.
CAPHIS:
Varro's Servant	Hang him, he'll abuse us.
CAPHIS:
Isidore's Servant	A plague upon him, dog!
CAPHIS:
Varro's Servant	How dost, fool?
APEMANTUS:
Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
APEMANTUS:
Varro's Servant	I speak not to thee.
APEMANTUS:
No,'tis to thyself.
APEMANTUS:
To the Fool
APEMANTUS:
Come away.
APEMANTUS:
Isidore's Servant	There's the fool hangs on your back already.
APEMANTUS:
No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.
CAPHIS:
Where's the fool now?
APEMANTUS:
He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and
APEMANTUS:
usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
All Servants:
What are we, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Asses.
All Servants:
Why?
APEMANTUS:
That you ask me what you are, and do not know
APEMANTUS:
yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.
Fool:
How do you, gentlemen?
All Servants:
Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?
Fool:
She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens
Fool:
as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
APEMANTUS:
Good! gramercy.
APEMANTUS:
Enter Page
Fool:
Look you, here comes my mistress' page.
Page:
[To the Fool]  Why, how now, captain! what do you
Page:
in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer
APEMANTUS:
thee profitably.
Page:
Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of
Page:
these letters: I know not which is which.
APEMANTUS:
Canst not read?
Page:
No.
APEMANTUS:
There will little learning die then, that day thou
APEMANTUS:
art hanged. This is to Lord Timon, this to
APEMANTUS:
Alcibiades. Go, thou wast born a bastard, and thou't
APEMANTUS:
die a bawd.
Page:
Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a
Page:
dog's death. Answer not, I am gone.
Page:
Exit
APEMANTUS:
E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool, I will go with
APEMANTUS:
you to Lord Timon's.
Fool:
Will you leave me there?
APEMANTUS:
If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
All Servants:
Ay, would they served us!
APEMANTUS:
So would I,--as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.
Fool:
Are you three usurers' men?
All Servants:
Ay, fool.
Fool:
I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my
Fool:
mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come
Fool:
to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and
Fool:
go away merry, but they enter my mistress' house
Fool:
merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?
Fool:
Varro's Servant	I could render one.
APEMANTUS:
Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster
APEMANTUS:
and a knave, which not-withstanding, thou shalt be
APEMANTUS:
no less esteemed.
APEMANTUS:
Varro's Servant	What is a whoremaster, fool?
Fool:
A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.
Fool:
'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord,
Fool:
sometime like a lawyer, sometime like a philosopher,
Fool:
with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is
Fool:
very often like a knight, and, generally, in all
Fool:
shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore
Fool:
to thirteen, this spirit walks in.
Fool:
Varro's Servant	Thou art not altogether a fool.
Fool:
Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as
Fool:
I have, so much wit thou lackest.
APEMANTUS:
That answer might have become Apemantus.
All Servants:
Aside, aside, here comes Lord Timon.
All Servants:
Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS
APEMANTUS:
Come with me, fool, come.
Fool:
I do not always follow lover, elder brother and
Fool:
woman, sometime the philosopher.
Fool:
Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool
FLAVIUS:
Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.
FLAVIUS:
Exeunt Servants
TIMON:
You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time
TIMON:
Had you not fully laid my state before me,
TIMON:
That I might so have rated my expense,
TIMON:
As I had leave of means?
FLAVIUS:
You would not hear me,
FLAVIUS:
At many leisures I proposed.
TIMON:
Go to
TIMON:
Perchance some single vantages you took.
TIMON:
When my indispos ition put you back
TIMON:
And that unaptness made your minister,
TIMON:
Thus to excuse yourself.
FLAVIUS:
O my good lord,
FLAVIUS:
At many times I brought in my accounts,
FLAVIUS:
Laid them before you, you would throw them off,
FLAVIUS:
And say, you found them in mine honesty.
FLAVIUS:
When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
FLAVIUS:
Return so much, I have shook my head and wept,
FLAVIUS:
Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
FLAVIUS:
To hold your hand more close: I did endure
FLAVIUS:
Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have
FLAVIUS:
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
FLAVIUS:
And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
FLAVIUS:
Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--
FLAVIUS:
The greatest of your having lacks a half
FLAVIUS:
To pay your present debts.
TIMON:
Let all my land be sold.
FLAVIUS:
'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone,
FLAVIUS:
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
FLAVIUS:
Of present dues: the future comes apace
FLAVIUS:
What shall defend the interim? and at length
FLAVIUS:
How goes our reckoning?
TIMON:
To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
FLAVIUS:
O my good lord, the world is but a word
FLAVIUS:
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
FLAVIUS:
How quickly were it gone!
TIMON:
You tell me true.
FLAVIUS:
If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
FLAVIUS:
Call me before the exactest auditors
FLAVIUS:
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
FLAVIUS:
When all our offices have been oppress'd
FLAVIUS:
With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
FLAVIUS:
With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
FLAVIUS:
Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
FLAVIUS:
I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
FLAVIUS:
And set mine eyes at flow.
TIMON:
Prithee, no more.
FLAVIUS:
Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!
FLAVIUS:
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
FLAVIUS:
This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
FLAVIUS:
What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is
FLAVIUS:
Lord Timon's?
FLAVIUS:
Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!
FLAVIUS:
Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
FLAVIUS:
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made
FLAVIUS:
Feast-won, fast-lost, one cloud of winter showers,
FLAVIUS:
These flies are couch'd.
TIMON:
Come, sermon me no further
TIMON:
No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart,
TIMON:
Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
TIMON:
Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,
TIMON:
To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart,
TIMON:
If I would broach the vessels of my love,
TIMON:
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
TIMON:
Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
TIMON:
As I can bid thee speak.
FLAVIUS:
Assurance bless your thoughts!
TIMON:
And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,
TIMON:
That I account them blessings, for by these
TIMON:
Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
TIMON:
Mistake my fortunes, I am wealthy in my friends.
TIMON:
Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!
TIMON:
Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other Servants
Servants:
My lord? my lord?
TIMON:
I will dispatch you severally, you to Lord Lucius,
TIMON:
to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour
TIMON:
to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their
TIMON:
loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have
TIMON:
found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let
TIMON:
the request be fifty talents.
FLAMINIUS:
As you have said, my lord.
FLAVIUS:
[Aside]  Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!
TIMON:
Go you, sir, to the senators--
TIMON:
Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have
TIMON:
Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant
TIMON:
A thousand talents to me.
FLAVIUS:
I have been bold--
FLAVIUS:
For that I knew it the most general way--
FLAVIUS:
To them to use your signet and your name,
FLAVIUS:
But they do shake their heads, and I am here
FLAVIUS:
No richer in return.
TIMON:
Is't true? can't be?
FLAVIUS:
They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,
FLAVIUS:
That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
FLAVIUS:
Do what they would, are sorry--you are honourable,--
FLAVIUS:
But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--
FLAVIUS:
Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
FLAVIUS:
May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity,--
FLAVIUS:
And so, intending other serious matters,
FLAVIUS:
After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,
FLAVIUS:
With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
FLAVIUS:
They froze me into silence.
TIMON:
You gods, reward them!
TIMON:
Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
TIMON:
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary
TIMON:
Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows,
TIMON:
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind,
TIMON:
And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
TIMON:
Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.
TIMON:
To a Servant
TIMON:
Go to Ventidius.
TIMON:
To FLAVIUS
TIMON:
Prithee, be not sad,
TIMON:
Thou art true and honest, ingeniously I speak.
TIMON:
No blame belongs to thee.
TIMON:
To Servant
TIMON:
Ventidius lately
TIMON:
Buried his father, by whose death he's stepp'd
TIMON:
Into a great estate: when he was poor,
TIMON:
Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,
TIMON:
I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me,
TIMON:
Bid him suppose some good necessity
TIMON:
Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd
TIMON:
With those five talents.
TIMON:
Exit Servant
TIMON:
To FLAVIUS
TIMON:
That had, give't these fellows
TIMON:
To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,
TIMON:
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.
FLAVIUS:
I would I could not think it: that thought is
FLAVIUS:
bounty's foe,
FLAVIUS:
Being free itself, it thinks all others so.
FLAVIUS:
Exeunt
FLAVIUS:
ACT III
FLAVIUS:
SCENE I. A room in Lucullus' house.
FLAVIUS:
FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him
Servant:
I have told my lord of you, he is coming down to you.
FLAMINIUS:
I thank you, sir.
FLAMINIUS:
Enter LUCULLUS
Servant:
Here's my lord.
LUCULLUS:
[Aside]  One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I
LUCULLUS:
warrant. Why, this hits right, I dreamt of a silver
LUCULLUS:
basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest
LUCULLUS:
Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome, sir.
LUCULLUS:
Fill me some wine.
LUCULLUS:
Exit Servants
LUCULLUS:
And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted
LUCULLUS:
gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord
LUCULLUS:
and master?
FLAMINIUS:
His health is well sir.
LUCULLUS:
I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and
LUCULLUS:
what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?
FLAMINIUS:
'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which, in my
FLAMINIUS:
lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to
FLAMINIUS:
supply, who, having great and instant occasion to
FLAMINIUS:
use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to
FLAMINIUS:
furnish him, nothing doubting your present
FLAMINIUS:
assistance therein.
LUCULLUS:
La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,
LUCULLUS:
good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not
LUCULLUS:
keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'
LUCULLUS:
dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to
LUCULLUS:
supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,
LUCULLUS:
and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning
LUCULLUS:
by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty
LUCULLUS:
is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get
LUCULLUS:
him from't.
LUCULLUS:
Re-enter Servant, with wine
Servant:
Please your lordship, here is the wine.
LUCULLUS:
Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.
FLAMINIUS:
Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
LUCULLUS:
I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
LUCULLUS:
spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what
LUCULLUS:
belongs to reason, and canst use the time well, if
LUCULLUS:
the time use thee well: good parts in thee.
LUCULLUS:
To Servant
LUCULLUS:
Get you gone, sirrah.
LUCULLUS:
Exit Servant
LUCULLUS:
Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a
LUCULLUS:
bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise, and thou
LUCULLUS:
knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,
LUCULLUS:
that this is no time to lend money, especially upon
LUCULLUS:
bare friendship, without security. Here's three
LUCULLUS:
solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say
LUCULLUS:
thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.
FLAMINIUS:
Is't possible the world should so much differ,
FLAMINIUS:
And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,
FLAMINIUS:
To him that worships thee!
FLAMINIUS:
Throwing the money back
LUCULLUS:
Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.
LUCULLUS:
Exit
FLAMINIUS:
May these add to the number that may scald thee!
FLAMINIUS:
Let moulten coin be thy damnation,
FLAMINIUS:
Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!
FLAMINIUS:
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,
FLAMINIUS:
It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,
FLAMINIUS:
I feel master's passion! this slave,
FLAMINIUS:
Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him
FLAMINIUS:
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,
FLAMINIUS:
When he is turn'd to poison?
FLAMINIUS:
O, may diseases only work upon't!
FLAMINIUS:
And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
FLAMINIUS:
Which my lord paid for, be of any power
FLAMINIUS:
To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!
FLAMINIUS:
Exit
FLAMINIUS:
SCENE II. A public place.
FLAMINIUS:
Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers
LUCILIUS:
Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and
LUCILIUS:
an honourable gentleman.
First Stranger:
We know him for no less, though we are but strangers
First Stranger:
to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
First Stranger:
which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
First Stranger:
happy hours are done and past, and his estate
First Stranger:
shrinks from him.
LUCILIUS:
Fie, no, do not believe it, he cannot want for money.
Second Stranger:
But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,
Second Stranger:
one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
Second Stranger:
so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and
Second Stranger:
showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.
LUCILIUS:
How!
Second Stranger:
I tell you, denied, my lord.
LUCILIUS:
What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,
LUCILIUS:
I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!
LUCILIUS:
there was very little honour showed in't. For my own
LUCILIUS:
part, I must needs confess, I have received some
LUCILIUS:
small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels
LUCILIUS:
and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his,
LUCILIUS:
yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should
LUCILIUS:
ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.
LUCILIUS:
Enter SERVILIUS
SERVILIUS:
See, by good hap, yonder's my lord,
SERVILIUS:
I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,--
SERVILIUS:
To LUCIUS
LUCILIUS:
Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well
LUCILIUS:
commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very
LUCILIUS:
exquisite friend.
SERVILIUS:
May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--
LUCILIUS:
Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to
LUCILIUS:
that lord, he's ever sending: how shall I thank
LUCILIUS:
him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?
SERVILIUS:
Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord,
SERVILIUS:
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
SERVILIUS:
with so many talents.
LUCILIUS:
I know his lordship is but merry with me,
LUCILIUS:
He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.
SERVILIUS:
But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
SERVILIUS:
If his occasion were not virtuous,
SERVILIUS:
I should not urge it half so faithfully.
LUCILIUS:
Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
SERVILIUS:
Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.
LUCILIUS:
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself
LUCILIUS:
against such a good time, when I might ha' shown
LUCILIUS:
myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I
LUCILIUS:
should purchase the day before for a little part,
LUCILIUS:
and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,
LUCILIUS:
before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more
LUCILIUS:
beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon
LUCILIUS:
myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would
LUCILIUS:
not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.
LUCILIUS:
Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I
LUCILIUS:
hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,
LUCILIUS:
because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
LUCILIUS:
this from me, I count it one of my greatest
LUCILIUS:
afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
LUCILIUS:
honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you
LUCILIUS:
befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?
SERVILIUS:
Yes, sir, I shall.
LUCILIUS:
I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.
LUCILIUS:
Exit SERVILIUS
LUCILIUS:
True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed,
LUCILIUS:
And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
LUCILIUS:
Exit
First Stranger:
Do you observe this, Hostilius?
Second Stranger:
Ay, too well.
First Stranger:
Why, this is the world's soul, and just of the
First Stranger:
same piece
First Stranger:
Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
First Stranger:
His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
First Stranger:
My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
First Stranger:
And kept his credit with his purse,
First Stranger:
Supported his estate, nay, Timon's money
First Stranger:
Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,
First Stranger:
But Timon's silver treads upon his lip,
First Stranger:
And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man
First Stranger:
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
First Stranger:
He does deny him, in respect of his,
First Stranger:
What charitable men afford to beggars.
Third Stranger:
Religion groans at it.
First Stranger:
For mine own part,
First Stranger:
I never tasted Timon in my life,
First Stranger:
Nor came any of his bounties over me,
First Stranger:
To mark me for his friend, yet, I protest,
First Stranger:
For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
First Stranger:
And honourable carriage,
First Stranger:
Had his necessity made use of me,
First Stranger:
I would have put my wealth into donation,
First Stranger:
And the best half should have return'd to him,
First Stranger:
So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
First Stranger:
Men must learn now with pity to dispense,
First Stranger:
For policy sits above conscience.
First Stranger:
Exeunt
First Stranger:
SCENE III. A room in Sempronius' house.
First Stranger:
Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's
SEMPRONIUS:
Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'bove
SEMPRONIUS:
all others?
SEMPRONIUS:
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus,
SEMPRONIUS:
And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
SEMPRONIUS:
Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
SEMPRONIUS:
Owe their estates unto him.
Servant:
My lord,
Servant:
They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
Servant:
They have au denied him.
SEMPRONIUS:
How! have they denied him?
SEMPRONIUS:
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
SEMPRONIUS:
And does he send to me? Three? hum!
SEMPRONIUS:
It shows but little love or judgment in him
SEMPRONIUS:
Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
SEMPRONIUS:
physicians,
SEMPRONIUS:
Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
SEMPRONIUS:
Has much disgraced me in't, I'm angry at him,
SEMPRONIUS:
That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,
SEMPRONIUS:
But his occasion might have woo'd me first,
SEMPRONIUS:
For, in my conscience, I was the first man
SEMPRONIUS:
That e'er received gift from him
SEMPRONIUS:
And does he think so backwardly of me now,
SEMPRONIUS:
That I'll requite its last? No
SEMPRONIUS:
So it may prove an argument of laughter
SEMPRONIUS:
To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.
SEMPRONIUS:
I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
SEMPRONIUS:
Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake,
SEMPRONIUS:
I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
SEMPRONIUS:
And with their faint reply this answer join,
SEMPRONIUS:
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
SEMPRONIUS:
Exit
Servant:
Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
Servant:
devil knew not what he did when he made man
Servant:
politic, he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot
Servant:
think but, in the end, the villainies of man will
Servant:
set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
Servant:
appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,
Servant:
like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
Servant:
whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
Servant:
politic love.
Servant:
This was my lord's best hope, now all are fled,
Servant:
Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,
Servant:
Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
Servant:
Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
Servant:
Now to guard sure their master.
Servant:
And this is all a liberal course allows,
Servant:
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.
Servant:
Exit
Servant:
SCENE IV. The same. A hall in Timon's house.
Servant:
Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of  LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming out
Servant:
Varro's
First Servant:
Well met, good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.
TITUS:
The like to you kind Varro.
HORTENSIUS:
Lucius!
HORTENSIUS:
What, do we meet together?
HORTENSIUS:
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, and I think
HORTENSIUS:
One business does command us all, for mine Is money.
TITUS:
So is theirs and ours.
TITUS:
Enter PHILOTUS
TITUS:
Lucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!
PHILOTUS:
Good day at once.
PHILOTUS:
Lucilius' Servant	                  Welcome, good brother.
PHILOTUS:
What do you think the hour?
PHILOTUS:
Labouring for nine.
PHILOTUS:
Lucilius' Servant	So much?
PHILOTUS:
Is not my lord seen yet?
PHILOTUS:
Lucilius' Servant	Not yet.
PHILOTUS:
I wonder on't, he was wont to shine at seven.
PHILOTUS:
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him
PHILOTUS:
You must consider that a prodigal course
PHILOTUS:
Is like the sun's, but not, like his, recoverable.
PHILOTUS:
I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse,
PHILOTUS:
That is one may reach deep enough, and yet
PHILOTUS:
Find little.
PHILOTUS:
I am of your fear for that.
TITUS:
I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
TITUS:
Your lord sends now for money.
HORTENSIUS:
Most true, he does.
TITUS:
And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
TITUS:
For which I wait for money.
HORTENSIUS:
It is against my heart.
HORTENSIUS:
Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,
HORTENSIUS:
Timon in this should pay more than he owes
HORTENSIUS:
And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,
HORTENSIUS:
And send for money for 'em.
HORTENSIUS:
I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness
HORTENSIUS:
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,
HORTENSIUS:
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
HORTENSIUS:
Varro's
First Servant:
Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?
First Servant:
Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand mine.
First Servant:
Varro's
First Servant:
'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,
First Servant:
Your master's confidence was above mine,
First Servant:
Else, surely, his had equall'd.
First Servant:
Enter FLAMINIUS.
TITUS:
One of Lord Timon's men.
TITUS:
Lucilius' Servant	Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready to
TITUS:
come forth?
FLAMINIUS:
No, indeed, he is not.
TITUS:
We attend his lordship, pray, signify so much.
FLAMINIUS:
I need not tell him that, he knows you are too diligent.
FLAMINIUS:
Exit
FLAMINIUS:
Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffled
FLAMINIUS:
Lucilius' Servant	Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?
FLAMINIUS:
He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.
TITUS:
Do you hear, sir?
TITUS:
Varro's
Second Servant:
By your leave, sir,--
FLAVIUS:
What do ye ask of me, my friend?
TITUS:
We wait for certain money here, sir.
FLAVIUS:
Ay,
FLAVIUS:
If money were as certain as your waiting,
FLAVIUS:
'Twere sure enough.
FLAVIUS:
Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
FLAVIUS:
When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
FLAVIUS:
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
FLAVIUS:
And take down the interest into their
FLAVIUS:
gluttonous maws.
FLAVIUS:
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up,
FLAVIUS:
Let me pass quietly
FLAVIUS:
Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end,
FLAVIUS:
I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
FLAVIUS:
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but this answer will not serve.
FLAVIUS:
If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you,
FLAVIUS:
For you serve knaves.
FLAVIUS:
Exit
FLAVIUS:
Varro's
First Servant:
How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
First Servant:
Varro's
Second Servant:
No matter what, he's poor, and that's revenge
Second Servant:
enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
Second Servant:
house to put his head in? such may rail against
Second Servant:
great buildings.
Second Servant:
Enter SERVILIUS
TITUS:
O, here's Servilius, now we shall know some answer.
SERVILIUS:
If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some
SERVILIUS:
other hour, I should derive much from't, for,
SERVILIUS:
take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to
SERVILIUS:
discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him,
SERVILIUS:
he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
SERVILIUS:
Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick
SERVILIUS:
And, if it be so far beyond his health,
SERVILIUS:
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
SERVILIUS:
And make a clear way to the gods.
SERVILIUS:
Good gods!
TITUS:
We cannot take this for answer, sir.
FLAMINIUS:
[Within]  Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!
FLAMINIUS:
Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following
TIMON:
What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
TIMON:
Have I been ever free, and must my house
TIMON:
Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
TIMON:
The place which I have feasted, does it now,
TIMON:
Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
TIMON:
Lucilius' Servant	Put in now, Titus.
TITUS:
My lord, here is my bill.
TITUS:
Lucilius' Servant	Here's mine.
HORTENSIUS:
And mine, my lord.
HORTENSIUS:
Both
HORTENSIUS:
Varro's Servants	And ours, my lord.
PHILOTUS:
All our bills.
TIMON:
Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
TIMON:
Lucilius' Servant	Alas, my lord,-
TIMON:
Cut my heart in sums.
TITUS:
Mine, fifty talents.
TIMON:
Tell out my blood.
TIMON:
Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand crowns, my lord.
TIMON:
Five thousand drops pays that.
TIMON:
What yours?--and yours?
TIMON:
Varro's
First Servant:
My lord,--
First Servant:
Varro's
Second Servant:
My lord,--
TIMON:
Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!
TIMON:
Exit
HORTENSIUS:
'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps
HORTENSIUS:
at their money: these debts may well be called
HORTENSIUS:
desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.
HORTENSIUS:
Exeunt
HORTENSIUS:
Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS
TIMON:
They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
TIMON:
Creditors? devils!
FLAVIUS:
My dear lord,--
TIMON:
What if it should be so?
FLAVIUS:
My lord,--
TIMON:
I'll have it so. My steward!
FLAVIUS:
Here, my lord.
TIMON:
So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,
TIMON:
Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius
TIMON:
All, sirrah, all
TIMON:
I'll once more feast the rascals.
FLAVIUS:
O my lord,
FLAVIUS:
You only speak from your distracted soul,
FLAVIUS:
There is not so much left, to furnish out
FLAVIUS:
A moderate table.
TIMON:
Be't not in thy care, go,
TIMON:
I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide
TIMON:
Of knaves once more, my cook and I'll provide.
TIMON:
Exeunt
TIMON:
SCENE V. The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.
First Senator:
My lord, you have my voice to it, the fault's
First Senator:
Bloody, 'tis necessary he should die
First Senator:
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
Second Senator:
Most true, the law shall bruise him.
Second Senator:
Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants
ALCIBIADES:
Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!
First Senator:
Now, captain?
ALCIBIADES:
I am an humble suitor to your virtues,
ALCIBIADES:
For pity is the virtue of the law,
ALCIBIADES:
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
ALCIBIADES:
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
ALCIBIADES:
Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
ALCIBIADES:
Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
ALCIBIADES:
To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.
ALCIBIADES:
He is a man, setting his fate aside,
ALCIBIADES:
Of comely virtues
ALCIBIADES:
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
ALCIBIADES:
An honour in him which buys out his fault--
ALCIBIADES:
But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
ALCIBIADES:
Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
ALCIBIADES:
He did oppose his foe
ALCIBIADES:
And with such sober and unnoted passion
ALCIBIADES:
He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
ALCIBIADES:
As if he had but proved an argument.
First Senator:
You undergo too strict a paradox,
First Senator:
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair
First Senator:
Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
First Senator:
To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
First Senator:
Upon the head of valour, which indeed
First Senator:
Is valour misbegot and came into the world
First Senator:
When sects and factions were newly born
First Senator:
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
First Senator:
The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
First Senator:
His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,
First Senator:
carelessly,
First Senator:
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
First Senator:
To bring it into danger.
First Senator:
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
First Senator:
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
ALCIBIADES:
My lord,--
First Senator:
You cannot make gross sins look clear
First Senator:
To revenge is no valour, but to bear.
ALCIBIADES:
My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,
ALCIBIADES:
If I speak like a captain.
ALCIBIADES:
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
ALCIBIADES:
And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,
ALCIBIADES:
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
ALCIBIADES:
Without repugnancy? If there be
ALCIBIADES:
Such valour in the bearing, what make we
ALCIBIADES:
Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
ALCIBIADES:
That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
ALCIBIADES:
And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
ALCIBIADES:
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
ALCIBIADES:
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,
ALCIBIADES:
As you are great, be pitifully good
ALCIBIADES:
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
ALCIBIADES:
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust,
ALCIBIADES:
But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
ALCIBIADES:
To be in anger is impiety,
ALCIBIADES:
But who is man that is not angry?
ALCIBIADES:
Weigh but the crime with this.
Second Senator:
You breathe in vain.
ALCIBIADES:
In vain! his service done
ALCIBIADES:
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
ALCIBIADES:
Were a sufficient briber for his life.
First Senator:
What's that?
ALCIBIADES:
I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
ALCIBIADES:
And slain in fight many of your enemies
ALCIBIADES:
How full of valour did he bear himself
ALCIBIADES:
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
Second Senator:
He has made too much plenty with 'em,
Second Senator:
He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
Second Senator:
Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner
Second Senator:
If there were no foes, that were enough
Second Senator:
To overcome him: in that beastly fury
Second Senator:
He has been known to commit outrages,
Second Senator:
And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
Second Senator:
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.
First Senator:
He dies.
ALCIBIADES:
Hard fate! he might have died in war.
ALCIBIADES:
My lords, if not for any parts in him--
ALCIBIADES:
Though his right arm might purchase his own time
ALCIBIADES:
And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,
ALCIBIADES:
Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both
ALCIBIADES:
And, for I know your reverend ages love
ALCIBIADES:
Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
ALCIBIADES:
My honours to you, upon his good returns.
ALCIBIADES:
If by this crime he owes the law his life,
ALCIBIADES:
Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore
ALCIBIADES:
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.
First Senator:
We are for law: he dies, urge it no more,
First Senator:
On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,
First Senator:
He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
ALCIBIADES:
Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
ALCIBIADES:
I do beseech you, know me.
Second Senator:
How!
ALCIBIADES:
Call me to your remembrances.
Third Senator:
What!
ALCIBIADES:
I cannot think but your age has forgot me,
ALCIBIADES:
It could not else be, I should prove so base,
ALCIBIADES:
To sue, and be denied such common grace
ALCIBIADES:
My wounds ache at you.
First Senator:
Do you dare our anger?
First Senator:
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect,
First Senator:
We banish thee for ever.
ALCIBIADES:
Banish me!
ALCIBIADES:
Banish your dotage, banish usury,
ALCIBIADES:
That makes the senate ugly.
First Senator:
If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,
First Senator:
Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell
First Senator:
our spirit,
First Senator:
He shall be executed presently.
First Senator:
Exeunt Senators
ALCIBIADES:
Now the gods keep you old enough, that you may live
ALCIBIADES:
Only in bone, that none may look on you!
ALCIBIADES:
I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,
ALCIBIADES:
While they have told their money and let out
ALCIBIADES:
Their coin upon large interest, I myself
ALCIBIADES:
Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
ALCIBIADES:
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
ALCIBIADES:
Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
ALCIBIADES:
It comes not ill, I hate not to be banish'd,
ALCIBIADES:
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
ALCIBIADES:
That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up
ALCIBIADES:
My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.
ALCIBIADES:
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds,
ALCIBIADES:
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
ALCIBIADES:
Exit
ALCIBIADES:
SCENE VI. The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.
ALCIBIADES:
Music. Tables set out: Servants attending.  Enter divers Lords, Senators and others, at several doors
First Lord:
The good time of day to you, sir.
Second Lord:
I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
Second Lord:
did but try us this other day.
First Lord:
Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we
First Lord:
encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as
First Lord:
he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.
Second Lord:
It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.
First Lord:
I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest
First Lord:
inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me
First Lord:
to put off, but he hath conjured me beyond them, and
First Lord:
I must needs appear.
Second Lord:
In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
Second Lord:
business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am
Second Lord:
sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my
Second Lord:
provision was out.
First Lord:
I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
First Lord:
things go.
Second Lord:
Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
Second Lord:
you?
First Lord:
A thousand pieces.
Second Lord:
A thousand pieces!
First Lord:
What of you?
Second Lord:
He sent to me, sir,--Here he comes.
Second Lord:
Enter TIMON and Attendants
TIMON:
With all my heart, gentlemen both, and how fare you?
First Lord:
Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
Second Lord:
The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
Second Lord:
your lordship.
TIMON:
[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter, such
TIMON:
summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not
TIMON:
recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the
TIMON:
music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the
TIMON:
trumpet's sound, we shall to 't presently.
First Lord:
I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
First Lord:
that I returned you an empty messenger.
TIMON:
O, sir, let it not trouble you.
Second Lord:
My noble lord,--
TIMON:
Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
Second Lord:
My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,
Second Lord:
that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,
Second Lord:
I was so unfortunate a beggar.
TIMON:
Think not on 't, sir.
Second Lord:
If you had sent but two hours before,--
TIMON:
Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
TIMON:
The banquet brought in
TIMON:
Come, bring in all together.
Second Lord:
All covered dishes!
First Lord:
Royal cheer, I warrant you.
Third Lord:
Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield
Third Lord:
it.
First Lord:
How do you? What's the news?
Third Lord:
Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?
Second Lord:
Alcibiades banished!
Third Lord:
'Tis so, be sure of it.
First Lord:
How! how!
Second Lord:
I pray you, upon what?
TIMON:
My worthy friends, will you draw near?
Third Lord:
I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
Second Lord:
This is the old man still.
Third Lord:
Will 't hold? will 't hold?
Second Lord:
It does: but time will--and so--
Third Lord:
I do conceive.
TIMON:
Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to
TIMON:
the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
TIMON:
places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let
TIMON:
the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place
TIMON:
sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
TIMON:
You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with
TIMON:
thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves
TIMON:
praised: but reserve still to give, lest your
TIMON:
deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that
TIMON:
one need not lend to another, for, were your
TIMON:
godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the
TIMON:
gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
TIMON:
that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
TIMON:
a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
TIMON:
the table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. The
TIMON:
rest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,
TIMON:
together with the common lag of people--what is
TIMON:
amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for
TIMON:
destruction. For these my present friends, as they
TIMON:
are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to
TIMON:
nothing are they welcome.
TIMON:
Uncover, dogs, and lap.
TIMON:
The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water
Some Speak:
What does his lordship mean?
Some Others:
I know not.
TIMON:
May you a better feast never behold,
TIMON:
You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water
TIMON:
Is your perfection. This is Timon's last,
TIMON:
Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
TIMON:
Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces
TIMON:
Your reeking villany.
TIMON:
Throwing the water in their faces
TIMON:
Live loathed and long,
TIMON:
Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
TIMON:
Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,
TIMON:
You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,
TIMON:
Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!
TIMON:
Of man and beast the infinite malady
TIMON:
Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?
TIMON:
Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou,--
TIMON:
Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.
TIMON:
Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out
TIMON:
What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,
TIMON:
Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
TIMON:
Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be
TIMON:
Of Timon man and all humanity!
TIMON:
Exit
TIMON:
Re-enter the Lords, Senators,  and c
First Lord:
How now, my lords!
Second Lord:
Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
Third Lord:
Push! did you see my cap?
Fourth Lord:
I have lost my gown.
First Lord:
He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.
First Lord:
He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has
First Lord:
beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?
Third Lord:
Did you see my cap?
Second Lord:
Here 'tis.
Fourth Lord:
Here lies my gown.
First Lord:
Let's make no stay.
Second Lord:
Lord Timon's mad.
Third Lord:
I feel 't upon my bones.
Fourth Lord:
One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
Fourth Lord:
Exeunt
Fourth Lord:
ACT IV
Fourth Lord:
SCENE I. Without the walls of Athens.
Fourth Lord:
Enter TIMON
TIMON:
Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
TIMON:
That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,
TIMON:
And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!
TIMON:
Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
TIMON:
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
TIMON:
And minister in their steads! to general filths
TIMON:
Convert o' the instant, green virginity,
TIMON:
Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast,
TIMON:
Rather than render back, out with your knives,
TIMON:
And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
TIMON:
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
TIMON:
And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed,
TIMON:
Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
TIMON:
pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,
TIMON:
With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
TIMON:
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
TIMON:
Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
TIMON:
Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
TIMON:
Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
TIMON:
Decline to your confounding contraries,
TIMON:
And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,
TIMON:
Your potent and infectious fevers heap
TIMON:
On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
TIMON:
Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
TIMON:
As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty
TIMON:
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
TIMON:
That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
TIMON:
And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
TIMON:
Sow all the Athenian bosoms, and their crop
TIMON:
Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
TIMON:
at their society, as their friendship, may
TIMON:
merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,
TIMON:
But nakedness, thou detestable town!
TIMON:
Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
TIMON:
Timon will to the woods, where he shall find
TIMON:
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
TIMON:
The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--
TIMON:
The Athenians both within and out that wall!
TIMON:
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
TIMON:
To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.
TIMON:
Exit
TIMON:
SCENE II. Athens. A room in Timon's house.
TIMON:
Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants
First Servant:
Hear you, master steward, where's our master?
First Servant:
Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?
FLAVIUS:
Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
FLAVIUS:
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
FLAVIUS:
I am as poor as you.
First Servant:
Such a house broke!
First Servant:
So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not
First Servant:
One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
First Servant:
And go along with him!
Second Servant:
As we do turn our backs
Second Servant:
From our companion thrown into his grave,
Second Servant:
So his familiars to his buried fortunes
Second Servant:
Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,
Second Servant:
Like empty purses pick'd, and his poor self,
Second Servant:
A dedicated beggar to the air,
Second Servant:
With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,
Second Servant:
Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.
Second Servant:
Enter other Servants
FLAVIUS:
All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
Third Servant:
Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery,
Third Servant:
That see I by our faces, we are fellows still,
Third Servant:
Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,
Third Servant:
And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
Third Servant:
Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
Third Servant:
Into this sea of air.
FLAVIUS:
Good fellows all,
FLAVIUS:
The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
FLAVIUS:
Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
FLAVIUS:
Let's yet be fellows, let's shake our heads, and say,
FLAVIUS:
As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
FLAVIUS:
'We have seen better days.' Let each take some,
FLAVIUS:
Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more
FLAVIUS:
Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
FLAVIUS:
Servants embrace, and part several ways
FLAVIUS:
O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
FLAVIUS:
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
FLAVIUS:
Since riches point to misery and contempt?
FLAVIUS:
Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
FLAVIUS:
But in a dream of friendship?
FLAVIUS:
To have his pomp and all what state compounds
FLAVIUS:
But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
FLAVIUS:
Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
FLAVIUS:
Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
FLAVIUS:
When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!
FLAVIUS:
Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?
FLAVIUS:
For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
FLAVIUS:
My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
FLAVIUS:
Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
FLAVIUS:
Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!
FLAVIUS:
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
FLAVIUS:
Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to
FLAVIUS:
Supply his life, or that which can command it.
FLAVIUS:
I'll follow and inquire him out
FLAVIUS:
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will,
FLAVIUS:
Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.
FLAVIUS:
Exit
FLAVIUS:
SCENE III. Woods and cave, near the seashore.
FLAVIUS:
Enter TIMON, from the cave
FLAVIUS:
O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
FLAVIUS:
Rotten humidity, below thy sister's orb
FLAVIUS:
Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,
FLAVIUS:
Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
FLAVIUS:
Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes,
FLAVIUS:
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
FLAVIUS:
To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,
FLAVIUS:
But by contempt of nature.
FLAVIUS:
Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord,
FLAVIUS:
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
FLAVIUS:
The beggar native honour.
FLAVIUS:
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
FLAVIUS:
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
FLAVIUS:
In purity of manhood stand upright,
FLAVIUS:
And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,
FLAVIUS:
So are they all, for every grise of fortune
FLAVIUS:
Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
FLAVIUS:
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique,
FLAVIUS:
There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
FLAVIUS:
But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
FLAVIUS:
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
FLAVIUS:
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains
FLAVIUS:
Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
FLAVIUS:
Digging
FLAVIUS:
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
FLAVIUS:
With thy most operant poison! What is here?
FLAVIUS:
Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,
FLAVIUS:
I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!
FLAVIUS:
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
FLAVIUS:
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
FLAVIUS:
Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this
FLAVIUS:
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
FLAVIUS:
Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads
FLAVIUS:
This yellow slave
FLAVIUS:
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
FLAVIUS:
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
FLAVIUS:
And give them title, knee and approbation
FLAVIUS:
With senators on the bench: this is it
FLAVIUS:
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again,
FLAVIUS:
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
FLAVIUS:
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
FLAVIUS:
To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
FLAVIUS:
Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds
FLAVIUS:
Among the route of nations, I will make thee
FLAVIUS:
Do thy right nature.
FLAVIUS:
March afar off
FLAVIUS:
Ha! a drum ? Thou'rt quick,
FLAVIUS:
But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,
FLAVIUS:
When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
FLAVIUS:
Nay, stay thou out for earnest.
FLAVIUS:
Keeping some gold
FLAVIUS:
Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in warlike manner, PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA
ALCIBIADES:
What art thou there? speak.
TIMON:
A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
TIMON:
For showing me again the eyes of man!
ALCIBIADES:
What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,
ALCIBIADES:
That art thyself a man?
TIMON:
I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
TIMON:
For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
TIMON:
That I might love thee something.
ALCIBIADES:
I know thee well,
ALCIBIADES:
But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
TIMON:
I know thee too, and more than that I know thee,
TIMON:
I not desire to know. Follow thy drum,
TIMON:
With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules
TIMON:
Religious canons, civil laws are cruel,
TIMON:
Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
TIMON:
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
TIMON:
For all her cherubim look.
PHRYNIA:
Thy lips rot off!
TIMON:
I will not kiss thee, then the rot returns
TIMON:
To thine own lips again.
ALCIBIADES:
How came the noble Timon to this change?
TIMON:
As the moon does, by wanting light to give
TIMON:
But then renew I could not, like the moon,
TIMON:
There were no suns to borrow of.
ALCIBIADES:
Noble Timon,
ALCIBIADES:
What friendship may I do thee?
TIMON:
None, but to
TIMON:
Maintain my opinion.
ALCIBIADES:
What is it, Timon?
TIMON:
Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou
TIMON:
wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art
TIMON:
a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for
TIMON:
thou art a man!
ALCIBIADES:
I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
TIMON:
Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
ALCIBIADES:
I see them now, then was a blessed time.
TIMON:
As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
TIMANDRA:
Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world
TIMANDRA:
Voiced so regardfully?
TIMON:
Art thou Timandra?
TIMANDRA:
Yes.
TIMON:
Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee,
TIMON:
Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
TIMON:
Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
TIMON:
For tubs and baths, bring down rose-cheeked youth
TIMON:
To the tub-fast and the diet.
TIMANDRA:
Hang thee, monster!
ALCIBIADES:
Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits
ALCIBIADES:
Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
ALCIBIADES:
I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
ALCIBIADES:
The want whereof doth daily make revolt
ALCIBIADES:
In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,
ALCIBIADES:
How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
ALCIBIADES:
Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
ALCIBIADES:
But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--
TIMON:
I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.
ALCIBIADES:
I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.
TIMON:
How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
TIMON:
I had rather be alone.
ALCIBIADES:
Why, fare thee well
ALCIBIADES:
Here is some gold for thee.
TIMON:
Keep it, I cannot eat it.
ALCIBIADES:
When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--
TIMON:
Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?
ALCIBIADES:
Ay, Timon, and have cause.
TIMON:
The gods confound them all in thy conquest,
TIMON:
And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!
ALCIBIADES:
Why me, Timon?
TIMON:
That, by killing of villains,
TIMON:
Thou wast born to conquer my country.
TIMON:
Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on,
TIMON:
Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
TIMON:
Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
TIMON:
In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one
TIMON:
Pity not honour'd age for his white beard,
TIMON:
He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron,
TIMON:
It is her habit only that is honest,
TIMON:
Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
TIMON:
Make soft thy trenchant sword, for those milk-paps,
TIMON:
That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
TIMON:
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
TIMON:
But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
TIMON:
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy,
TIMON:
Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
TIMON:
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
TIMON:
And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects,
TIMON:
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes,
TIMON:
Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
TIMON:
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
TIMON:
Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers
TIMON:
Make large confusion, and, thy fury spent,
TIMON:
Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.
ALCIBIADES:
Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou
ALCIBIADES:
givest me,
ALCIBIADES:
Not all thy counsel.
TIMON:
Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse
TIMON:
upon thee!
TIMANDRA:
Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?
TIMON:
Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
TIMON:
And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
TIMON:
Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,
TIMON:
Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear
TIMON:
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
TIMON:
The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,
TIMON:
I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still,
TIMON:
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
TIMON:
Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up,
TIMON:
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
TIMON:
And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
TIMON:
Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
TIMON:
With burthens of the dead,--some that were hang'd,
TIMON:
No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still,
TIMON:
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,
TIMON:
A pox of wrinkles!
TIMANDRA:
Well, more gold: what then?
TIMANDRA:
Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.
TIMON:
Consumptions sow
TIMON:
In hollow bones of man, strike their sharp shins,
TIMON:
And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
TIMON:
That he may never more false title plead,
TIMON:
Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
TIMON:
That scolds against the quality of flesh,
TIMON:
And not believes himself: down with the nose,
TIMON:
Down with it flat, take the bridge quite away
TIMON:
Of him that, his particular to foresee,
TIMON:
Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate
TIMON:
ruffians bald,
TIMON:
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
TIMON:
Derive some pain from you: plague all,
TIMON:
That your activity may defeat and quell
TIMON:
The source of all erection. There's more gold
TIMON:
Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
TIMON:
And ditches grave you all!
TIMANDRA:
More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.
TIMON:
More whore, more mischief first, I have given you earnest.
ALCIBIADES:
Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon
ALCIBIADES:
If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.
TIMON:
If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
ALCIBIADES:
I never did thee harm.
TIMON:
Yes, thou spokest well of me.
ALCIBIADES:
Call'st thou that harm?
TIMON:
Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
TIMON:
Thy beagles with thee.
ALCIBIADES:
We but offend him. Strike!
ALCIBIADES:
Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA, and TIMANDRA
TIMON:
That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
TIMON:
Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,
TIMON:
Digging
TIMON:
Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,
TIMON:
Teems, and feeds all, whose self-same mettle,
TIMON:
Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
TIMON:
Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
TIMON:
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
TIMON:
With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
TIMON:
Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine,
TIMON:
Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
TIMON:
From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
TIMON:
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
TIMON:
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
TIMON:
Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears,
TIMON:
Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face
TIMON:
Hath to the marbled mansion all above
TIMON:
Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
TIMON:
Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas,
TIMON:
Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts
TIMON:
And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
TIMON:
That from it all consideration slips!
TIMON:
Enter APEMANTUS
TIMON:
More man? plague, plague!
APEMANTUS:
I was directed hither: men report
APEMANTUS:
Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.
TIMON:
'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
TIMON:
Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!
APEMANTUS:
This is in thee a nature but infected,
APEMANTUS:
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
APEMANTUS:
From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
APEMANTUS:
This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
APEMANTUS:
Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,
APEMANTUS:
Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot
APEMANTUS:
That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
APEMANTUS:
By putting on the cunning of a carper.
APEMANTUS:
Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
APEMANTUS:
By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
APEMANTUS:
And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
APEMANTUS:
Blow off thy cap, praise his most vicious strain,
APEMANTUS:
And call it excellent: thou wast told thus,
APEMANTUS:
Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
APEMANTUS:
To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
APEMANTUS:
That thou turn rascal, hadst thou wealth again,
APEMANTUS:
Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.
TIMON:
Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.
APEMANTUS:
Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself,
APEMANTUS:
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
APEMANTUS:
That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
APEMANTUS:
Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,
APEMANTUS:
That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
APEMANTUS:
And skip where thou point'st out? will the
APEMANTUS:
cold brook,
APEMANTUS:
Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
APEMANTUS:
To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
APEMANTUS:
Whose naked natures live in an the spite
APEMANTUS:
Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
APEMANTUS:
To the conflicting elements exposed,
APEMANTUS:
Answer mere nature, bid them flatter thee,
APEMANTUS:
O, thou shalt find--
TIMON:
A fool of thee: depart.
APEMANTUS:
I love thee better now than e'er I did.
TIMON:
I hate thee worse.
APEMANTUS:
Why?
TIMON:
Thou flatter'st misery.
APEMANTUS:
I flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff.
TIMON:
Why dost thou seek me out?
APEMANTUS:
To vex thee.
TIMON:
Always a villain's office or a fool's.
TIMON:
Dost please thyself in't?
APEMANTUS:
Ay.
TIMON:
What! a knave too?
APEMANTUS:
If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
APEMANTUS:
To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou
APEMANTUS:
Dost it enforcedly, thou'ldst courtier be again,
APEMANTUS:
Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
APEMANTUS:
Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before
APEMANTUS:
The one is filling still, never complete,
APEMANTUS:
The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
APEMANTUS:
Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
APEMANTUS:
Worse than the worst, content.
APEMANTUS:
Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.
TIMON:
Not by his breath that is more miserable.
TIMON:
Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm
TIMON:
With favour never clasp'd, but bred a dog.
TIMON:
Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
TIMON:
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
TIMON:
To such as may the passive drugs of it
TIMON:
Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself
TIMON:
In general riot, melted down thy youth
TIMON:
In different beds of lust, and never learn'd
TIMON:
The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
TIMON:
The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
TIMON:
Who had the world as my confectionary,
TIMON:
The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
TIMON:
At duty, more than I could frame employment,
TIMON:
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
TIMON:
Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
TIMON:
Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
TIMON:
For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,
TIMON:
That never knew but better, is some burden
TIMON:
Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
TIMON:
Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
TIMON:
They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
TIMON:
If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
TIMON:
Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
TIMON:
To some she beggar and compounded thee
TIMON:
Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
TIMON:
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
TIMON:
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
APEMANTUS:
Art thou proud yet?
TIMON:
Ay, that I am not thee.
APEMANTUS:
I, that I was
APEMANTUS:
No prodigal.
TIMON:
I, that I am one now
TIMON:
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
TIMON:
I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
TIMON:
That the whole life of Athens were in this!
TIMON:
Thus would I eat it.
TIMON:
Eating a root
APEMANTUS:
Here, I will mend thy feast.
APEMANTUS:
Offering him a root
TIMON:
First mend my company, take away thyself.
APEMANTUS:
So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.
TIMON:
'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd,
TIMON:
if not, I would it were.
APEMANTUS:
What wouldst thou have to Athens?
TIMON:
Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
TIMON:
Tell them there I have gold, look, so I have.
APEMANTUS:
Here is no use for gold.
TIMON:
The best and truest,
TIMON:
For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.
APEMANTUS:
Where liest o' nights, Timon?
TIMON:
Under that's above me.
TIMON:
Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Where my stomach finds meat, or, rather, where I eat
APEMANTUS:
it.
TIMON:
Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!
APEMANTUS:
Where wouldst thou send it?
TIMON:
To sauce thy dishes.
APEMANTUS:
The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
APEMANTUS:
extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
APEMANTUS:
and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much
APEMANTUS:
curiosity, in thy rags thou knowest none, but art
APEMANTUS:
despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for
APEMANTUS:
thee, eat it.
TIMON:
On what I hate I feed not.
APEMANTUS:
Dost hate a medlar?
TIMON:
Ay, though it look like thee.
APEMANTUS:
An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst
APEMANTUS:
have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
APEMANTUS:
ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
TIMON:
Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou
TIMON:
ever know beloved?
APEMANTUS:
Myself.
TIMON:
I understand thee, thou hadst some means to keep a
TIMON:
dog.
APEMANTUS:
What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
APEMANTUS:
to thy flatterers?
TIMON:
Women nearest, but men, men are the things
TIMON:
themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,
TIMON:
Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?
APEMANTUS:
Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
TIMON:
Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
TIMON:
men, and remain a beast with the beasts?
APEMANTUS:
Ay, Timon.
TIMON:
A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'
TIMON:
attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would
TIMON:
beguile thee, if thou wert the lamb, the fox would
TIMON:
eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would
TIMON:
suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by
TIMON:
the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would
TIMON:
torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a
TIMON:
breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy
TIMON:
greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst
TIMON:
hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
TIMON:
unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and
TIMON:
make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
TIMON:
thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse
TIMON:
wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the
TIMON:
leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to
TIMON:
the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
TIMON:
thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
TIMON:
defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
TIMON:
were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
TIMON:
thou already, that seest not thy loss in
TIMON:
transformation!
APEMANTUS:
If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou
APEMANTUS:
mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of
APEMANTUS:
Athens is become a forest of beasts.
TIMON:
How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?
APEMANTUS:
Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of
APEMANTUS:
company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
APEMANTUS:
and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll
APEMANTUS:
see thee again.
TIMON:
When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be
TIMON:
welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
APEMANTUS:
Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
TIMON:
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
APEMANTUS:
A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
TIMON:
All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
APEMANTUS:
There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
TIMON:
If I name thee.
TIMON:
I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
APEMANTUS:
I would my tongue could rot them off!
TIMON:
Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
TIMON:
Choler does kill me that thou art alive,
TIMON:
I swound to see thee.
APEMANTUS:
Would thou wouldst burst!
TIMON:
Away,
TIMON:
Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
TIMON:
A stone by thee.
TIMON:
Throws a stone at him
APEMANTUS:
Beast!
TIMON:
Slave!
APEMANTUS:
Toad!
TIMON:
Rogue, rogue, rogue!
TIMON:
I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
TIMON:
But even the mere necessities upon 't.
TIMON:
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave,
TIMON:
Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
TIMON:
Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
TIMON:
That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
TIMON:
To the gold
TIMON:
O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
TIMON:
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
TIMON:
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
TIMON:
Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
TIMON:
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
TIMON:
That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
TIMON:
That solder'st close impossibilities,
TIMON:
And makest them kiss! that speak'st with
TIMON:
every tongue,
TIMON:
To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
TIMON:
Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
TIMON:
Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
TIMON:
May have the world in empire!
APEMANTUS:
Would 'twere so!
APEMANTUS:
But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold
APEMANTUS:
Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.
TIMON:
Throng'd to!
APEMANTUS:
Ay.
TIMON:
Thy back, I prithee.
APEMANTUS:
Live, and love thy misery.
TIMON:
Long live so, and so die.
TIMON:
Exit APEMANTUS
TIMON:
I am quit.
TIMON:
Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.
TIMON:
Enter Banditti
First Bandit:
Where should he have this gold? It is some poor
First Bandit:
fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the
First Bandit:
mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his
First Bandit:
friends, drove him into this melancholy.
Second Bandit:
It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
Third Bandit:
Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not
Third Bandit:
for't, he will supply us easily, if he covetously
Third Bandit:
reserve it, how shall's get it?
Second Bandit:
True, for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.
First Bandit:
Is not this he?
Banditti:
Where?
Second Bandit:
'Tis his description.
Third Bandit:
He, I know him.
Banditti:
Save thee, Timon.
TIMON:
Now, thieves?
Banditti:
Soldiers, not thieves.
TIMON:
Both too, and women's sons.
Banditti:
We are not thieves, but men that much do want.
TIMON:
Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
TIMON:
Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots,
TIMON:
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs,
TIMON:
The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips,
TIMON:
The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
TIMON:
Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
First Bandit:
We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
First Bandit:
As beasts and birds and fishes.
TIMON:
Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes,
TIMON:
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
TIMON:
That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
TIMON:
In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
TIMON:
In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
TIMON:
Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
TIMON:
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
TIMON:
And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician,
TIMON:
His antidotes are poison, and he slays
TIMON:
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together,
TIMON:
Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
TIMON:
Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
TIMON:
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
TIMON:
Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
TIMON:
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun
TIMON:
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
TIMON:
The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
TIMON:
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
TIMON:
From general excrement: each thing's a thief
TIMON:
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
TIMON:
Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
TIMON:
Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats
TIMON:
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
TIMON:
Break open shops, nothing can you steal,
TIMON:
But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
TIMON:
I give you, and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.
Third Bandit:
Has almost charmed me from my profession, by
Third Bandit:
persuading me to it.
First Bandit:
'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
First Bandit:
us, not to have us thrive in our mystery.
Second Bandit:
I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.
First Bandit:
Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time
First Bandit:
so miserable but a man may be true.
First Bandit:
Exeunt Banditti
First Bandit:
Enter FLAVIUS
FLAVIUS:
O you gods!
FLAVIUS:
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
FLAVIUS:
Full of decay and failing? O monument
FLAVIUS:
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
FLAVIUS:
What an alteration of honour
FLAVIUS:
Has desperate want made!
FLAVIUS:
What viler thing upon the earth than friends
FLAVIUS:
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
FLAVIUS:
How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
FLAVIUS:
When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
FLAVIUS:
Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
FLAVIUS:
Those that would mischief me than those that do!
FLAVIUS:
Has caught me in his eye: I will present
FLAVIUS:
My honest grief unto him, and, as my lord,
FLAVIUS:
Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!
TIMON:
Away! what art thou?
FLAVIUS:
Have you forgot me, sir?
TIMON:
Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men,
TIMON:
Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.
FLAVIUS:
An honest poor servant of yours.
TIMON:
Then I know thee not
TIMON:
I never had honest man about me, I, all
TIMON:
I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
FLAVIUS:
The gods are witness,
FLAVIUS:
Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
FLAVIUS:
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
TIMON:
What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I
TIMON:
love thee,
TIMON:
Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
TIMON:
Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give
TIMON:
But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping
TIMON:
Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!
FLAVIUS:
I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
FLAVIUS:
To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
FLAVIUS:
To entertain me as your steward still.
TIMON:
Had I a steward
TIMON:
So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
TIMON:
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
TIMON:
Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
TIMON:
Was born of woman.
TIMON:
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
TIMON:
You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
TIMON:
One honest man--mistake me not--but one,
TIMON:
No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.
TIMON:
How fain would I have hated all mankind!
TIMON:
And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
TIMON:
I fell with curses.
TIMON:
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise,
TIMON:
For, by oppressing and betraying me,
TIMON:
Thou mightst have sooner got another service
TIMON:
For many so arrive at second masters,
TIMON:
Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
TIMON:
For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--
TIMON:
Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
TIMON:
If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
TIMON:
Expecting in return twenty for one?
FLAVIUS:
No, my most worthy master, in whose breast
FLAVIUS:
Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late
FLAVIUS:
You should have fear'd false times when you did feast
FLAVIUS:
Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
FLAVIUS:
That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
FLAVIUS:
Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,
FLAVIUS:
Care of your food and living, and, believe it,
FLAVIUS:
My most honour'd lord,
FLAVIUS:
For any benefit that points to me,
FLAVIUS:
Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
FLAVIUS:
For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
FLAVIUS:
To requite me, by making rich yourself.
TIMON:
Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
TIMON:
Here, take: the gods out of my misery
TIMON:
Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,
TIMON:
But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men,
TIMON:
Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
TIMON:
But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
TIMON:
Ere thou relieve the beggar, give to dogs
TIMON:
What thou deny'st to men, let prisons swallow 'em,
TIMON:
Debts wither 'em to nothing, be men like
TIMON:
blasted woods,
TIMON:
And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
TIMON:
And so farewell and thrive.
FLAVIUS:
O, let me stay,
FLAVIUS:
And comfort you, my master.
TIMON:
If thou hatest curses,
TIMON:
Stay not, fly, whilst thou art blest and free
TIMON:
Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.
TIMON:
Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave
TIMON:
ACT V
TIMON:
SCENE I. The woods. Before Timon's cave.
TIMON:
Enter Poet and Painter, TIMON watching them from his cave
Painter:
As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where
Painter:
he abides.
Poet:
What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
Poet:
for true, that he's so full of gold?
Painter:
Certain: Alcibiades reports it, Phrynia and
Painter:
Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
Painter:
straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
Painter:
he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
Poet:
Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
Painter:
Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
Painter:
again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore
Painter:
'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this
Painter:
supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
Painter:
us, and is very likely to load our purposes with
Painter:
what they travail for, if it be a just true report
Painter:
that goes of his having.
Poet:
What have you now to present unto him?
Painter:
Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will
Painter:
promise him an excellent piece.
Poet:
I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent
Poet:
that's coming toward him.
Painter:
Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the
Painter:
time: it opens the eyes of expectation
Painter:
performance is ever the duller for his act, and,
Painter:
but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the
Painter:
deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
Painter:
most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
Painter:
of will or testament which argues a great sickness
Painter:
in his judgment that makes it.
Painter:
TIMON comes from his cave, behind
TIMON:
[Aside]  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a
TIMON:
man so bad as is thyself.
Poet:
I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for
Poet:
him: it must be a personating of himself, a satire
Poet:
against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery
Poet:
of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.
TIMON:
[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in
TIMON:
thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
TIMON:
other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.
Poet:
Nay, let's seek him
Poet:
Then do we sin against our own estate,
Poet:
When we may profit meet, and come too late.
Painter:
True,
Painter:
When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,
Painter:
Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.
TIMON:
[Aside]  I'll meet you at the turn. What a
TIMON:
god's gold,
TIMON:
That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
TIMON:
Than where swine feed!
TIMON:
'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
TIMON:
Settlest admired reverence in a slave
TIMON:
To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
TIMON:
Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!
TIMON:
Fit I meet them.
TIMON:
Coming forward
Poet:
Hail, worthy Timon!
Painter:
Our late noble master!
TIMON:
Have I once lived to see two honest men?
Poet:
Sir,
Poet:
Having often of your open bounty tasted,
Poet:
Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,
Poet:
Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!--
Poet:
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough
Poet:
What! to you,
Poet:
Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
Poet:
To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover
Poet:
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
Poet:
With any size of words.
TIMON:
Let it go naked, men may see't the better
TIMON:
You that are honest, by being what you are,
TIMON:
Make them best seen and known.
Painter:
He and myself
Painter:
Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,
Painter:
And sweetly felt it.
TIMON:
Ay, you are honest men.
Painter:
We are hither come to offer you our service.
TIMON:
Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
TIMON:
Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.
Both:
What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.
TIMON:
Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold,
TIMON:
I am sure you have: speak truth, ye're honest men.
Painter:
So it is said, my noble lord, but therefore
Painter:
Came not my friend nor I.
TIMON:
Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
TIMON:
Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best,
TIMON:
Thou counterfeit'st most lively.
Painter:
So, so, my lord.
TIMON:
E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,
TIMON:
Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
TIMON:
That thou art even natural in thine art.
TIMON:
But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,
TIMON:
I must needs say you have a little fault
TIMON:
Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
TIMON:
You take much pains to mend.
Both:
Beseech your honour
Both:
To make it known to us.
TIMON:
You'll take it ill.
Both:
Most thankfully, my lord.
TIMON:
Will you, indeed?
Both:
Doubt it not, worthy lord.
TIMON:
There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,
TIMON:
That mightily deceives you.
Both:
Do we, my lord?
TIMON:
Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
TIMON:
Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
TIMON:
Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured
TIMON:
That he's a made-up villain.
Painter:
I know none such, my lord.
Poet:
Nor I.
TIMON:
Look you, I love you well, I'll give you gold,
TIMON:
Rid me these villains from your companies
TIMON:
Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
TIMON:
Confound them by some course, and come to me,
TIMON:
I'll give you gold enough.
Both:
Name them, my lord, let's know them.
TIMON:
You that way and you this, but two in company,
TIMON:
Each man apart, all single and alone,
TIMON:
Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
TIMON:
If where thou art two villains shall not be,
TIMON:
Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside
TIMON:
But where one villain is, then him abandon.
TIMON:
Hence, pack! there's gold, you came for gold, ye slaves
TIMON:
To Painter
TIMON:
You have work'd for me, there's payment for you: hence!
TIMON:
To Poet
TIMON:
You are an alchemist, make gold of that.
TIMON:
Out, rascal dogs!
TIMON:
Beats them out, and then retires to his cave
TIMON:
Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators
FLAVIUS:
It is in vain that you would speak with Timon,
FLAVIUS:
For he is set so only to himself
FLAVIUS:
That nothing but himself which looks like man
FLAVIUS:
Is friendly with him.
First Senator:
Bring us to his cave
First Senator:
It is our part and promise to the Athenians
First Senator:
To speak with Timon.
Second Senator:
At all times alike
Second Senator:
Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
Second Senator:
That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,
Second Senator:
Offering the fortunes of his former days,
Second Senator:
The former man may make him. Bring us to him,
Second Senator:
And chance it as it may.
FLAVIUS:
Here is his cave.
FLAVIUS:
Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
FLAVIUS:
Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,
FLAVIUS:
By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee
FLAVIUS:
Speak to them, noble Timon.
FLAVIUS:
TIMON comes from his cave
TIMON:
Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and
TIMON:
be hang'd
TIMON:
For each true word, a blister! and each false
TIMON:
Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,
TIMON:
Consuming it with speaking!
First Senator:
Worthy Timon,--
TIMON:
Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.
First Senator:
The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.
TIMON:
I thank them, and would send them back the plague,
TIMON:
Could I but catch it for them.
First Senator:
O, forget
First Senator:
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
First Senator:
The senators with one consent of love
First Senator:
Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought
First Senator:
On special dignities, which vacant lie
First Senator:
For thy best use and wearing.
Second Senator:
They confess
Second Senator:
Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross
Second Senator:
Which now the public body, which doth seldom
Second Senator:
Play the recanter, feeling in itself
Second Senator:
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
Second Senator:
Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon,
Second Senator:
And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,
Second Senator:
Together with a recompense more fruitful
Second Senator:
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram,
Second Senator:
Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
Second Senator:
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
Second Senator:
And write in thee the figures of their love,
Second Senator:
Ever to read them thine.
TIMON:
You witch me in it,
TIMON:
Surprise me to the very brink of tears
TIMON:
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
TIMON:
And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.
First Senator:
Therefore, so please thee to return with us
First Senator:
And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
First Senator:
The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
First Senator:
Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
First Senator:
Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
First Senator:
Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
First Senator:
Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
First Senator:
His country's peace.
Second Senator:
And shakes his threatening sword
Second Senator:
Against the walls of Athens.
First Senator:
Therefore, Timon,--
TIMON:
Well, sir, I will, therefore, I will, sir, thus
TIMON:
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
TIMON:
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
TIMON:
That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,
TIMON:
And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
TIMON:
Giving our holy virgins to the stain
TIMON:
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,
TIMON:
Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
TIMON:
In pity of our aged and our youth,
TIMON:
I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
TIMON:
And let him take't at worst, for their knives care not,
TIMON:
While you have throats to answer: for myself,
TIMON:
There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
TIMON:
But I do prize it at my love before
TIMON:
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
TIMON:
To the protection of the prosperous gods,
TIMON:
As thieves to keepers.
FLAVIUS:
Stay not, all's in vain.
TIMON:
Why, I was writing of my epitaph,
TIMON:
it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
TIMON:
Of health and living now begins to mend,
TIMON:
And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still,
TIMON:
Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
TIMON:
And last so long enough!
First Senator:
We speak in vain.
TIMON:
But yet I love my country, and am not
TIMON:
One that rejoices in the common wreck,
TIMON:
As common bruit doth put it.
First Senator:
That's well spoke.
TIMON:
Commend me to my loving countrymen,--
First Senator:
These words become your lips as they pass
First Senator:
thorough them.
Second Senator:
And enter in our ears like great triumphers
Second Senator:
In their applauding gates.
TIMON:
Commend me to them,
TIMON:
And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
TIMON:
Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
TIMON:
Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
TIMON:
That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
TIMON:
In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them
TIMON:
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.
First Senator:
I like this well, he will return again.
TIMON:
I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
TIMON:
That mine own use invites me to cut down,
TIMON:
And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,
TIMON:
Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree
TIMON:
From high to low throughout, that whoso please
TIMON:
To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
TIMON:
Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
TIMON:
And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.
FLAVIUS:
Trouble him no further, thus you still shall find him.
TIMON:
Come not to me again: but say to Athens,
TIMON:
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
TIMON:
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood,
TIMON:
Who once a day with his embossed froth
TIMON:
The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
TIMON:
And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
TIMON:
Lips, let sour words go by and language end
TIMON:
What is amiss plague and infection mend!
TIMON:
Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
TIMON:
Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.
TIMON:
Retires to his cave
First Senator:
His discontents are unremoveably
First Senator:
Coupled to nature.
Second Senator:
Our hope in him is dead: let us return,
Second Senator:
And strain what other means is left unto us
Second Senator:
In our dear peril.
First Senator:
It requires swift foot.
First Senator:
Exeunt
First Senator:
SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens.
First Senator:
Enter two Senators and a Messenger
First Senator:
Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
First Senator:
As full as thy report?
Messenger:
have spoke the least
Messenger:
Besides, his expedition promises
Messenger:
Present approach.
Second Senator:
We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.
Messenger:
I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,
Messenger:
Whom, though in general part we were opposed,
Messenger:
Yet our old love made a particular force,
Messenger:
And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
Messenger:
From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
Messenger:
With letters of entreaty, which imported
Messenger:
His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
Messenger:
In part for his sake moved.
First Senator:
Here come our brothers.
First Senator:
Enter the Senators from TIMON
Third Senator:
No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
Third Senator:
The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring
Third Senator:
Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare
Third Senator:
Ours is the fall, I fear, our foes the snare.
Third Senator:
Exeunt
Third Senator:
SCENE III. The woods. Timon's cave, and a rude tomb seen.
Third Senator:
Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON
Soldier:
By all description this should be the place.
Soldier:
Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?
Soldier:
Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span
Soldier:
Some beast rear'd this, there does not live a man.
Soldier:
Dead, sure, and this his grave. What's on this tomb
Soldier:
I cannot read, the character I'll take with wax
Soldier:
Our captain hath in every figure skill,
Soldier:
An aged interpreter, though young in days
Soldier:
Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
Soldier:
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.
Soldier:
Exit
Soldier:
SCENE IV. Before the walls of Athens.
Soldier:
Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers
ALCIBIADES:
Sound to this coward and lascivious town
ALCIBIADES:
Our terrible approach.
ALCIBIADES:
A parley sounded
ALCIBIADES:
Enter Senators on the walls
ALCIBIADES:
Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
ALCIBIADES:
With all licentious measure, making your wills
ALCIBIADES:
The scope of justice, till now myself and such
ALCIBIADES:
As slept within the shadow of your power
ALCIBIADES:
Hav e wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
ALCIBIADES:
Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,
ALCIBIADES:
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
ALCIBIADES:
Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong
ALCIBIADES:
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
ALCIBIADES:
And pursy insolence shall break his wind
ALCIBIADES:
With fear and horrid flight.
First Senator:
Noble and young,
First Senator:
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
First Senator:
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
First Senator:
We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
First Senator:
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
First Senator:
Above their quantity.
Second Senator:
So did we woo
Second Senator:
Transformed Timon to our city's love
Second Senator:
By humble message and by promised means
Second Senator:
We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
Second Senator:
The common stroke of war.
First Senator:
These walls of ours
First Senator:
Were not erected by their hands from whom
First Senator:
You have received your griefs, nor are they such
First Senator:
That these great towers, trophies and schools
First Senator:
should fall
First Senator:
For private faults in them.
Second Senator:
Nor are they living
Second Senator:
Who were the motives that you first went out,
Second Senator:
Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess
Second Senator:
Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
Second Senator:
Into our city with thy banners spread
Second Senator:
By decimation, and a tithed death--
Second Senator:
If thy revenges hunger for that food
Second Senator:
Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,
Second Senator:
And by the hazard of the spotted die
Second Senator:
Let die the spotted.
First Senator:
All have not offended,
First Senator:
For those that were, it is not square to take
First Senator:
On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
First Senator:
Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
First Senator:
Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage
First Senator:
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
First Senator:
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
First Senator:
With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
First Senator:
Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,
First Senator:
But kill not all together.
Second Senator:
What thou wilt,
Second Senator:
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
Second Senator:
Than hew to't with thy sword.
First Senator:
Set but thy foot
First Senator:
Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope,
First Senator:
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
First Senator:
To say thou'lt enter friendly.
Second Senator:
Throw thy glove,
Second Senator:
Or any token of thine honour else,
Second Senator:
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
Second Senator:
And not as our confusion, all thy powers
Second Senator:
Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
Second Senator:
Have seal'd thy full desire.
ALCIBIADES:
Then there's my glove,
ALCIBIADES:
Descend, and open your uncharged ports
ALCIBIADES:
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
ALCIBIADES:
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
ALCIBIADES:
Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears
ALCIBIADES:
With my more noble meaning, not a man
ALCIBIADES:
Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
ALCIBIADES:
Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
ALCIBIADES:
But shall be render'd to your public laws
ALCIBIADES:
At heaviest answer.
Both:
'Tis most nobly spoken.
ALCIBIADES:
Descend, and keep your words.
ALCIBIADES:
The Senators descend, and open the gates
ALCIBIADES:
Enter Soldier
Soldier:
My noble general, Timon is dead,
Soldier:
Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea,
Soldier:
And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
Soldier:
With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
Soldier:
Interprets for my poor ignorance.
ALCIBIADES:
[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies a
ALCIBIADES:
wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft
ALCIBIADES:
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
ALCIBIADES:
caitiffs left!
ALCIBIADES:
Here lie I, Timon, who, alive, all living men did hate
ALCIBIADES:
Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay
ALCIBIADES:
not here thy gait.'
ALCIBIADES:
These well express in thee thy latter spirits
ALCIBIADES:
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
ALCIBIADES:
Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
ALCIBIADES:
droplets which
ALCIBIADES:
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
ALCIBIADES:
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
ALCIBIADES:
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
ALCIBIADES:
Is noble Timon: of whose memory
ALCIBIADES:
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
ALCIBIADES:
And I will use the olive with my sword,
ALCIBIADES:
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
ALCIBIADES:
Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
ALCIBIADES:
Let our drums strike.
ALCIBIADES:
Exeunt
