ACT I
LODOVICO:
PROLOGUE
LODOVICO:
Enter GOWER
LODOVICO:
Before the palace of Antioch
LODOVICO:
To sing a song that old was sung,
LODOVICO:
From ashes ancient Gower is come,
LODOVICO:
Assuming man's infirmities,
LODOVICO:
To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
LODOVICO:
It hath been sung at festivals,
LODOVICO:
On ember-eves and holy-ales,
LODOVICO:
And lords and ladies in their lives
LODOVICO:
Have read it for restoratives
LODOVICO:
The purchase is to make men glorious,
LODOVICO:
Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
LODOVICO:
If you, born in these latter times,
LODOVICO:
When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.
LODOVICO:
And that to hear an old man sing
LODOVICO:
May to your wishes pleasure bring
LODOVICO:
I life would wish, and that I might
LODOVICO:
Waste it for you, like taper-light.
LODOVICO:
This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
LODOVICO:
Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat
LODOVICO:
The fairest in all Syria,
LODOVICO:
I tell you what mine authors say
LODOVICO:
This king unto him took a fere,
LODOVICO:
Who died and left a female heir,
LODOVICO:
So buxom, blithe, and full of face,
LODOVICO:
As heaven had lent her all his grace,
LODOVICO:
With whom the father liking took,
LODOVICO:
And her to incest did provoke
LODOVICO:
Bad child, worse father! to entice his own
LODOVICO:
To evil should be done by none
LODOVICO:
But custom what they did begin
LODOVICO:
Was with long use account no sin.
LODOVICO:
The beauty of this sinful dame
LODOVICO:
Made many princes thither frame,
LODOVICO:
To seek her as a bed-fellow,
LODOVICO:
In marriage-pleasures play-fellow
LODOVICO:
Which to prevent he made a law,
LODOVICO:
To keep her still, and men in awe,
LODOVICO:
That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
LODOVICO:
His riddle told not, lost his life
LODOVICO:
So for her many a wight did die,
LODOVICO:
As yon grim looks do testify.
LODOVICO:
What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
LODOVICO:
I give, my cause who best can justify.
LODOVICO:
Exit
LODOVICO:
SCENE I. Antioch. A room in the palace.
LODOVICO:
Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers
ANTIOCHUS:
Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
ANTIOCHUS:
The danger of the task you undertake.
PERICLES:
I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
PERICLES:
Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
PERICLES:
Think death no hazard in this enterprise.
ANTIOCHUS:
Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
ANTIOCHUS:
For the embracements even of Jove himself,
ANTIOCHUS:
At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
ANTIOCHUS:
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
ANTIOCHUS:
The senate-house of planets all did sit,
ANTIOCHUS:
To knit in her their best perfections.
ANTIOCHUS:
Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
PERICLES:
See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
PERICLES:
Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
PERICLES:
Of every virtue gives renown to men!
PERICLES:
Her face the book of praises, where is read
PERICLES:
Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
PERICLES:
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
PERICLES:
Could never be her mild companion.
PERICLES:
You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
PERICLES:
That have inflamed desire in my breast
PERICLES:
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,
PERICLES:
Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
PERICLES:
As I am son and servant to your will,
PERICLES:
To compass such a boundless happiness!
ANTIOCHUS:
Prince Pericles,--
PERICLES:
That would be son to great Antiochus.
ANTIOCHUS:
Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
ANTIOCHUS:
With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd,
ANTIOCHUS:
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard
ANTIOCHUS:
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
ANTIOCHUS:
Her countless glory, which desert must gain,
ANTIOCHUS:
And which, without desert, because thine eye
ANTIOCHUS:
Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
ANTIOCHUS:
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
ANTIOCHUS:
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
ANTIOCHUS:
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
ANTIOCHUS:
That without covering, save yon field of stars,
ANTIOCHUS:
Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars,
ANTIOCHUS:
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
ANTIOCHUS:
For going on death's net, whom none resist.
PERICLES:
Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
PERICLES:
My frail mortality to know itself,
PERICLES:
And by those fearful objects to prepare
PERICLES:
This body, like to them, to what I must,
PERICLES:
For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
PERICLES:
Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
PERICLES:
I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
PERICLES:
Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
PERICLES:
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did,
PERICLES:
So I bequeath a happy peace to you
PERICLES:
And all good men, as every prince should do,
PERICLES:
My riches to the earth from whence they came,
PERICLES:
But my unspotted fire of love to you.
PERICLES:
To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
PERICLES:
Thus ready for the way of life or death,
PERICLES:
I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.
ANTIOCHUS:
Scorning advice, read the conclusion then
ANTIOCHUS:
Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
ANTIOCHUS:
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.
Daughter:
Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
Daughter:
Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!
PERICLES:
Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
PERICLES:
Nor ask advice of any other thought
PERICLES:
But faithfulness and courage.
PERICLES:
He reads the riddle
PERICLES:
I am no viper, yet I feed
PERICLES:
On mother's flesh which did me breed.
PERICLES:
I sought a husband, in which labour
PERICLES:
I found that kindness in a father
PERICLES:
He's father, son, and husband mild,
PERICLES:
I mother, wife, and yet his child.
PERICLES:
How they may be, and yet in two,
PERICLES:
As you will live, resolve it you.
PERICLES:
Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers
PERICLES:
That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
PERICLES:
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
PERICLES:
If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
PERICLES:
Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,
PERICLES:
Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
PERICLES:
Were not this glorious casket stored with ill
PERICLES:
But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt
PERICLES:
For he's no man on whom perfections wait
PERICLES:
That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
PERICLES:
You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings,
PERICLES:
Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,
PERICLES:
Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken
PERICLES:
But being play'd upon before your time,
PERICLES:
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
PERICLES:
Good sooth, I care not for you.
ANTIOCHUS:
Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
ANTIOCHUS:
For that's an article within our law,
ANTIOCHUS:
As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired
ANTIOCHUS:
Either expound now, or receive your sentence.
PERICLES:
Great king,
PERICLES:
Few love to hear the sins they love to act,
PERICLES:
'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
PERICLES:
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
PERICLES:
He's more secure to keep it shut than shown
PERICLES:
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.
PERICLES:
Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself,
PERICLES:
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
PERICLES:
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
PERICLES:
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
PERICLES:
Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
PERICLES:
By man's oppression, and the poor worm doth die for't.
PERICLES:
Kings are earth's gods, in vice their law's
PERICLES:
their will,
PERICLES:
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
PERICLES:
It is enough you know, and it is fit,
PERICLES:
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
PERICLES:
All love the womb that their first being bred,
PERICLES:
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
ANTIOCHUS:
[Aside]  Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found
ANTIOCHUS:
the meaning
ANTIOCHUS:
But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,
ANTIOCHUS:
Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
ANTIOCHUS:
Your exposition misinterpreting,
ANTIOCHUS:
We might proceed to cancel of your days,
ANTIOCHUS:
Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
ANTIOCHUS:
As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise
ANTIOCHUS:
Forty days longer we do respite you,
ANTIOCHUS:
If by which time our secret be undone,
ANTIOCHUS:
This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son
ANTIOCHUS:
And until then your entertain shall be
ANTIOCHUS:
As doth befit our honour and your worth.
ANTIOCHUS:
Exeunt all but PERICLES
PERICLES:
How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
PERICLES:
When what is done is like an hypocrite,
PERICLES:
The which is good in nothing but in sight!
PERICLES:
If it be true that I interpret false,
PERICLES:
Then were it certain you were not so bad
PERICLES:
As with foul incest to abuse your soul,
PERICLES:
Where now you're both a father and a son,
PERICLES:
By your untimely claspings with your child,
PERICLES:
Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father,
PERICLES:
And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
PERICLES:
By the defiling of her parent's bed,
PERICLES:
And both like serpents are, who though they feed
PERICLES:
On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
PERICLES:
Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
PERICLES:
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
PERICLES:
Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
PERICLES:
One sin, I know, another doth provoke,
PERICLES:
Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke
PERICLES:
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
PERICLES:
Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame
PERICLES:
Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,
PERICLES:
By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.
PERICLES:
Exit
PERICLES:
Re-enter ANTIOCHUS
ANTIOCHUS:
He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
ANTIOCHUS:
To have his head.
ANTIOCHUS:
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
ANTIOCHUS:
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
ANTIOCHUS:
In such a loathed manner,
ANTIOCHUS:
And therefore instantly this prince must die
ANTIOCHUS:
For by his fall my honour must keep high.
ANTIOCHUS:
Who attends us there?
ANTIOCHUS:
Enter THALIARD
THALIARD:
Doth your highness call?
ANTIOCHUS:
Thaliard,
ANTIOCHUS:
You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes
ANTIOCHUS:
Her private actions to your secrecy,
ANTIOCHUS:
And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
ANTIOCHUS:
Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold,
ANTIOCHUS:
We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him
ANTIOCHUS:
It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
ANTIOCHUS:
Because we bid it. Say, is it done?
THALIARD:
My lord,
THALIARD:
'Tis done.
ANTIOCHUS:
Enough.
ANTIOCHUS:
Enter a Messenger
ANTIOCHUS:
Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
Messenger:
My lord, prince Pericles is fled.
Messenger:
Exit
ANTIOCHUS:
As thou
ANTIOCHUS:
Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot
ANTIOCHUS:
From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
ANTIOCHUS:
His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return
ANTIOCHUS:
Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'
THALIARD:
My lord,
THALIARD:
If I can get him within my pistol's length,
THALIARD:
I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.
ANTIOCHUS:
Thaliard, adieu!
ANTIOCHUS:
Exit THALIARD
ANTIOCHUS:
Till Pericles be dead,
ANTIOCHUS:
My heart can lend no succor to my head.
ANTIOCHUS:
Exit
ANTIOCHUS:
SCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace.
ANTIOCHUS:
Enter PERICLES
PERICLES:
[To Lords without]  Let none disturb us.--Why should
PERICLES:
this change of thoughts,
PERICLES:
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
PERICLES:
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
PERICLES:
In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
PERICLES:
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
PERICLES:
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
PERICLES:
And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,
PERICLES:
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here
PERICLES:
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
PERICLES:
Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
PERICLES:
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
PERICLES:
That have their first conception by mis-dread,
PERICLES:
Have after-nourishment and life by care,
PERICLES:
And what was first but fear what might be done,
PERICLES:
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
PERICLES:
And so with me: the great Antiochus,
PERICLES:
'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
PERICLES:
Since he's so great can make his will his act,
PERICLES:
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence,
PERICLES:
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
PERICLES:
If he suspect I may dishonour him
PERICLES:
And what may make him blush in being known,
PERICLES:
He'll stop the course by which it might be known,
PERICLES:
With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
PERICLES:
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
PERICLES:
Amazement shall drive courage from the state,
PERICLES:
Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
PERICLES:
And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence
PERICLES:
Which care of them, not pity of myself,
PERICLES:
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
PERICLES:
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
PERICLES:
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
PERICLES:
And punish that before that he would punish.
PERICLES:
Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords
First Lord:
Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!
Second Lord:
And keep your mind, till you return to us,
Second Lord:
Peaceful and comfortable!
HELICANUS:
Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
HELICANUS:
They do abuse the king that flatter him
HELICANUS:
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin,
HELICANUS:
The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,
HELICANUS:
To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing,
HELICANUS:
Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
HELICANUS:
Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
HELICANUS:
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
HELICANUS:
He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
HELICANUS:
Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please,
HELICANUS:
I cannot be much lower than my knees.
PERICLES:
All leave us else, but let your cares o'erlook
PERICLES:
What shipping and what lading's in our haven,
PERICLES:
And then return to us.
PERICLES:
Exeunt Lords
PERICLES:
Helicanus, thou
PERICLES:
Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?
HELICANUS:
An angry brow, dread lord.
PERICLES:
If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
PERICLES:
How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?
HELICANUS:
How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence
HELICANUS:
They have their nourishment?
PERICLES:
Thou know'st I have power
PERICLES:
To take thy life from thee.
HELICANUS:
[Kneeling]
HELICANUS:
I have ground the axe myself,
HELICANUS:
Do you but strike the blow.
PERICLES:
Rise, prithee, rise.
PERICLES:
Sit down: thou art no flatterer
PERICLES:
I thank thee for it, and heaven forbid
PERICLES:
That kings should let their ears hear their
PERICLES:
faults hid!
PERICLES:
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
PERICLES:
Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,
PERICLES:
What wouldst thou have me do?
HELICANUS:
To bear with patience
HELICANUS:
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
PERICLES:
Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
PERICLES:
That minister'st a potion unto me
PERICLES:
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
PERICLES:
Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
PERICLES:
Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,
PERICLES:
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
PERICLES:
From whence an issue I might propagate,
PERICLES:
Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
PERICLES:
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder,
PERICLES:
The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest
PERICLES:
Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
PERICLES:
Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou
PERICLES:
know'st this,
PERICLES:
'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
PERICLES:
Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
PERICLES:
Under the covering of a careful night,
PERICLES:
Who seem'd my good protector, and, being here,
PERICLES:
Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
PERICLES:
I knew him tyrannous, and tyrants' fears
PERICLES:
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years
PERICLES:
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
PERICLES:
That I should open to the listening air
PERICLES:
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
PERICLES:
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
PERICLES:
To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,
PERICLES:
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him
PERICLES:
When all, for mine, if I may call offence,
PERICLES:
Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence
PERICLES:
Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
PERICLES:
Who now reprovest me for it,--
HELICANUS:
Alas, sir!
PERICLES:
Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
PERICLES:
Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
PERICLES:
How I might stop this tempest ere it came,
PERICLES:
And finding little comfort to relieve them,
PERICLES:
I thought it princely charity to grieve them.
HELICANUS:
Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.
HELICANUS:
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
HELICANUS:
And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
HELICANUS:
Who either by public war or private treason
HELICANUS:
Will take away your life.
HELICANUS:
Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
HELICANUS:
Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
HELICANUS:
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
HELICANUS:
Your rule direct to any, if to me.
HELICANUS:
Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.
PERICLES:
I do not doubt thy faith,
PERICLES:
But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?
HELICANUS:
We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
HELICANUS:
From whence we had our being and our birth.
PERICLES:
Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus
PERICLES:
Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee,
PERICLES:
And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
PERICLES:
The care I had and have of subjects' good
PERICLES:
On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
PERICLES:
I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath
PERICLES:
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both
PERICLES:
But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,
PERICLES:
That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
PERICLES:
Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.
PERICLES:
Exeunt
PERICLES:
SCENE III. Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace.
PERICLES:
Enter THALIARD
THALIARD:
So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I
THALIARD:
kill King Pericles, and if I do it not, I am sure to
THALIARD:
be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive
THALIARD:
he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,
THALIARD:
being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired
THALIARD:
he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he
THALIARD:
had some reason for't, for if a king bid a man be a
THALIARD:
villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to
THALIARD:
be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.
THALIARD:
Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre
HELICANUS:
You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
HELICANUS:
Further to question me of your king's departure
HELICANUS:
His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,
HELICANUS:
Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.
THALIARD:
[Aside]  How! the king gone!
HELICANUS:
If further yet you will be satisfied,
HELICANUS:
Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,
HELICANUS:
He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.
HELICANUS:
Being at Antioch--
THALIARD:
[Aside]          What from Antioch?
HELICANUS:
Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--
HELICANUS:
Took some displeasure at him, at least he judged so
HELICANUS:
And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
HELICANUS:
To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself,
HELICANUS:
So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
HELICANUS:
With whom each minute threatens life or death.
THALIARD:
[Aside]  Well, I perceive
THALIARD:
I shall not be hang'd now, although I would,
THALIARD:
But since he's gone, the king's seas must please
THALIARD:
He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.
THALIARD:
I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!
HELICANUS:
Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.
THALIARD:
From him I come
THALIARD:
With message unto princely Pericles,
THALIARD:
But since my landing I have understood
THALIARD:
Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,
THALIARD:
My message must return from whence it came.
HELICANUS:
We have no reason to desire it,
HELICANUS:
Commended to our master, not to us
HELICANUS:
Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
HELICANUS:
As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.
HELICANUS:
Exeunt
HELICANUS:
SCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.
HELICANUS:
Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA, and others
CLEON:
My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
CLEON:
And by relating tales of others' griefs,
CLEON:
See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
DIONYZA:
That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it,
DIONYZA:
For who digs hills because they do aspire
DIONYZA:
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
DIONYZA:
O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are,
DIONYZA:
Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
DIONYZA:
But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.
CLEON:
O Dionyza,
CLEON:
Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
CLEON:
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
CLEON:
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
CLEON:
Our woes into the air, our eyes do weep,
CLEON:
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder,
CLEON:
That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
CLEON:
They may awake their helps to comfort them.
CLEON:
I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
CLEON:
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.
DIONYZA:
I'll do my best, sir.
CLEON:
This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
CLEON:
A city on whom plenty held full hand,
CLEON:
For riches strew'd herself even in the streets,
CLEON:
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
CLEON:
And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at,
CLEON:
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
CLEON:
Like one another's glass to trim them by
CLEON:
Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
CLEON:
And not so much to feed on as delight,
CLEON:
All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
CLEON:
The name of help grew odious to repeat.
DIONYZA:
O, 'tis too true.
CLEON:
But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
CLEON:
These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
CLEON:
Were all too little to content and please,
CLEON:
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
CLEON:
As houses are defiled for want of use,
CLEON:
They are now starved for want of exercise
CLEON:
Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
CLEON:
Must have inventions to delight the taste,
CLEON:
Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it
CLEON:
Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
CLEON:
Thought nought too curious, are ready now
CLEON:
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
CLEON:
So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
CLEON:
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life
CLEON:
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping,
CLEON:
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
CLEON:
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
CLEON:
Is not this true?
DIONYZA:
Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
CLEON:
O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
CLEON:
And her prosperities so largely taste,
CLEON:
With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
CLEON:
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
CLEON:
Enter a Lord
Lord:
Where's the lord governor?
CLEON:
Here.
CLEON:
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
CLEON:
For comfort is too far for us to expect.
Lord:
We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,
Lord:
A portly sail of ships make hitherward.
CLEON:
I thought as much.
CLEON:
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,
CLEON:
That may succeed as his inheritor,
CLEON:
And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,
CLEON:
Taking advantage of our misery,
CLEON:
Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
CLEON:
To beat us down, the which are down already,
CLEON:
And make a conquest of unhappy me,
CLEON:
Whereas no glory's got to overcome.
Lord:
That's the least fear, for, by the semblance
Lord:
Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,
Lord:
And come to us as favourers, not as foes.
CLEON:
Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat
CLEON:
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
CLEON:
But bring they what they will and what they can,
CLEON:
What need we fear?
CLEON:
The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.
CLEON:
Go tell their general we attend him here,
CLEON:
To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
CLEON:
And what he craves.
Lord:
I go, my lord.
Lord:
Exit
CLEON:
Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist,
CLEON:
If wars, we are unable to resist.
CLEON:
Enter PERICLES with Attendants
PERICLES:
Lord governor, for so we hear you are,
PERICLES:
Let not our ships and number of our men
PERICLES:
Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.
PERICLES:
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,
PERICLES:
And seen the desolation of your streets
PERICLES:
Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
PERICLES:
But to relieve them of their heavy load,
PERICLES:
And these our ships, you happily may think
PERICLES:
Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
PERICLES:
With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,
PERICLES:
Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,
PERICLES:
And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.
All:
The gods of Greece protect you!
All:
And we'll pray for you.
PERICLES:
Arise, I pray you, rise
PERICLES:
We do not look for reverence, but to love,
PERICLES:
And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.
CLEON:
The which when any shall not gratify,
CLEON:
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
CLEON:
Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
CLEON:
The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
CLEON:
Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--
CLEON:
Your grace is welcome to our town and us.
PERICLES:
Which welcome we'll accept, feast here awhile,
PERICLES:
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.
PERICLES:
Exeunt
PERICLES:
ACT II
PERICLES:
Enter GOWER
GOWER:
Here have you seen a mighty king
GOWER:
His child, I wis, to incest bring,
GOWER:
A better prince and benign lord,
GOWER:
That will prove awful both in deed and word.
GOWER:
Be quiet then as men should be,
GOWER:
Till he hath pass'd necessity.
GOWER:
I'll show you those in troubles reign,
GOWER:
Losing a mite, a mountain gain.
GOWER:
The good in conversation,
GOWER:
To whom I give my benison,
GOWER:
Is still at Tarsus, where each man
GOWER:
Thinks all is writ he speken can,
GOWER:
And, to remember what he does,
GOWER:
Build his statue to make him glorious
GOWER:
But tidings to the contrary
GOWER:
Are brought your eyes, what need speak I?
GOWER:
DUMB SHOW.
GOWER:
Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON, all  the train with them. Enter at another door a  Gentleman, with a letter to PERICLES, PERICLES  shows the letter to CLEON, gives the Messenger a  reward, and knights him. Exit PERICLES at one door, and CLEON at another
GOWER:
Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,
GOWER:
Not to eat honey like a drone
GOWER:
From others' labours, for though he strive
GOWER:
To killen bad, keep good alive,
GOWER:
And to fulfil his prince' desire,
GOWER:
Sends word of all that haps in Tyre
GOWER:
How Thaliard came full bent with sin
GOWER:
And had intent to murder him,
GOWER:
And that in Tarsus was not best
GOWER:
Longer for him to make his rest.
GOWER:
He, doing so, put forth to seas,
GOWER:
Where when men been, there's seldom ease,
GOWER:
For now the wind begins to blow,
GOWER:
Thunder above and deeps below
GOWER:
Make such unquiet, that the ship
GOWER:
Should house him safe is wreck'd and split,
GOWER:
And he, good prince, having all lost,
GOWER:
By waves from coast to coast is tost
GOWER:
All perishen of man, of pelf,
GOWER:
Ne aught escapen but himself,
GOWER:
Till fortune, tired with doing bad,
GOWER:
Threw him ashore, to give him glad
GOWER:
And here he comes. What shall be next,
GOWER:
Pardon old Gower,--this longs the text.
GOWER:
Exit
GOWER:
SCENE I. Pentapolis. An open place by the sea-side.
GOWER:
Enter PERICLES, wet
PERICLES:
Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
PERICLES:
Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man
PERICLES:
Is but a substance that must yield to you,
PERICLES:
And I, as fits my nature, do obey you
PERICLES:
Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
PERICLES:
Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath
PERICLES:
Nothing to think on but ensuing death
PERICLES:
Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
PERICLES:
To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes,
PERICLES:
And having thrown him from your watery grave,
PERICLES:
Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
PERICLES:
Enter three FISHERMEN
First Fisherman:
What, ho, Pilch!
Second Fisherman:
Ha, come and bring away the nets!
First Fisherman:
What, Patch-breech, I say!
Third Fisherman:
What say you, master?
First Fisherman:
Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'll
First Fisherman:
fetch thee with a wanion.
Third Fisherman:
Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that
Third Fisherman:
were cast away before us even now.
First Fisherman:
Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what
First Fisherman:
pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,
First Fisherman:
well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.
Third Fisherman:
Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the
Third Fisherman:
porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say
Third Fisherman:
they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,
Third Fisherman:
they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I
Third Fisherman:
marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
First Fisherman:
Why, as men do a-land, the great ones eat up the
First Fisherman:
little ones: I can compare our rich misers to
First Fisherman:
nothing so fitly as to a whale, a' plays and
First Fisherman:
tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at
First Fisherman:
last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales
First Fisherman:
have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping
First Fisherman:
till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,
First Fisherman:
steeple, bells, and all.
PERICLES:
[Aside]  A pretty moral.
Third Fisherman:
But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have
Third Fisherman:
been that day in the belfry.
Second Fisherman:
Why, man?
Third Fisherman:
Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I
Third Fisherman:
had been in his belly, I would have kept such a
Third Fisherman:
jangling of the bells, that he should never have
Third Fisherman:
left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and
Third Fisherman:
parish up again. But if the good King Simonides
Third Fisherman:
were of my mind,--
PERICLES:
[Aside]  Simonides!
Third Fisherman:
We would purge the land of these drones, that rob
Third Fisherman:
the bee of her honey.
PERICLES:
[Aside]  How from the finny subject of the sea
PERICLES:
These fishers tell the infirmities of men,
PERICLES:
And from their watery empire recollect
PERICLES:
All that may men approve or men detect!
PERICLES:
Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.
Second Fisherman:
Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a day
Second Fisherman:
fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody
Second Fisherman:
look after it.
PERICLES:
May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.
Second Fisherman:
What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
Second Fisherman:
way!
PERICLES:
A man whom both the waters and the wind,
PERICLES:
In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball
PERICLES:
For them to play upon, entreats you pity him
PERICLES:
He asks of you, that never used to beg.
First Fisherman:
No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in our
First Fisherman:
country Greece gets more with begging than we can do
First Fisherman:
with working.
Second Fisherman:
Canst thou catch any fishes, then?
PERICLES:
I never practised it.
Second Fisherman:
Nay, then thou wilt starve, sure, for here's nothing
Second Fisherman:
to be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for't.
PERICLES:
What I have been I have forgot to know,
PERICLES:
But what I am, want teaches me to think on
PERICLES:
A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,
PERICLES:
And have no more of life than may suffice
PERICLES:
To give my tongue that heat to ask your help,
PERICLES:
Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,
PERICLES:
For that I am a man, pray see me buried.
First Fisherman:
Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here,
First Fisherman:
come, put it on, keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a
First Fisherman:
handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and
First Fisherman:
we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for
First Fisherman:
fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,
First Fisherman:
and thou shalt be welcome.
PERICLES:
I thank you, sir.
Second Fisherman:
Hark you, my friend, you said you could not beg.
PERICLES:
I did but crave.
Second Fisherman:
But crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so I
Second Fisherman:
shall 'scape whipping.
PERICLES:
Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?
Second Fisherman:
O, not all, my friend, not all, for if all your
Second Fisherman:
beggars were whipped, I would wish no better office
Second Fisherman:
than to be beadle. But, master, I'll go draw up the
Second Fisherman:
net.
Second Fisherman:
Exit with Third Fisherman
PERICLES:
[Aside]  How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!
First Fisherman:
Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?
PERICLES:
Not well.
First Fisherman:
Why, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and
First Fisherman:
our king the good Simonides.
PERICLES:
The good King Simonides, do you call him.
First Fisherman:
Ay, sir, and he deserves so to be called for his
First Fisherman:
peaceable reign and good government.
PERICLES:
He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects
PERICLES:
the name of good by his government. How far is his
PERICLES:
court distant from this shore?
First Fisherman:
Marry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tell
First Fisherman:
you, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is her
First Fisherman:
birth-day, and there are princes and knights come
First Fisherman:
from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.
PERICLES:
Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish
PERICLES:
to make one there.
First Fisherman:
O, sir, things must be as they may, and what a man
First Fisherman:
cannot get, he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.
First Fisherman:
Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen, drawing up a net
Second Fisherman:
Help, master, help! here's a fish hangs in the net,
Second Fisherman:
like a poor man's right in the law, 'twill hardly
Second Fisherman:
come out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and
Second Fisherman:
'tis turned to a rusty armour.
PERICLES:
An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.
PERICLES:
Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,
PERICLES:
Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself,
PERICLES:
And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,
PERICLES:
Which my dead father did bequeath to me.
PERICLES:
With this strict charge, even as he left his life,
PERICLES:
'Keep it, my Pericles, it hath been a shield
PERICLES:
Twixt me and death,'--and pointed to this brace,--
PERICLES:
'For that it saved me, keep it, in like necessity--
PERICLES:
The which the gods protect thee from!--may
PERICLES:
defend thee.'
PERICLES:
It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it,
PERICLES:
Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,
PERICLES:
Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again
PERICLES:
I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,
PERICLES:
Since I have here my father's gift in's will.
First Fisherman:
What mean you, sir?
PERICLES:
To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
PERICLES:
For it was sometime target to a king,
PERICLES:
I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
PERICLES:
And for his sake I wish the having of it,
PERICLES:
And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,
PERICLES:
Where with it I may appear a gentleman,
PERICLES:
And if that ever my low fortune's better,
PERICLES:
I'll pay your bounties, till then rest your debtor.
First Fisherman:
Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?
PERICLES:
I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.
First Fisherman:
Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!
Second Fisherman:
Ay, but hark you, my friend, 'twas we that made up
Second Fisherman:
this garment through the rough seams of the waters
Second Fisherman:
there are certain condolements, certain vails. I
Second Fisherman:
hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from
Second Fisherman:
whence you had it.
PERICLES:
Believe 't, I will.
PERICLES:
By your furtherance I am clothed in steel,
PERICLES:
And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,
PERICLES:
This jewel holds his building on my arm
PERICLES:
Unto thy value I will mount myself
PERICLES:
Upon a courser, whose delightful steps
PERICLES:
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
PERICLES:
Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided
PERICLES:
Of a pair of bases.
Second Fisherman:
We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to
Second Fisherman:
make thee a pair, and I'll bring thee to the court myself.
PERICLES:
Then honour be but a goal to my will,
PERICLES:
This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.
PERICLES:
Exeunt
PERICLES:
SCENE II. The same. A public way or platform leading to the
PERICLES:
lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the
PERICLES:
reception of King, Princess, Lords,  and c.
PERICLES:
Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, and Attendants
SIMONIDES:
Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?
First Lord:
They are, my liege,
First Lord:
And stay your coming to present themselves.
SIMONIDES:
Return them, we are ready, and our daughter,
SIMONIDES:
In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,
SIMONIDES:
Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat
SIMONIDES:
For men to see, and seeing wonder at.
SIMONIDES:
Exit a Lord
THAISA:
It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express
THAISA:
My commendations great, whose merit's less.
SIMONIDES:
It's fit it should be so, for princes are
SIMONIDES:
A model which heaven makes like to itself
SIMONIDES:
As jewels lose their glory if neglected,
SIMONIDES:
So princes their renowns if not respected.
SIMONIDES:
'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain
SIMONIDES:
The labour of each knight in his device.
THAISA:
Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.
THAISA:
Enter a Knight, he passes over, and his Squire presents his shield to the Princess
SIMONIDES:
Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
THAISA:
A knight of Sparta, my renowned father,
THAISA:
And the device he bears upon his shield
THAISA:
Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun
THAISA:
The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'
SIMONIDES:
He loves you well that holds his life of you.
SIMONIDES:
The Second Knight passes over
SIMONIDES:
Who is the second that presents himself?
THAISA:
A prince of Macedon, my royal father,
THAISA:
And the device he bears upon his shield
THAISA:
Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady,
THAISA:
The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'
THAISA:
The Third Knight passes over
SIMONIDES:
And what's the third?
THAISA:
The third of Antioch,
THAISA:
And his device, a wreath of chivalry,
THAISA:
The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'
THAISA:
The Fourth Knight passes over
SIMONIDES:
What is the fourth?
THAISA:
A burning torch that's turned upside down,
THAISA:
The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'
SIMONIDES:
Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
SIMONIDES:
Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
SIMONIDES:
The Fifth Knight passes over
THAISA:
The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,
THAISA:
Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried,
THAISA:
The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'
THAISA:
The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over
SIMONIDES:
And what's
SIMONIDES:
The sixth and last, the which the knight himself
SIMONIDES:
With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?
THAISA:
He seems to be a stranger, but his present is
THAISA:
A wither'd branch, that's only green at top,
THAISA:
The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'
SIMONIDES:
A pretty moral,
SIMONIDES:
From the dejected state wherein he is,
SIMONIDES:
He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.
First Lord:
He had need mean better than his outward show
First Lord:
Can any way speak in his just commend,
First Lord:
For by his rusty outside he appears
First Lord:
To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.
Second Lord:
He well may be a stranger, for he comes
Second Lord:
To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.
Third Lord:
And on set purpose let his armour rust
Third Lord:
Until this day, to scour it in the dust.
SIMONIDES:
Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
SIMONIDES:
The outward habit by the inward man.
SIMONIDES:
But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw
SIMONIDES:
Into the gallery.
SIMONIDES:
Exeunt
SIMONIDES:
Great shouts within and all cry 'The mean knight!'
SIMONIDES:
SCENE III. The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.
SIMONIDES:
Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and Knights, from tilting
SIMONIDES:
Knights,
SIMONIDES:
To say you're welcome were superfluous.
SIMONIDES:
To place upon the volume of your deeds,
SIMONIDES:
As in a title-page, your worth in arms,
SIMONIDES:
Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
SIMONIDES:
Since every worth in show commends itself.
SIMONIDES:
Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast
SIMONIDES:
You are princes and my guests.
THAISA:
But you, my knight and guest,
THAISA:
To whom this wreath of victory I give,
THAISA:
And crown you king of this day's happiness.
PERICLES:
'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.
SIMONIDES:
Call it by what you will, the day is yours,
SIMONIDES:
And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
SIMONIDES:
In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,
SIMONIDES:
To make some good, but others to exceed,
SIMONIDES:
And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'
SIMONIDES:
the feast,--
SIMONIDES:
For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place
SIMONIDES:
Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.
KNIGHTS:
We are honour'd much by good Simonides.
SIMONIDES:
Your presence glads our days: honour we love,
SIMONIDES:
For who hates honour hates the gods above.
Marshal:
Sir, yonder is your place.
PERICLES:
Some other is more fit.
First Knight:
Contend not, sir, for we are gentlemen
First Knight:
That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
First Knight:
Envy the great nor do the low despise.
PERICLES:
You are right courteous knights.
SIMONIDES:
Sit, sir, sit.
PERICLES:
By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,
PERICLES:
These cates resist me, she but thought upon.
THAISA:
By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
THAISA:
All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.
THAISA:
Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.
SIMONIDES:
He's but a country gentleman,
SIMONIDES:
Has done no more than other knights have done,
SIMONIDES:
Has broken a staff or so, so let it pass.
THAISA:
To me he seems like diamond to glass.
PERICLES:
Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,
PERICLES:
Which tells me in that glory once he was,
PERICLES:
Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,
PERICLES:
And he the sun, for them to reverence,
PERICLES:
None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
PERICLES:
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy
PERICLES:
Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,
PERICLES:
The which hath fire in darkness, none in light
PERICLES:
Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,
PERICLES:
He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
PERICLES:
And gives them what he will, not what they crave.
SIMONIDES:
What, are you merry, knights?
Knights:
Who can be other in this royal presence?
SIMONIDES:
Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
SIMONIDES:
As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--
SIMONIDES:
We drink this health to you.
KNIGHTS:
We thank your grace.
SIMONIDES:
Yet pause awhile
SIMONIDES:
Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
SIMONIDES:
As if the entertainment in our court
SIMONIDES:
Had not a show might countervail his worth.
SIMONIDES:
Note it not you, Thaisa?
THAISA:
What is it
THAISA:
To me, my father?
SIMONIDES:
O, attend, my daughter
SIMONIDES:
Princes in this should live like gods above,
SIMONIDES:
Who freely give to every one that comes
SIMONIDES:
To honour them
SIMONIDES:
And princes not doin g so are like to gnats,
SIMONIDES:
Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.
SIMONIDES:
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,
SIMONIDES:
Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.
THAISA:
Alas, my father, it befits not me
THAISA:
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold
THAISA:
He may my proffer take for an offence,
THAISA:
Since men take women's gifts for impudence.
SIMONIDES:
How!
SIMONIDES:
Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.
THAISA:
[Aside]  Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.
SIMONIDES:
And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,
SIMONIDES:
Of whence he is, his name and parentage.
THAISA:
The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.
PERICLES:
I thank him.
THAISA:
Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
PERICLES:
I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.
THAISA:
And further he desires to know of you,
THAISA:
Of whence you are, your name and parentage.
PERICLES:
A gentleman of Tyre, my name, Pericles,
PERICLES:
My education been in arts and arms,
PERICLES:
Who, looking for adventures in the world,
PERICLES:
Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
PERICLES:
And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.
THAISA:
He thanks your grace, names himself Pericles,
THAISA:
A gentleman of Tyre,
THAISA:
Who only by misfortune of the seas
THAISA:
Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.
SIMONIDES:
Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
SIMONIDES:
And will awake him from his melancholy.
SIMONIDES:
Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
SIMONIDES:
And waste the time, which looks for other revels.
SIMONIDES:
Even in your armours, as you are address'd,
SIMONIDES:
Will very well become a soldier's dance.
SIMONIDES:
I will not have excuse, with saying this
SIMONIDES:
Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
SIMONIDES:
Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
SIMONIDES:
The Knights dance
SIMONIDES:
So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.
SIMONIDES:
Come, sir,
SIMONIDES:
Here is a lady that wants breathing too
SIMONIDES:
And I have heard, you knights of Tyre
SIMONIDES:
Are excellent in making ladies trip,
SIMONIDES:
And that their measures are as excellent.
PERICLES:
In those that practise them they are, my lord.
SIMONIDES:
O, that's as much as you would be denied
SIMONIDES:
Of your fair courtesy.
SIMONIDES:
The Knights and Ladies dance
SIMONIDES:
Unclasp, unclasp
SIMONIDES:
Thanks, gentlemen, to all, all have done well.
SIMONIDES:
To PERICLES
SIMONIDES:
But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct
SIMONIDES:
These knights unto their several lodgings!
SIMONIDES:
To PERICLES
SIMONIDES:
Yours, sir,
SIMONIDES:
We have given order to be next our own.
PERICLES:
I am at your grace's pleasure.
SIMONIDES:
Princes, it is too late to talk of love,
SIMONIDES:
And that's the mark I know you level at
SIMONIDES:
Therefore each one betake him to his rest,
SIMONIDES:
To-morrow all for speeding do their best.
SIMONIDES:
Exeunt
SIMONIDES:
SCENE IV. Tyre. A room in the Governor's house.
SIMONIDES:
Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES
HELICANUS:
No, Escanes, know this of me,
HELICANUS:
Antiochus from incest lived not free
HELICANUS:
For which, the most high gods not minding longer
HELICANUS:
To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,
HELICANUS:
Due to this heinous capital offence,
HELICANUS:
Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
HELICANUS:
When he was seated in a chariot
HELICANUS:
Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
HELICANUS:
A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
HELICANUS:
Their bodies, even to loathing, for they so stunk,
HELICANUS:
That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
HELICANUS:
Scorn now their hand should give them burial.
ESCANES:
'Twas very strange.
HELICANUS:
And yet but justice, for though
HELICANUS:
This king were great, his greatness was no guard
HELICANUS:
To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.
ESCANES:
'Tis very true.
ESCANES:
Enter two or three Lords
First Lord:
See, not a man in private conference
First Lord:
Or council has respect with him but he.
Second Lord:
It shall no longer grieve without reproof.
Third Lord:
And cursed be he that will not second it.
First Lord:
Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.
HELICANUS:
With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.
First Lord:
Know that our griefs are risen to the top,
First Lord:
And now at length they overflow their banks.
HELICANUS:
Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.
First Lord:
Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane,
First Lord:
But if the prince do live, let us salute him,
First Lord:
Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
First Lord:
If in the world he live, we'll seek him out,
First Lord:
If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there,
First Lord:
And be resolved he lives to govern us,
First Lord:
Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,
First Lord:
And leave us to our free election.
Second Lord:
Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure
Second Lord:
And knowing this kingdom is without a head,--
Second Lord:
Like goodly buildings left without a roof
Second Lord:
Soon fall to ruin,--your noble self,
Second Lord:
That best know how to rule and how to reign,
Second Lord:
We thus submit unto,--our sovereign.
All:
Live, noble Helicane!
HELICANUS:
For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages
HELICANUS:
If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
HELICANUS:
Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
HELICANUS:
Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
HELICANUS:
A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to
HELICANUS:
Forbear the absence of your king
HELICANUS:
If in which time expired, he not return,
HELICANUS:
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
HELICANUS:
But if I cannot win you to this love,
HELICANUS:
Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
HELICANUS:
And in your search spend your adventurous worth,
HELICANUS:
Whom if you find, and win unto return,
HELICANUS:
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.
First Lord:
To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield,
First Lord:
And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,
First Lord:
We with our travels will endeavour us.
HELICANUS:
Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands
HELICANUS:
When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.
HELICANUS:
Exeunt
HELICANUS:
SCENE V. Pentapolis. A room in the palace.
HELICANUS:
Enter SIMONIDES, reading a letter, at one door: the Knights meet him
First Knight:
Good morrow to the good Simonides.
SIMONIDES:
Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
SIMONIDES:
That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
SIMONIDES:
A married life.
SIMONIDES:
Her reason to herself is only known,
SIMONIDES:
Which yet from her by no means can I get.
Second Knight:
May we not get access to her, my lord?
SIMONIDES:
'Faith, by no means, she has so strictly tied
SIMONIDES:
Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.
SIMONIDES:
One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery,
SIMONIDES:
This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd
SIMONIDES:
And on her virgin honour will not break it.
Third Knight:
Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.
Third Knight:
Exeunt Knights
SIMONIDES:
So,
SIMONIDES:
They are well dispatch'd, now to my daughter's letter
SIMONIDES:
She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,
SIMONIDES:
Or never more to view nor day nor light.
SIMONIDES:
'Tis well, mistress, your choice agrees with mine,
SIMONIDES:
I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,
SIMONIDES:
Not minding whether I dislike or no!
SIMONIDES:
Well, I do commend her choice,
SIMONIDES:
And will no longer have it be delay'd.
SIMONIDES:
Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.
SIMONIDES:
Enter PERICLES
PERICLES:
All fortune to the good Simonides!
SIMONIDES:
To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you
SIMONIDES:
For your sweet music this last night: I do
SIMONIDES:
Protest my ears were never better fed
SIMONIDES:
With such delightful pleasing harmony.
PERICLES:
It is your grace's pleasure to commend,
PERICLES:
Not my desert.
SIMONIDES:
Sir, you are music's master.
PERICLES:
The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.
SIMONIDES:
Let me ask you one thing
SIMONIDES:
What do you think of my daughter, sir?
PERICLES:
A most virtuous princess.
SIMONIDES:
And she is fair too, is she not?
PERICLES:
As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.
SIMONIDES:
Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you,
SIMONIDES:
Ay, so well, that you must be her master,
SIMONIDES:
And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.
PERICLES:
I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.
SIMONIDES:
She thinks not so, peruse this writing else.
PERICLES:
[Aside]  What's here?
PERICLES:
A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
PERICLES:
'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.
PERICLES:
O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
PERICLES:
A stranger and distressed gentleman,
PERICLES:
That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,
PERICLES:
But bent all offices to honour her.
SIMONIDES:
Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art
SIMONIDES:
A villain.
PERICLES:
By the gods, I have not
PERICLES:
Never did thought of mine levy offence,
PERICLES:
Nor never did my actions yet commence
PERICLES:
A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.
SIMONIDES:
Traitor, thou liest.
PERICLES:
Traitor!
SIMONIDES:
Ay, traitor.
PERICLES:
Even in his throat--unless it be the king--
PERICLES:
That calls me traitor, I return the lie.
SIMONIDES:
[Aside]  Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.
PERICLES:
My actions are as noble as my thoughts,
PERICLES:
That never relish'd of a base descent.
PERICLES:
I came unto your court for honour's cause,
PERICLES:
And not to be a rebel to her state,
PERICLES:
And he that otherwise accounts of me,
PERICLES:
This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.
SIMONIDES:
No?
SIMONIDES:
Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.
SIMONIDES:
Enter THAISA
PERICLES:
Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,
PERICLES:
Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
PERICLES:
Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe
PERICLES:
To any syllable that made love to you.
THAISA:
Why, sir, say if you had,
THAISA:
Who takes offence at that would make me glad?
SIMONIDES:
Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?
SIMONIDES:
Aside
SIMONIDES:
I am glad on't with all my heart.--
SIMONIDES:
I'll tame you, I'll bring you in subjection.
SIMONIDES:
Will you, not having my consent,
SIMONIDES:
Bestow your love and your affections
SIMONIDES:
Upon a stranger?
SIMONIDES:
Aside
SIMONIDES:
who, for aught I know,
SIMONIDES:
May be, nor can I think the contrary,
SIMONIDES:
As great in blood as I myself.--
SIMONIDES:
Therefore hear you, mistress, either frame
SIMONIDES:
Your will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,
SIMONIDES:
Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--
SIMONIDES:
Man and wife
SIMONIDES:
Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too
SIMONIDES:
And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy,
SIMONIDES:
And for a further grief,--God give you joy!--
SIMONIDES:
What, are you both pleased?
THAISA:
Yes, if you love me, sir.
PERICLES:
Even as my life, or blood that fosters it.
SIMONIDES:
What, are you both agreed?
BOTH:
Yes, if it please your majesty.
SIMONIDES:
It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed,
SIMONIDES:
And then with what haste you can get you to bed.
SIMONIDES:
Exeunt
SIMONIDES:
ACT III
SIMONIDES:
Enter GOWER
GOWER:
Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout,
GOWER:
No din but snores the house about,
GOWER:
Made louder by the o'er-fed breast
GOWER:
Of this most pompous marriage-feast.
GOWER:
The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
GOWER:
Now crouches fore the mouse's hole,
GOWER:
And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,
GOWER:
E'er the blither for their drouth.
GOWER:
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.
GOWER:
Where, by the loss of maidenhead,
GOWER:
A babe is moulded. Be attent,
GOWER:
And time that is so briefly spent
GOWER:
With your fine fancies quaintly eche
GOWER:
What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.
GOWER:
DUMB SHOW.
GOWER:
Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with  Attendants, a Messenger meets them, kneels, and  gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it  SIMONIDES, the Lords kneel to him. Then enter  THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The  KING shows her the letter, she rejoices: she and  PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with  LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest
GOWER:
By many a dern and painful perch
GOWER:
Of Pericles the careful search,
GOWER:
By the four opposing coigns
GOWER:
Which the world together joins,
GOWER:
Is made with all due diligence
GOWER:
That horse and sail and high expense
GOWER:
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
GOWER:
Fame answering the most strange inquire,
GOWER:
To the court of King Simonides
GOWER:
Are letters brought, the tenor these
GOWER:
Antiochus and his daughter dead,
GOWER:
The men of Tyrus on the head
GOWER:
Of Helicanus would set on
GOWER:
The crown of Tyre, but he will none
GOWER:
The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress,
GOWER:
Says to 'em, if King Pericles
GOWER:
Come not home in twice six moons,
GOWER:
He, obedient to their dooms,
GOWER:
Will take the crown. The sum of this,
GOWER:
Brought hither to Pentapolis,
GOWER:
Y-ravished the regions round,
GOWER:
And every one with claps can sound,
GOWER:
'Our heir-apparent is a king!
GOWER:
Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'
GOWER:
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre
GOWER:
His queen with child makes her desire--
GOWER:
Which who shall cross?--along to go
GOWER:
Omit we all their dole and woe
GOWER:
Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
GOWER:
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
GOWER:
On Neptune's billow, half the flood
GOWER:
Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood
GOWER:
Varies again, the grisly north
GOWER:
Disgorges such a tempest forth,
GOWER:
That, as a duck for life that dives,
GOWER:
So up and down the poor ship drives
GOWER:
The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
GOWER:
Does fall in travail with her fear
GOWER:
And what ensues in this fell storm
GOWER:
Shall for itself itself perform.
GOWER:
I nill relate, action may
GOWER:
Conveniently the rest convey,
GOWER:
Which might not what by me is told.
GOWER:
In your imagination hold
GOWER:
This stage the ship, upon whose deck
GOWER:
The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.
GOWER:
Exit
GOWER:
SCENE I
GOWER:
Enter PERICLES, on shipboard
PERICLES:
Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,
PERICLES:
Which wash both heaven and hell, and thou, that hast
PERICLES:
Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
PERICLES:
Having call'd them from the deep! O, still
PERICLES:
Thy deafening, dreadful thunders, gently quench
PERICLES:
Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,
PERICLES:
How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously,
PERICLES:
Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle
PERICLES:
Is as a whisper in the ears of death,
PERICLES:
Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O
PERICLES:
Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle
PERICLES:
To those that cry by night, convey thy deity
PERICLES:
Aboard our dancing boat, make swift the pangs
PERICLES:
Of my queen's travails!
PERICLES:
Enter LYCHORIDA, with an Infant
PERICLES:
Now, Lychorida!
LYCHORIDA:
Here is a thing too young for such a place,
LYCHORIDA:
Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I
LYCHORIDA:
Am like to do: take in your arms this piece
LYCHORIDA:
Of your dead queen.
PERICLES:
How, how, Lychorida!
LYCHORIDA:
Patience, good sir, do not assist the storm.
LYCHORIDA:
Here's all that is left living of your queen,
LYCHORIDA:
A little daughter: for the sake of it,
LYCHORIDA:
Be manly, and take comfort.
PERICLES:
O you gods!
PERICLES:
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,
PERICLES:
And snatch them straight away? We here below
PERICLES:
Recall not what we give, and therein may
PERICLES:
Use honour with you.
LYCHORIDA:
Patience, good sir,
LYCHORIDA:
Even for this charge.
PERICLES:
Now, mild may be thy life!
PERICLES:
For a more blustrous birth had never babe
PERICLES:
Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for
PERICLES:
Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
PERICLES:
That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!
PERICLES:
Thou hast as chiding a nativity
PERICLES:
As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,
PERICLES:
To herald thee from the womb: even at the first
PERICLES:
Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,
PERICLES:
With all thou canst find here. Now, the good gods
PERICLES:
Throw their best eyes upon't!
PERICLES:
Enter two Sailors
First Sailor:
What courage, sir? God save you!
PERICLES:
Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw,
PERICLES:
It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love
PERICLES:
Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,
PERICLES:
I would it would be quiet.
First Sailor:
Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?
First Sailor:
Blow, and split thyself.
Second Sailor:
But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss
Second Sailor:
the moon, I care not.
First Sailor:
Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,
First Sailor:
the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be
First Sailor:
cleared of the dead.
PERICLES:
That's your superstition.
First Sailor:
Pardon us, sir, with us at sea it hath been still
First Sailor:
observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore
First Sailor:
briefly yield her, for she must overboard straight.
PERICLES:
As you think meet. Most wretched queen!
LYCHORIDA:
Here she lies, sir.
PERICLES:
A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear,
PERICLES:
No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements
PERICLES:
Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time
PERICLES:
To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight
PERICLES:
Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze,
PERICLES:
Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
PERICLES:
And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale
PERICLES:
And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,
PERICLES:
Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,
PERICLES:
Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,
PERICLES:
My casket and my jewels, and bid Nicander
PERICLES:
Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe
PERICLES:
Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say
PERICLES:
A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.
PERICLES:
Exit LYCHORIDA
Second Sailor:
Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked
Second Sailor:
and bitumed ready.
PERICLES:
I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?
Second Sailor:
We are near Tarsus.
PERICLES:
Thither, gentle mariner.
PERICLES:
Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?
Second Sailor:
By break of day, if the wind cease.
PERICLES:
O, make for Tarsus!
PERICLES:
There will I visit Cleon, for the babe
PERICLES:
Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it
PERICLES:
At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner
PERICLES:
I'll bring the body presently.
PERICLES:
Exeunt
PERICLES:
SCENE II. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.
PERICLES:
Enter CERIMON, with a Servant, and some Persons who have been shipwrecked
CERIMON:
Philemon, ho!
CERIMON:
Enter PHILEMON
PHILEMON:
Doth my lord call?
CERIMON:
Get fire and meat for these poor men
CERIMON:
'T has been a turbulent and stormy night.
Servant:
I have been in many, but such a night as this,
Servant:
Till now, I ne'er endured.
CERIMON:
Your master will be dead ere you return,
CERIMON:
There's nothing can be minister'd to nature
CERIMON:
That can recover him.
CERIMON:
To PHILEMON
CERIMON:
Give this to the 'pothecary,
CERIMON:
And tell me how it works.
CERIMON:
Exeunt all but CERIMON
CERIMON:
Enter two Gentlemen
First Gentleman:
Good morrow.
Second Gentleman:
Good morrow to your lordship.
CERIMON:
Gentlemen,
CERIMON:
Why do you stir so early?
First Gentleman:
Sir,
First Gentleman:
Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
First Gentleman:
Shook as the earth did quake,
First Gentleman:
The very principals did seem to rend,
First Gentleman:
And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear
First Gentleman:
Made me to quit the house.
Second Gentleman:
That is the cause we trouble you so early,
Second Gentleman:
'Tis not our husbandry.
CERIMON:
O, you say well.
First Gentleman:
But I much marvel that your lordship, having
First Gentleman:
Rich tire about you, should at these early hours
First Gentleman:
Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
First Gentleman:
'Tis most strange,
First Gentleman:
Nature should be so conversant with pain,
First Gentleman:
Being thereto not compell'd.
CERIMON:
I hold it ever,
CERIMON:
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
CERIMON:
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
CERIMON:
May the two latter darken and expend,
CERIMON:
But immortality attends the former.
CERIMON:
Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever
CERIMON:
Have studied physic, through which secret art,
CERIMON:
By turning o'er authorities, I have,
CERIMON:
Together with my practise, made familiar
CERIMON:
To me and to my aid the blest infusions
CERIMON:
That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones,
CERIMON:
And I can speak of the disturbances
CERIMON:
That nature works, and of her cures, which doth give me
CERIMON:
A more content in course of true delight
CERIMON:
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
CERIMON:
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
CERIMON:
To please the fool and death.
Second Gentleman:
Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
Second Gentleman:
Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
Second Gentleman:
Your creatures, who by you have been restored
Second Gentleman:
And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
Second Gentleman:
Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
Second Gentleman:
Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.
Second Gentleman:
Enter two or three Servants with a chest
First Servant:
So, lift there.
CERIMON:
What is that?
First Servant:
Sir, even now
First Servant:
Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest
First Servant:
'Tis of some wreck.
CERIMON:
Set 't down, let's look upon't.
Second Gentleman:
'Tis like a coffin, sir.
CERIMON:
Whate'er it be,
CERIMON:
'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight
CERIMON:
If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
CERIMON:
'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.
Second Gentleman:
'Tis so, my lord.
CERIMON:
How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
CERIMON:
Did the sea cast it up?
First Servant:
I never saw so huge a billow, sir,
First Servant:
As toss'd it upon shore.
CERIMON:
Wrench it open,
CERIMON:
Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.
Second Gentleman:
A delicate odour.
CERIMON:
As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
CERIMON:
O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
First Gentleman:
Most strange!
CERIMON:
Shrouded in cloth of state, balm'd and entreasured
CERIMON:
With full bags of spices! A passport too!
CERIMON:
Apollo, perfect me in the characters!
CERIMON:
Reads from a scroll
CERIMON:
'Here I give to understand,
CERIMON:
If e'er this coffin drive a-land,
CERIMON:
I, King Pericles, have lost
CERIMON:
This queen, worth all our mundane cost.
CERIMON:
Who finds her, give her burying,
CERIMON:
She was the daughter of a king
CERIMON:
Besides this treasure for a fee,
CERIMON:
The gods requite his charity!'
CERIMON:
If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart
CERIMON:
That even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight.
Second Gentleman:
Most likely, sir.
CERIMON:
Nay, certainly to-night,
CERIMON:
For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
CERIMON:
That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within
CERIMON:
Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.
CERIMON:
Exit a Servant
CERIMON:
Death may usurp on nature many hours,
CERIMON:
And yet the fire of life kindle again
CERIMON:
The o'erpress'd spirits. I heard of an Egyptian
CERIMON:
That had nine hours lien dead,
CERIMON:
Who was by good appliance recovered.
CERIMON:
Re-enter a Servant, with boxes, napkins, and fire
CERIMON:
Well said, well said, the fire and cloths.
CERIMON:
The rough and woeful music that we have,
CERIMON:
Cause it to sound, beseech you.
CERIMON:
The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!
CERIMON:
The music there!--I pray you, give her air.
CERIMON:
Gentlemen.
CERIMON:
This queen will live: nature awakes, a warmth
CERIMON:
Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced
CERIMON:
Above five hours: see how she gins to blow
CERIMON:
Into life's flower again!
First Gentleman:
The heavens,
First Gentleman:
Through you, increase our wonder and set up
First Gentleman:
Your fame forever.
CERIMON:
She is alive, behold,
CERIMON:
Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels
CERIMON:
Which Pericles hath lost,
CERIMON:
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold,
CERIMON:
The diamonds of a most praised water
CERIMON:
Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
CERIMON:
And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
CERIMON:
Rare as you seem to be.
CERIMON:
She moves
THAISA:
O dear Diana,
THAISA:
Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?
Second Gentleman:
Is not this strange?
First Gentleman:
Most rare.
CERIMON:
Hush, my gentle neighbours!
CERIMON:
Lend me your hands, to the next chamber bear her.
CERIMON:
Get linen: now this matter must be look'd to,
CERIMON:
For her relapse is mortal. Come, come,
CERIMON:
And AEsculapius guide us!
CERIMON:
Exeunt, carrying her away
CERIMON:
SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.
CERIMON:
Enter PERICLES, CLEON, DIONYZA, and LYCHORIDA with MARINA in her arms
PERICLES:
Most honour'd Cleon, I must needs be gone,
PERICLES:
My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
PERICLES:
In a litigious peace. You, and your lady,
PERICLES:
Take from my heart all thankfulness! The gods
PERICLES:
Make up the rest upon you!
CLEON:
Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,
CLEON:
Yet glance full wanderingly on us.
DIONYZA:
O your sweet queen!
DIONYZA:
That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,
DIONYZA:
To have bless'd mine eyes with her!
PERICLES:
We cannot but obey
PERICLES:
The powers above us. Could I rage and roar
PERICLES:
As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end
PERICLES:
Must be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina, whom,
PERICLES:
For she was born at sea, I have named so, here
PERICLES:
I charge your charity withal, leaving her
PERICLES:
The infant of your care, beseeching you
PERICLES:
To give her princely training, that she may be
PERICLES:
Manner'd as she is born.
CLEON:
Fear not, my lord, but think
CLEON:
Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
CLEON:
For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
CLEON:
Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
CLEON:
Should therein make me vile, the common body,
CLEON:
By you relieved, would force me to my duty
CLEON:
But if to that my nature need a spur,
CLEON:
The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
CLEON:
To the end of generation!
PERICLES:
I believe you,
PERICLES:
Your honour and your goodness teach me to't,
PERICLES:
Without your vows. Till she be married, madam,
PERICLES:
By bright Diana, whom we honour, all
PERICLES:
Unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain,
PERICLES:
Though I show ill in't. So I take my leave.
PERICLES:
Good madam, make me blessed in your care
PERICLES:
In bringing up my child.
DIONYZA:
I have one myself,
DIONYZA:
Who shall not be more dear to my respect
DIONYZA:
Than yours, my lord.
PERICLES:
Madam, my thanks and prayers.
CLEON:
We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,
CLEON:
Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and
CLEON:
The gentlest winds of heaven.
PERICLES:
I will embrace
PERICLES:
Your offer. Come, dearest madam. O, no tears,
PERICLES:
Lychorida, no tears
PERICLES:
Look to your little mistress, on whose grace
PERICLES:
You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.
PERICLES:
Exeunt
PERICLES:
SCENE IV. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.
PERICLES:
Enter CERIMON and THAISA
CERIMON:
Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels,
CERIMON:
Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
CERIMON:
At your command. Know you the character?
THAISA:
It is my lord's.
THAISA:
That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,
THAISA:
Even on my eaning time, but whether there
THAISA:
Deliver'd, by the holy gods,
THAISA:
I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
THAISA:
My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
THAISA:
A vestal livery will I take me to,
THAISA:
And never more have joy.
CERIMON:
Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
CERIMON:
Diana's temple is not distant far,
CERIMON:
Where you may abide till your date expire.
CERIMON:
Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
CERIMON:
Shall there attend you.
THAISA:
My recompense is thanks, that's all,
THAISA:
Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
THAISA:
Exeunt
THAISA:
ACT IV
THAISA:
Enter GOWER
GOWER:
Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
GOWER:
Welcomed and settled to his own desire.
GOWER:
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
GOWER:
Unto Diana there a votaress.
GOWER:
Now to Marina bend your mind,
GOWER:
Whom our fast-growing scene must find
GOWER:
At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd
GOWER:
In music, letters, who hath gain'd
GOWER:
Of education all the grace,
GOWER:
Which makes her both the heart and place
GOWER:
Of general wonder. But, alack,
GOWER:
That monster envy, oft the wrack
GOWER:
Of earned praise, Marina's life
GOWER:
Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
GOWER:
And in this kind hath our Cleon
GOWER:
One daughter, and a wench full grown,
GOWER:
Even ripe for marriage-rite, this maid
GOWER:
Hight Philoten: and it is said
GOWER:
For certain in our story, she
GOWER:
Would ever with Marina be
GOWER:
Be't when she weaved the sleided silk
GOWER:
With fingers long, small, white as milk,
GOWER:
Or when she would with sharp needle wound
GOWER:
The cambric, which she made more sound
GOWER:
By hurting it, or when to the lute
GOWER:
She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
GOWER:
That still records with moan, or when
GOWER:
She would with rich and constant pen
GOWER:
Vail to her mistress Dian, still
GOWER:
This Philoten contends in skill
GOWER:
With absolute Marina: so
GOWER:
With the dove of Paphos might the crow
GOWER:
Vie feathers white. Marina gets
GOWER:
All praises, which are paid as debts,
GOWER:
And not as given. This so darks
GOWER:
In Philoten all graceful marks,
GOWER:
That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
GOWER:
A present murderer does prepare
GOWER:
For good Marina, that her daughter
GOWER:
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
GOWER:
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
GOWER:
Lychorida, our nurse, is dead
GOWER:
And cursed Dionyza hath
GOWER:
The pregnant instrument of wrath
GOWER:
Prest for this blow. The unborn event
GOWER:
I do commend to your content
GOWER:
Only I carry winged time
GOWER:
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme,
GOWER:
Which never could I so convey,
GOWER:
Unless your thoughts went on my way.
GOWER:
Dionyza does appear,
GOWER:
With Leonine, a murderer.
GOWER:
Exit
GOWER:
SCENE I. Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.
GOWER:
Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE
DIONYZA:
Thy oath remember, thou hast sworn to do't
DIONYZA:
'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
DIONYZA:
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
DIONYZA:
To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
DIONYZA:
Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
DIONYZA:
Inflame too nicely, nor let pity, which
DIONYZA:
Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
DIONYZA:
A soldier to thy purpose.
LEONINE:
I will do't, but yet she is a goodly creature.
DIONYZA:
The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here
DIONYZA:
she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
DIONYZA:
Thou art resolved?
LEONINE:
I am resolved.
LEONINE:
Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers
MARINA:
No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,
MARINA:
To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,
MARINA:
The purple violets, and marigolds,
MARINA:
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
MARINA:
While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
MARINA:
Born in a tempest, when my mother died,
MARINA:
This world to me is like a lasting storm,
MARINA:
Whirring me from my friends.
DIONYZA:
How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
DIONYZA:
How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
DIONYZA:
Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
DIONYZA:
A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed
DIONYZA:
With this unprofitable woe!
DIONYZA:
Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
DIONYZA:
Walk with Leonine, the air is quick there,
DIONYZA:
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
DIONYZA:
Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.
MARINA:
No, I pray you,
MARINA:
I'll not bereave you of your servant.
DIONYZA:
Come, come,
DIONYZA:
I love the king your father, and yourself,
DIONYZA:
With more than foreign heart. We every day
DIONYZA:
Expect him here: when he shall come and find
DIONYZA:
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
DIONYZA:
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage,
DIONYZA:
Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
DIONYZA:
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
DIONYZA:
Walk, and be cheerful once again, reserve
DIONYZA:
That excellent complexion, which did steal
DIONYZA:
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me
DIONYZA:
I can go home alone.
MARINA:
Well, I will go,
MARINA:
But yet I have no desire to it.
DIONYZA:
Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
DIONYZA:
Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least
DIONYZA:
Remember what I have said.
LEONINE:
I warrant you, madam.
DIONYZA:
I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while
DIONYZA:
Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood
DIONYZA:
What! I must have a care of you.
MARINA:
My thanks, sweet madam.
MARINA:
Exit DIONYZA
MARINA:
Is this wind westerly that blows?
LEONINE:
South-west.
MARINA:
When I was born, the wind was north.
LEONINE:
Was't so?
MARINA:
My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
MARINA:
But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling
MARINA:
His kingly hands, haling ropes,
MARINA:
And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
MARINA:
That almost burst the deck.
LEONINE:
When was this?
MARINA:
When I was born
MARINA:
Never was waves nor wind more violent,
MARINA:
And from the ladder-tackle washes off
MARINA:
A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'
MARINA:
And with a dropping industry they skip
MARINA:
From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
MARINA:
The master calls, and trebles their confusion.
LEONINE:
Come, say your prayers.
MARINA:
What mean you?
LEONINE:
If you require a little space for prayer,
LEONINE:
I grant it: pray, but be not tedious,
LEONINE:
For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
LEONINE:
To do my work with haste.
MARINA:
Why will you kill me?
LEONINE:
To satisfy my lady.
MARINA:
Why would she have me kill'd?
MARINA:
Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
MARINA:
I never did her hurt in all my life
MARINA:
I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
MARINA:
To any living creature: believe me, la,
MARINA:
I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly
MARINA:
I trod upon a worm against my will,
MARINA:
But I wept for it. How have I offended,
MARINA:
Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
MARINA:
Or my life imply her any danger?
LEONINE:
My commission
LEONINE:
Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.
MARINA:
You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
MARINA:
You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow
MARINA:
You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,
MARINA:
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought
MARINA:
Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now
MARINA:
Your lady seeks my life, come you between,
MARINA:
And save poor me, the weaker.
LEONINE:
I am sworn,
LEONINE:
And will dispatch.
LEONINE:
He seizes her
LEONINE:
Enter Pirates
First Pirate:
Hold, villain!
First Pirate:
LEONINE runs away
Second Pirate:
A prize! a prize!
Third Pirate:
Half-part, mates, half-part.
Third Pirate:
Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.
Third Pirate:
Exeunt Pirates with MARINA
Third Pirate:
Re-enter LEONINE
LEONINE:
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes,
LEONINE:
And they have seized Marina. Let her go
LEONINE:
There's no hope she will return. I'll swear
LEONINE:
she's dead,
LEONINE:
And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further
LEONINE:
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
LEONINE:
Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
LEONINE:
Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.
LEONINE:
Exit
LEONINE:
SCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.
LEONINE:
Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT
Pandar:
Boult!
BOULT:
Sir?
Pandar:
Search the market narrowly, Mytilene is full of
Pandar:
gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
Pandar:
too wenchless.
Bawd:
We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
Bawd:
poor three, and they can do no more than they can
Bawd:
do, and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.
Pandar:
Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for
Pandar:
them. If there be not a conscience to be used in
Pandar:
every trade, we shall never prosper.
Bawd:
Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor
Bawd:
bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--
BOULT:
Ay, to eleven, and brought them down again. But
BOULT:
shall I search the market?
Bawd:
What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind
Bawd:
will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.
Pandar:
Thou sayest true, they're too unwholesome, o'
Pandar:
conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that
Pandar:
lay with the little baggage.
BOULT:
Ay, she quickly pooped him, she made him roast-meat
BOULT:
for worms. But I'll go search the market.
BOULT:
Exit
Pandar:
Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a
Pandar:
proportion to live quietly, and so give over.
Bawd:
Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get
Bawd:
when we are old?
Pandar:
O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor
Pandar:
the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,
Pandar:
if in our youths we could pick up some pretty
Pandar:
estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.
Pandar:
Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods
Pandar:
will be strong with us for giving over.
Bawd:
Come, other sorts offend as well as we.
Pandar:
As well as we! ay, and better too, we offend worse.
Pandar:
Neither is our profession any trade, it's no
Pandar:
calling. But here comes Boult.
Pandar:
Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINA
BOULT:
[To MARINA]  Come your ways. My masters, you say
BOULT:
she's a virgin?
First Pirate:
O, sir, we doubt it not.
BOULT:
Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see
BOULT:
if you like her, so, if not, I have lost my earnest.
Bawd:
Boult, has she any qualities?
BOULT:
She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent
BOULT:
good clothes: there's no further necessity of
BOULT:
qualities can make her be refused.
Bawd:
What's her price, Boult?
BOULT:
I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
Pandar:
Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your
Pandar:
money presently. Wife, take her in, instruct her
Pandar:
what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her
Pandar:
entertainment.
Pandar:
Exeunt Pandar and Pirates
Bawd:
Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her
Bawd:
hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her
Bawd:
virginity, and cry 'He that will give most shall
Bawd:
have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap
Bawd:
thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done
Bawd:
as I command you.
BOULT:
Performance shall follow.
BOULT:
Exit
MARINA:
Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
MARINA:
He should have struck, not spoke, or that these pirates,
MARINA:
Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me
MARINA:
For to seek my mother!
Bawd:
Why lament you, pretty one?
MARINA:
That I am pretty.
Bawd:
Come, the gods have done their part in you.
MARINA:
I accuse them not.
Bawd:
You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.
MARINA:
The more my fault
MARINA:
To scape his hands where I was like to die.
Bawd:
Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.
MARINA:
No.
Bawd:
Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all
Bawd:
fashions: you shall fare well, you shall have the
Bawd:
difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?
MARINA:
Are you a woman?
Bawd:
What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?
MARINA:
An honest woman, or not a woman.
Bawd:
Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have
Bawd:
something to do with you. Come, you're a young
Bawd:
foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have
Bawd:
you.
MARINA:
The gods defend me!
Bawd:
If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men
Bawd:
must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir
Bawd:
you up. Boult's returned.
Bawd:
Re-enter BOULT
Bawd:
Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?
BOULT:
I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs,
BOULT:
I have drawn her picture with my voice.
Bawd:
And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the
Bawd:
inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?
BOULT:
'Faith, they listened to me as they would have
BOULT:
hearkened to their father's testament. There was a
BOULT:
Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to
BOULT:
her very description.
Bawd:
We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.
BOULT:
To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the
BOULT:
French knight that cowers i' the hams?
Bawd:
Who, Monsieur Veroles?
BOULT:
Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the
BOULT:
proclamation, but he made a groan at it, and swore
BOULT:
he would see her to-morrow.
Bawd:
Well, well, as for him, he brought his disease
Bawd:
hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will
Bawd:
come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the
Bawd:
sun.
BOULT:
Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we
BOULT:
should lodge them with this sign.
Bawd:
[To MARINA]  Pray you, come hither awhile. You
Bawd:
have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must
Bawd:
seem to do that fearfully which you commit
Bawd:
willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.
Bawd:
To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
Bawd:
lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good
Bawd:
opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.
MARINA:
I understand you not.
BOULT:
O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
BOULT:
blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.
Bawd:
Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must, for your
Bawd:
bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
Bawd:
with warrant.
BOULT:
'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if
BOULT:
I have bargained for the joint,--
Bawd:
Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.
BOULT:
I may so.
Bawd:
Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the
Bawd:
manner of your garments well.
BOULT:
Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
Bawd:
Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a
Bawd:
sojourner we have, you'll lose nothing by custom.
Bawd:
When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good
Bawd:
turn, therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou
Bawd:
hast the harvest out of thine own report.
BOULT:
I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake
BOULT:
the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up
BOULT:
the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.
Bawd:
Come your ways, follow me.
MARINA:
If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,
MARINA:
Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
MARINA:
Diana, aid my purpose!
Bawd:
What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?
Bawd:
Exeunt
Bawd:
SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.
Bawd:
Enter CLEON and DIONYZA
DIONYZA:
Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?
CLEON:
O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
CLEON:
The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!
DIONYZA:
I think
DIONYZA:
You'll turn a child again.
CLEON:
Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
CLEON:
I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,
CLEON:
Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
CLEON:
To equal any single crown o' the earth
CLEON:
I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!
CLEON:
Whom thou hast poison'd too
CLEON:
If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness
CLEON:
Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say
CLEON:
When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
DIONYZA:
That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
DIONYZA:
To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
DIONYZA:
She died at night, I'll say so. Who can cross it?
DIONYZA:
Unless you play the pious innocent,
DIONYZA:
And for an honest attribute cry out
DIONYZA:
'She died by foul play.'
CLEON:
O, go to. Well, well,
CLEON:
Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
CLEON:
Do like this worst.
DIONYZA:
Be one of those that think
DIONYZA:
The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
DIONYZA:
And open this to Pericles. I do shame
DIONYZA:
To think of what a noble strain you are,
DIONYZA:
And of how coward a spirit.
CLEON:
To such proceeding
CLEON:
Who ever but his approbation added,
CLEON:
Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
CLEON:
From honourable sources.
DIONYZA:
Be it so, then
DIONYZA:
Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
DIONYZA:
Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
DIONYZA:
She did disdain my child, and stood between
DIONYZA:
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
DIONYZA:
But cast their gazes on Marina's face,
DIONYZA:
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
DIONYZA:
Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through,
DIONYZA:
And though you call my course unnatural,
DIONYZA:
You not your child well loving, yet I find
DIONYZA:
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
DIONYZA:
Perform'd to your sole daughter.
CLEON:
Heavens forgive it!
DIONYZA:
And as for Pericles,
DIONYZA:
What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
DIONYZA:
And yet we mourn: her monument
DIONYZA:
Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
DIONYZA:
In glittering golden characters express
DIONYZA:
A general praise to her, and care in us
DIONYZA:
At whose expense 'tis done.
CLEON:
Thou art like the harpy,
CLEON:
Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,
CLEON:
Seize with thine eagle's talons.
DIONYZA:
You are like one that superstitiously
DIONYZA:
Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies
DIONYZA:
But yet I know you'll do as I advise.
DIONYZA:
Exeunt
DIONYZA:
SCENE IV
DIONYZA:
Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus
GOWER:
Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short,
GOWER:
Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't,
GOWER:
Making, to take your imagination,
GOWER:
From bourn to bourn, region to region.
GOWER:
By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
GOWER:
To use one language in each several clime
GOWER:
Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you
GOWER:
To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
GOWER:
The stages of our story. Pericles
GOWER:
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
GOWER:
Attended on by many a lord and knight.
GOWER:
To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
GOWER:
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
GOWER:
Advanced in time to great and high estate,
GOWER:
Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,
GOWER:
Old Helicanus goes along behind.
GOWER:
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
GOWER:
This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought,
GOWER:
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
GOWER:
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
GOWER:
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile,
GOWER:
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.
GOWER:
DUMB SHOW.
GOWER:
Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train,  CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows  PERICLES the tomb, whereat PERICLES makes  lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA
GOWER:
See how belief may suffer by foul show!
GOWER:
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe,
GOWER:
And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
GOWER:
With sighs shot through, and biggest tears
GOWER:
o'ershower'd,
GOWER:
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
GOWER:
Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs
GOWER:
He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
GOWER:
A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
GOWER:
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.
GOWER:
The epitaph is for Marina writ
GOWER:
By wicked Dionyza.
GOWER:
Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument
GOWER:
'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
GOWER:
Who wither'd in her spring of year.
GOWER:
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,
GOWER:
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter,
GOWER:
Marina was she call'd, and at her birth,
GOWER:
Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth
GOWER:
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
GOWER:
Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd
GOWER:
Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
GOWER:
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'
GOWER:
No visor does become black villany
GOWER:
So well as soft and tender flattery.
GOWER:
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
GOWER:
And bear his courses to be ordered
GOWER:
By Lady Fortune, while our scene must play
GOWER:
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
GOWER:
In her unholy service. Patience, then,
GOWER:
And think you now are all in Mytilene.
GOWER:
Exit
GOWER:
SCENE V. Mytilene. A street before the brothel.
GOWER:
Enter, from the brothel, two Gentlemen
First Gentleman:
Did you ever hear the like?
Second Gentleman:
No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she
Second Gentleman:
being once gone.
First Gentleman:
But to have divinity preached there! did you ever
First Gentleman:
dream of such a thing?
Second Gentleman:
No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses
Second Gentleman:
shall's go hear the vestals sing?
First Gentleman:
I'll do any thing now that is virtuous, but I
First Gentleman:
am out of the road of rutting for ever.
First Gentleman:
Exeunt
First Gentleman:
SCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel.
First Gentleman:
Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT
Pandar:
Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she
Pandar:
had ne'er come here.
Bawd:
Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god
Bawd:
Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must
Bawd:
either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she
Bawd:
should do for clients her fitment, and do me the
Bawd:
kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,
Bawd:
her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her
Bawd:
knees, that she would make a puritan of the devil,
Bawd:
if he should cheapen a kiss of her.
BOULT:
'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us
BOULT:
of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.
Pandar:
Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!
Bawd:
'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the
Bawd:
way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.
BOULT:
We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish
BOULT:
baggage would but give way to customers.
BOULT:
Enter LYSIMACHUS
LYSIMACHUS:
How now! How a dozen of virginities?
Bawd:
Now, the gods to-bless your honour!
BOULT:
I am glad to see your honour in good health.
LYSIMACHUS:
You may so, 'tis the better for you that your
LYSIMACHUS:
resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
LYSIMACHUS:
wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal
LYSIMACHUS:
withal, and defy the surgeon?
Bawd:
We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never
Bawd:
came her like in Mytilene.
LYSIMACHUS:
If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.
Bawd:
Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.
LYSIMACHUS:
Well, call forth, call forth.
BOULT:
For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall
BOULT:
see a rose, and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--
LYSIMACHUS:
What, prithee?
BOULT:
O, sir, I can be modest.
LYSIMACHUS:
That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it
LYSIMACHUS:
gives a good report to a number to be chaste.
LYSIMACHUS:
Exit BOULT
Bawd:
Here comes that which grows to the stalk, never
Bawd:
plucked yet, I can assure you.
Bawd:
Re-enter BOULT with MARINA
Bawd:
Is she not a fair creature?
LYSIMACHUS:
'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.
LYSIMACHUS:
Well, there's for you: leave us.
Bawd:
I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and
Bawd:
I'll have done presently.
LYSIMACHUS:
I beseech you, do.
Bawd:
[To MARINA]  First, I would have you note, this is
Bawd:
an honourable man.
MARINA:
I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.
Bawd:
Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man
Bawd:
whom I am bound to.
MARINA:
If he govern the country, you are bound to him
MARINA:
indeed, but how honourable he is in that, I know not.
Bawd:
Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will
Bawd:
you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.
MARINA:
What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.
LYSIMACHUS:
Ha' you done?
Bawd:
My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some
Bawd:
pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will
Bawd:
leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.
Bawd:
Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and BOULT
LYSIMACHUS:
Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?
MARINA:
What trade, sir?
LYSIMACHUS:
Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.
MARINA:
I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.
LYSIMACHUS:
How long have you been of this profession?
MARINA:
E'er since I can remember.
LYSIMACHUS:
Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at
LYSIMACHUS:
five or at seven?
MARINA:
Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
LYSIMACHUS:
Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a
LYSIMACHUS:
creature of sale.
MARINA:
Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,
MARINA:
and will come into 't? I hear say you are of
MARINA:
honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.
LYSIMACHUS:
Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?
MARINA:
Who is my principal?
LYSIMACHUS:
Why, your herb-woman, she that sets seeds and roots
LYSIMACHUS:
of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something
LYSIMACHUS:
of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious
LYSIMACHUS:
wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my
LYSIMACHUS:
authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly
LYSIMACHUS:
upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place
LYSIMACHUS:
come, come.
MARINA:
If you were born to honour, show it now,
MARINA:
If put upon you, make the judgment good
MARINA:
That thought you worthy of it.
LYSIMACHUS:
How's this? how's this? Some more, be sage.
MARINA:
For me,
MARINA:
That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune
MARINA:
Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,
MARINA:
Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,
MARINA:
O, that the gods
MARINA:
Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,
MARINA:
Though they did change me to the meanest bird
MARINA:
That flies i' the purer air!
LYSIMACHUS:
I did not think
LYSIMACHUS:
Thou couldst have spoke so well, ne'er dream'd thou couldst.
LYSIMACHUS:
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,
LYSIMACHUS:
Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee
LYSIMACHUS:
Persever in that clear way thou goest,
LYSIMACHUS:
And the gods strengthen thee!
MARINA:
The good gods preserve you!
LYSIMACHUS:
For me, be you thoughten
LYSIMACHUS:
That I came with no ill intent, for to me
LYSIMACHUS:
The very doors and windows savour vilely.
LYSIMACHUS:
Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and
LYSIMACHUS:
I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.
LYSIMACHUS:
Hold, here's more gold for thee.
LYSIMACHUS:
A curse upon him, die he like a thief,
LYSIMACHUS:
That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost
LYSIMACHUS:
Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.
LYSIMACHUS:
Re-enter BOULT
BOULT:
I beseech your honour, one piece for me.
LYSIMACHUS:
Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!
LYSIMACHUS:
Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,
LYSIMACHUS:
Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!
LYSIMACHUS:
Exit
BOULT:
How's this? We must take another course with you.
BOULT:
If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a
BOULT:
breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,
BOULT:
shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like
BOULT:
a spaniel. Come your ways.
MARINA:
Whither would you have me?
BOULT:
I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common
BOULT:
hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll
BOULT:
have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.
BOULT:
Re-enter Bawd
Bawd:
How now! what's the matter?
BOULT:
Worse and worse, mistress, she has here spoken holy
BOULT:
words to the Lord Lysimachus.
Bawd:
O abominable!
BOULT:
She makes our profession as it were to stink afore
BOULT:
the face of the gods.
Bawd:
Marry, hang her up for ever!
BOULT:
The nobleman would have dealt with her like a
BOULT:
nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a
BOULT:
snowball, saying his prayers too.
Bawd:
Boult, take her away, use her at thy pleasure
Bawd:
crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.
BOULT:
An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she
BOULT:
is, she shall be ploughed.
MARINA:
Hark, hark, you gods!
Bawd:
She conjures: away with her! Would she had never
Bawd:
come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born
Bawd:
to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?
Bawd:
Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!
Bawd:
Exit
BOULT:
Come, mistress, come your ways with me.
MARINA:
Whither wilt thou have me?
BOULT:
To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
MARINA:
Prithee, tell me one thing first.
BOULT:
Come now, your one thing.
MARINA:
What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?
BOULT:
Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.
MARINA:
Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
MARINA:
Since they do better thee in their command.
MARINA:
Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
MARINA:
Of hell would not in reputation change
MARINA:
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
MARINA:
Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib,
MARINA:
To the choleric fisting of every rogue
MARINA:
Thy ear is liable, thy food is such
MARINA:
As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
BOULT:
What would you have me do? go to the wars, would
BOULT:
you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss
BOULT:
of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to
BOULT:
buy him a wooden one?
MARINA:
Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty
MARINA:
OLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth,
MARINA:
Serve by indenture to the common hangman
MARINA:
Any of these ways are yet better than this,
MARINA:
For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,
MARINA:
Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods
MARINA:
Would safely deliver me from this place!
MARINA:
Here, here's gold for thee.
MARINA:
If that thy master would gain by thee,
MARINA:
Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
MARINA:
With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast
MARINA:
And I will undertake all these to teach.
MARINA:
I doubt not but this populous city will
MARINA:
Yield many scholars.
BOULT:
But can you teach all this you speak of?
MARINA:
Prove that I cannot, take me home again,
MARINA:
And prostitute me to the basest groom
MARINA:
That doth frequent your house.
BOULT:
Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can
BOULT:
place thee, I will.
MARINA:
But amongst honest women.
BOULT:
'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.
BOULT:
But since my master and mistress have bought you,
BOULT:
there's no going but by their consent: therefore I
BOULT:
will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I
BOULT:
doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.
BOULT:
Come, I'll do for thee what I can, come your ways.
BOULT:
Exeunt
BOULT:
ACT V
BOULT:
Enter GOWER
GOWER:
Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
GOWER:
Into an honest house, our story says.
GOWER:
She sings like one immortal, and she dances
GOWER:
As goddess-like to her admired lays,
GOWER:
Deep clerks she dumbs, and with her needle composes
GOWER:
Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
GOWER:
That even her art sisters the natural roses,
GOWER:
Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry
GOWER:
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
GOWER:
Who pour their bounty on her, and her gain
GOWER:
She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place,
GOWER:
And to her father turn our thoughts again,
GOWER:
Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost,
GOWER:
Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived
GOWER:
Here where his daughter dwells, and on this coast
GOWER:
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
GOWER:
God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
GOWER:
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
GOWER:
His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense,
GOWER:
And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
GOWER:
In your supposing once more put your sight
GOWER:
Of heavy Pericles, think this his bark
GOWER:
Where what is done in action, more, if might,
GOWER:
Shall be discover'd, please you, sit and hark.
GOWER:
Exit
GOWER:
SCENE I. On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A close
GOWER:
pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it, PERICLES
GOWER:
within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying
GOWER:
beside the Tyrian vessel.
GOWER:
Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to the barge, to them HELICANUS
Tyrian Sailor:
[To the Sailor of Mytilene]  Where is lord Helicanus?
Tyrian Sailor:
he can resolve you.
Tyrian Sailor:
O, here he is.
Tyrian Sailor:
Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,
Tyrian Sailor:
And in it is Lysimachus the governor,
Tyrian Sailor:
Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?
HELICANUS:
That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.
Tyrian Sailor:
Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.
Tyrian Sailor:
Enter two or three Gentlemen
First Gentleman:
Doth your lordship call?
HELICANUS:
Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard,
HELICANUS:
I pray ye, greet them fairly.
HELICANUS:
The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go on board the barge
HELICANUS:
Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords, with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors
Tyrian Sailor:
Sir,
Tyrian Sailor:
This is the man that can, in aught you would,
Tyrian Sailor:
Resolve you.
LYSIMACHUS:
Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!
HELICANUS:
And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
HELICANUS:
And die as I would do.
LYSIMACHUS:
You wish me well.
LYSIMACHUS:
Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,
LYSIMACHUS:
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,
LYSIMACHUS:
I made to it, to know of whence you are.
HELICANUS:
First, what is your place?
LYSIMACHUS:
I am the governor of this place you lie before.
HELICANUS:
Sir,
HELICANUS:
Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king,
HELICANUS:
A man who for this three months hath not spoken
HELICANUS:
To any one, nor taken sustenance
HELICANUS:
But to prorogue his grief.
LYSIMACHUS:
Upon what ground is his distemperature?
HELICANUS:
'Twould be too tedious to repeat,
HELICANUS:
But the main grief springs from the loss
HELICANUS:
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.
LYSIMACHUS:
May we not see him?
HELICANUS:
You may,
HELICANUS:
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.
LYSIMACHUS:
Yet let me obtain my wish.
HELICANUS:
Behold him.
HELICANUS:
PERICLES discovered
HELICANUS:
This was a goodly person,
HELICANUS:
Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
HELICANUS:
Drove him to this.
LYSIMACHUS:
Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!
LYSIMACHUS:
Hail, royal sir!
HELICANUS:
It is in vain, he will not speak to you.
First Lord:
Sir,
First Lord:
We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,
First Lord:
Would win some words of him.
LYSIMACHUS:
'Tis well bethought.
LYSIMACHUS:
She questionless with her sweet harmony
LYSIMACHUS:
And other chosen attractions, would allure,
LYSIMACHUS:
And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,
LYSIMACHUS:
Which now are midway stopp'd
LYSIMACHUS:
She is all happy as the fairest of all,
LYSIMACHUS:
And, with her fellow maids is now upon
LYSIMACHUS:
The leafy shelter that abuts against
LYSIMACHUS:
The island's side.
LYSIMACHUS:
Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of LYSIMACHUS
HELICANUS:
Sure, all's effectless, yet nothing we'll omit
HELICANUS:
That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness
HELICANUS:
We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you
HELICANUS:
That for our gold we may provision have,
HELICANUS:
Wherein we are not destitute for want,
HELICANUS:
But weary for the staleness.
LYSIMACHUS:
O, sir, a courtesy
LYSIMACHUS:
Which if we should deny, the most just gods
LYSIMACHUS:
For every graff would send a caterpillar,
LYSIMACHUS:
And so afflict our province. Yet once more
LYSIMACHUS:
Let me entreat to know at large the cause
LYSIMACHUS:
Of your king's sorrow.
HELICANUS:
Sit, sir, I will recount it to you
HELICANUS:
But, see, I am prevented.
HELICANUS:
Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a young Lady
LYSIMACHUS:
O, here is
LYSIMACHUS:
The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!
LYSIMACHUS:
Is't not a goodly presence?
HELICANUS:
She's a gallant lady.
LYSIMACHUS:
She's such a one, that, were I well assured
LYSIMACHUS:
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
LYSIMACHUS:
I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.
LYSIMACHUS:
Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty
LYSIMACHUS:
Expect even here, where is a kingly patient
LYSIMACHUS:
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
LYSIMACHUS:
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
LYSIMACHUS:
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
LYSIMACHUS:
As thy desires can wish.
MARINA:
Sir, I will use
MARINA:
My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided
MARINA:
That none but I and my companion maid
MARINA:
Be suffer'd to come near him.
LYSIMACHUS:
Come, let us leave her,
LYSIMACHUS:
And the gods make her prosperous!
LYSIMACHUS:
MARINA sings
LYSIMACHUS:
Mark'd he your music?
MARINA:
No, nor look'd on us.
LYSIMACHUS:
See, she will speak to him.
MARINA:
Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.
PERICLES:
Hum, ha!
MARINA:
I am a maid,
MARINA:
My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,
MARINA:
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,
MARINA:
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief
MARINA:
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
MARINA:
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
MARINA:
My derivation was from ancestors
MARINA:
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings
MARINA:
But time hath rooted out my parentage,
MARINA:
And to the world and awkward casualties
MARINA:
Bound me in servitude.
MARINA:
Aside
MARINA:
I will desist,
MARINA:
But there is something glows upon my cheek,
MARINA:
And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'
PERICLES:
My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--
PERICLES:
To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?
MARINA:
I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,
MARINA:
You would not do me violence.
PERICLES:
I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
PERICLES:
You are like something that--What country-woman?
PERICLES:
Here of these shores?
MARINA:
No, nor of any shores
MARINA:
Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
MARINA:
No other than I appear.
PERICLES:
I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
PERICLES:
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
PERICLES:
My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows,
PERICLES:
Her stature to an inch, as wand-like straight,
PERICLES:
As silver-voiced, her eyes as jewel-like
PERICLES:
And cased as richly, in pace another Juno,
PERICLES:
Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
PERICLES:
The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
MARINA:
Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
MARINA:
You may discern the place.
PERICLES:
Where were you bred?
PERICLES:
And how achieved you these endowments, which
PERICLES:
You make more rich to owe?
MARINA:
If I should tell my history, it would seem
MARINA:
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.
PERICLES:
Prithee, speak
PERICLES:
Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou look'st
PERICLES:
Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace
PERICLES:
For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will
PERICLES:
believe thee,
PERICLES:
And make my senses credit thy relation
PERICLES:
To points that seem impossible, for thou look'st
PERICLES:
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
PERICLES:
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
PERICLES:
Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
PERICLES:
From good descending?
MARINA:
So indeed I did.
PERICLES:
Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
PERICLES:
Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
PERICLES:
And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
PERICLES:
If both were open'd.
MARINA:
Some such thing
MARINA:
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
MARINA:
Did warrant me was likely.
PERICLES:
Tell thy story,
PERICLES:
If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
PERICLES:
Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
PERICLES:
Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
PERICLES:
Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
PERICLES:
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
PERICLES:
How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
PERICLES:
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.
MARINA:
My name is Marina.
PERICLES:
O, I am mock'd,
PERICLES:
And thou by some incensed god sent hither
PERICLES:
To make the world to laugh at me.
MARINA:
Patience, good sir,
MARINA:
Or here I'll cease.
PERICLES:
Nay, I'll be patient.
PERICLES:
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
PERICLES:
To call thyself Marina.
MARINA:
The name
MARINA:
Was given me by one that had some power,
MARINA:
My father, and a king.
PERICLES:
How! a king's daughter?
PERICLES:
And call'd Marina?
MARINA:
You said you would believe me,
MARINA:
But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
MARINA:
I will end here.
PERICLES:
But are you flesh and blood?
PERICLES:
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
PERICLES:
Motion! Well, speak on. Where were you born?
PERICLES:
And wherefore call'd Marina?
MARINA:
Call'd Marina
MARINA:
For I was born at sea.
PERICLES:
At sea! what mother?
MARINA:
My mother was the daughter of a king,
MARINA:
Who died the minute I was born,
MARINA:
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
MARINA:
Deliver'd weeping.
PERICLES:
O, stop there a little!
PERICLES:
Aside
PERICLES:
This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
PERICLES:
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be
PERICLES:
My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
PERICLES:
I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
PERICLES:
And never interrupt you.
MARINA:
You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.
PERICLES:
I will believe you by the syllable
PERICLES:
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave
PERICLES:
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?
MARINA:
The king my father did in Tarsus leave me,
MARINA:
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
MARINA:
Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd
MARINA:
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,
MARINA:
A crew of pirates came and rescued me,
MARINA:
Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
MARINA:
Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?
MARINA:
It may be,
MARINA:
You think me an impostor: no, good faith,
MARINA:
I am the daughter to King Pericles,
MARINA:
If good King Pericles be.
PERICLES:
Ho, Helicanus!
HELICANUS:
Calls my lord?
PERICLES:
Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
PERICLES:
Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,
PERICLES:
What this maid is, or what is like to be,
PERICLES:
That thus hath made me weep?
HELICANUS:
I know not, but
HELICANUS:
Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene
HELICANUS:
Speaks nobly of her.
LYSIMACHUS:
She would never tell
LYSIMACHUS:
Her parentage, being demanded that,
LYSIMACHUS:
She would sit still and weep.
PERICLES:
O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir,
PERICLES:
Give me a gash, put me to present pain,
PERICLES:
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
PERICLES:
O'erbear the shores of my mortality,
PERICLES:
And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,
PERICLES:
Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget,
PERICLES:
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
PERICLES:
And found at sea again! O Helicanus,
PERICLES:
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
PERICLES:
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.
PERICLES:
What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,
PERICLES:
For truth can never be confirm'd enough,
PERICLES:
Though doubts did ever sleep.
MARINA:
First, sir, I pray,
MARINA:
What is your title?
PERICLES:
I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
PERICLES:
My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
PERICLES:
Thou hast been godlike perfect,
PERICLES:
The heir of kingdoms and another like
PERICLES:
To Pericles thy father.
MARINA:
Is it no more to be your daughter than
MARINA:
To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
MARINA:
Thaisa was my mother, who did end
MARINA:
The minute I began.
PERICLES:
Now, blessing on thee! rise, thou art my child.
PERICLES:
Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus,
PERICLES:
She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,
PERICLES:
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all,
PERICLES:
When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
PERICLES:
She is thy very princess. Who is this?
HELICANUS:
Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,
HELICANUS:
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
HELICANUS:
Did come to see you.
PERICLES:
I embrace you.
PERICLES:
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
PERICLES:
O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?
PERICLES:
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
PERICLES:
O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
PERICLES:
How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?
HELICANUS:
My lord, I hear none.
PERICLES:
None!
PERICLES:
The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.
LYSIMACHUS:
It is not good to cross him, give him way.
PERICLES:
Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?
LYSIMACHUS:
My lord, I hear.
LYSIMACHUS:
Music
PERICLES:
Most heavenly music!
PERICLES:
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber
PERICLES:
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.
PERICLES:
Sleeps
LYSIMACHUS:
A pillow for his head
LYSIMACHUS:
So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
LYSIMACHUS:
If this but answer to my just belief,
LYSIMACHUS:
I'll well remember you.
LYSIMACHUS:
Exeunt all but PERICLES
LYSIMACHUS:
DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision
DIANA:
My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,
DIANA:
And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
DIANA:
There, when my maiden priests are met together,
DIANA:
Before the people all,
DIANA:
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife
DIANA:
To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call
DIANA:
And give them repetition to the life.
DIANA:
Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe,
DIANA:
Do it, and happy, by my silver bow!
DIANA:
Awake, and tell thy dream.
DIANA:
Disappears
PERICLES:
Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,
PERICLES:
I will obey thee. Helicanus!
PERICLES:
Re-enter HELICANUS, LYSIMACHUS, and MARINA
HELICANUS:
Sir?
PERICLES:
My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
PERICLES:
The inhospitable Cleon, but I am
PERICLES:
For other service first: toward Ephesus
PERICLES:
Turn our blown sails, eftsoons I'll tell thee why.
PERICLES:
To LYSIMACHUS
PERICLES:
Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
PERICLES:
And give you gold for such provision
PERICLES:
As our intents will need?
LYSIMACHUS:
Sir,
LYSIMACHUS:
With all my heart, and, when you come ashore,
LYSIMACHUS:
I have another suit.
PERICLES:
You shall prevail,
PERICLES:
Were it to woo my daughter, for it seems
PERICLES:
You have been noble towards her.
LYSIMACHUS:
Sir, lend me your arm.
PERICLES:
Come, my Marina.
PERICLES:
Exeunt
PERICLES:
SCENE II
PERICLES:
Enter GOWER, before the temple of DIANA at Ephesus
GOWER:
Now our sands are almost run,
GOWER:
More a little, and then dumb.
GOWER:
This, my last boon, give me,
GOWER:
For such kindness must relieve me,
GOWER:
That you aptly will suppose
GOWER:
What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
GOWER:
What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
GOWER:
The regent made in Mytilene
GOWER:
To greet the king. So he thrived,
GOWER:
That he is promised to be wived
GOWER:
To fair Marina, but in no wise
GOWER:
Till he had done his sacrifice,
GOWER:
As Dian bade: whereto being bound,
GOWER:
The interim, pray you, all confound.
GOWER:
In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,
GOWER:
And wishes fall out as they're will'd.
GOWER:
At Ephesus, the temple see,
GOWER:
Our king and all his company.
GOWER:
That he can hither come so soon,
GOWER:
Is by your fancy's thankful doom.
GOWER:
Exit
GOWER:
SCENE III. The temple of Diana at Ephesus, THAISA standing
GOWER:
near the altar, as high priestess, a number of
GOWER:
Virgins on each side, CERIMON and other Inhabitants
GOWER:
of Ephesus attending.
GOWER:
Enter PERICLES, with his train, LYSIMACHUS, HELICANUS, MARINA, and a Lady
PERICLES:
Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
PERICLES:
I here confess myself the king of Tyre,
PERICLES:
Who, frighted from my country, did wed
PERICLES:
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
PERICLES:
At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
PERICLES:
A maid-child call'd Marina, who, O goddess,
PERICLES:
Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
PERICLES:
Was nursed with Cleon, who at fourteen years
PERICLES:
He sought to murder: but her better stars
PERICLES:
Brought her to Mytilene, 'gainst whose shore
PERICLES:
Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
PERICLES:
Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
PERICLES:
Made known herself my daughter.
THAISA:
Voice and favour!
THAISA:
You are, you are--O royal Pericles!
THAISA:
Faints
PERICLES:
What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!
CERIMON:
Noble sir,
CERIMON:
If you have told Diana's altar true,
CERIMON:
This is your wife.
PERICLES:
Reverend appearer, no,
PERICLES:
I threw her overboard with these very arms.
CERIMON:
Upon this coast, I warrant you.
PERICLES:
'Tis most certain.
CERIMON:
Look to the lady, O, she's but o'erjoy'd.
CERIMON:
Early in blustering morn this lady was
CERIMON:
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,
CERIMON:
Found there rich jewels, recover'd her, and placed her
CERIMON:
Here in Diana's temple.
PERICLES:
May we see them?
CERIMON:
Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
CERIMON:
Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.
THAISA:
O, let me look!
THAISA:
If he be none of mine, my sanctity
THAISA:
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,
THAISA:
But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,
THAISA:
Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,
THAISA:
Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,
THAISA:
A birth, and death?
PERICLES:
The voice of dead Thaisa!
THAISA:
That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
THAISA:
And drown'd.
PERICLES:
Immortal Dian!
THAISA:
Now I know you better.
THAISA:
When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
THAISA:
The king my father gave you such a ring.
THAISA:
Shows a ring
PERICLES:
This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness
PERICLES:
Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,
PERICLES:
That on the touching of her lips I may
PERICLES:
Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried
PERICLES:
A second time within these arms.
MARINA:
My heart
MARINA:
Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.
MARINA:
Kneels to THAISA
PERICLES:
Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa,
PERICLES:
Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina
PERICLES:
For she was yielded there.
THAISA:
Blest, and mine own!
HELICANUS:
Hail, madam, and my queen!
THAISA:
I know you not.
PERICLES:
You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
PERICLES:
I left behind an ancient substitute
PERICLES:
Can you remember what I call'd the man?
PERICLES:
I have named him oft.
THAISA:
'Twas Helicanus then.
PERICLES:
Still confirmation
PERICLES:
Embrace him, dear Thaisa, this is he.
PERICLES:
Now do I long to hear how you were found,
PERICLES:
How possibly preserved, and who to thank,
PERICLES:
Besides the gods, for this great miracle.
THAISA:
Lord Cerimon, my lord, this man,
THAISA:
Through whom the gods have shown their power, that can
THAISA:
From first to last resolve you.
PERICLES:
Reverend sir,
PERICLES:
The gods can have no mortal officer
PERICLES:
More like a god than you. Will you deliver
PERICLES:
How this dead queen re-lives?
CERIMON:
I will, my lord.
CERIMON:
Beseech you, first go with me to my house,
CERIMON:
Where shall be shown you all was found with her,
CERIMON:
How she came placed here in the temple,
CERIMON:
No needful thing omitted.
PERICLES:
Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I
PERICLES:
Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,
PERICLES:
This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
PERICLES:
Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,
PERICLES:
This ornament
PERICLES:
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form,
PERICLES:
And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,
PERICLES:
To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.
THAISA:
Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
THAISA:
My father's dead.
PERICLES:
Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
PERICLES:
We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
PERICLES:
Will in that kingdom spend our following days
PERICLES:
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
PERICLES:
Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
PERICLES:
To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.
PERICLES:
Exeunt
PERICLES:
Enter GOWER
GOWER:
In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
GOWER:
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward
GOWER:
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
GOWER:
Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
GOWER:
Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
GOWER:
Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last
GOWER:
In Helicanus may you well descry
GOWER:
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty
GOWER:
In reverend Cerimon there well appears
GOWER:
The worth that learned charity aye wears
GOWER:
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
GOWER:
Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
GOWER:
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
GOWER:
That him and his they in his palace burn,
GOWER:
The gods for murder seemed so content
GOWER:
To punish them, although not done, but meant.
GOWER:
So, on your patience evermore attending,
GOWER:
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.
GOWER:
Exit
