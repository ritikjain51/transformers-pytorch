MALCOLM:
ACT I
MALCOLM:
SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.
MALCOLM:
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.
ESCALUS:
My lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government the properties to unfold,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Since I am put to know that your own science
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
DUKE VINCENTIO:
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And let them work. The nature of our people,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Our city's institutions, and the terms
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As art and practise hath enriched any
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we remember. There is our commission,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I say, bid come before us Angelo.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exit an Attendant
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What figure of us think you he will bear?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For you must know, we have with special soul
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Elected him our absence to supply,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And given his deputation all the organs
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of our own power: what think you of it?
ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worth
ESCALUS:
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
ESCALUS:
It is Lord Angelo.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look where he comes.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter ANGELO
ANGELO:
Always obedient to your grace's will,
ANGELO:
I come to know your pleasure.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Angelo,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
There is a kind of character in thy life,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That to the observer doth thy history
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not light them for themselves, for if our virtues
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The smallest scruple of her excellence
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Herself the glory of a creditor,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To one that can my part in him advertise,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
DUKE VINCENTIO:
In our remove be thou at full ourself,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take thy commission.
ANGELO:
Now, good my lord,
ANGELO:
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
ANGELO:
Before so noble and so great a figure
ANGELO:
Be stamp'd upon it.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more evasion
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Proceeded to you, therefore take your honours.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As time and our concernings shall importune,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
How it goes with us, and do look to know
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of your commissions.
ANGELO:
Yet give leave, my lord,
ANGELO:
That we may bring you something on the way.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
My haste may not admit it,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
DUKE VINCENTIO:
With any scruple, your scope is as mine own
DUKE VINCENTIO:
So to enforce or qualify the laws
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll privily away. I love the people,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But do not like to stage me to their eyes
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Through it do well, I do not relish well
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Their loud applause and Aves vehement,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
ANGELO:
The heavens give safety to your purposes!
ESCALUS:
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
DUKE:
I thank you. Fare you well.
DUKE:
Exit
ESCALUS:
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
ESCALUS:
To have free speech with you, and it concerns me
ESCALUS:
To look into the bottom of my place
ESCALUS:
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
ESCALUS:
I am not yet instructed.
ANGELO:
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
ANGELO:
And we may soon our satisfaction have
ANGELO:
Touching that point.
ESCALUS:
I'll wait upon your honour.
ESCALUS:
Exeunt
ESCALUS:
SCENE II. A Street.
ESCALUS:
Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
LUCIO:
If the duke with the other dukes come not to
LUCIO:
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
LUCIO:
the dukes fall upon the king.
First Gentleman:
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
First Gentleman:
Hungary's!
Second Gentleman:
Amen.
LUCIO:
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
LUCIO:
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
LUCIO:
one out of the table.
Second Gentleman:
'Thou shalt not steal'?
LUCIO:
Ay, that he razed.
First Gentleman:
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
First Gentleman:
all the rest from their functions: they put forth
First Gentleman:
to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
First Gentleman:
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
First Gentleman:
well that prays for peace.
Second Gentleman:
I never heard any soldier dislike it.
LUCIO:
I believe thee, for I think thou never wast where
LUCIO:
grace was said.
Second Gentleman:
No? a dozen times at least.
First Gentleman:
What, in metre?
LUCIO:
In any proportion or in any language.
First Gentleman:
I think, or in any religion.
LUCIO:
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
LUCIO:
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
LUCIO:
wicked villain, despite of all grace.
First Gentleman:
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
LUCIO:
I grant, as there may between the lists and the
LUCIO:
velvet. Thou art the list.
First Gentleman:
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet, thou'rt
First Gentleman:
a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
First Gentleman:
be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
First Gentleman:
art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
First Gentleman:
feelingly now?
LUCIO:
I think thou dost, and, indeed, with most painful
LUCIO:
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
LUCIO:
confession, learn to begin thy health, but, whilst I
LUCIO:
live, forget to drink after thee.
First Gentleman:
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
Second Gentleman:
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.
LUCIO:
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
LUCIO:
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--
Second Gentleman:
To what, I pray?
LUCIO:
Judge.
Second Gentleman:
To three thousand dolours a year.
First Gentleman:
Ay, and more.
LUCIO:
A French crown more.
First Gentleman:
Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou
First Gentleman:
art full of error, I am sound.
LUCIO:
Nay, not as one would say, healthy, but so sound as
LUCIO:
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow,
LUCIO:
impiety has made a feast of thee.
LUCIO:
Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE
First Gentleman:
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, well, there's one yonder arrested and carried
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
Second Gentleman:
Who's that, I pray thee?
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
First Gentleman:
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
him carried away, and, which is more, within these
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
three days his head to be chopped off.
LUCIO:
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
LUCIO:
Art thou sure of this?
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Julietta with child.
LUCIO:
Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
LUCIO:
hours since, and he was ever precise in
LUCIO:
promise-keeping.
Second Gentleman:
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
Second Gentleman:
speech we had to such a purpose.
First Gentleman:
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
LUCIO:
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
LUCIO:
Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
custom-shrunk.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Enter POMPEY
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
How now! what's the news with you?
POMPEY:
Yonder man is carried to prison.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, what has he done?
POMPEY:
A woman.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But what's his offence?
POMPEY:
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What, is there a maid with child by him?
POMPEY:
No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
POMPEY:
not heard of the proclamation, have you?
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What proclamation, man?
POMPEY:
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
And what shall become of those in the city?
POMPEY:
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
POMPEY:
but that a wise burgher put in for them.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
pulled down?
POMPEY:
To the ground, mistress.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What shall become of me?
POMPEY:
Come, fear you not: good counsellors lack no
POMPEY:
clients: though you change your place, you need not
POMPEY:
change your trade, I'll be your tapster still.
POMPEY:
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
POMPEY:
have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
POMPEY:
will be considered.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.
POMPEY:
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
POMPEY:
prison, and there's Madam Juliet.
POMPEY:
Exeunt
POMPEY:
Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers
CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
CLAUDIO:
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
Provost:
I do it not in evil disposition,
Provost:
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
CLAUDIO:
Thus can the demigod Authority
CLAUDIO:
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
CLAUDIO:
The words of heaven, on whom it will, it will,
CLAUDIO:
On whom it will not, so, yet still 'tis just.
CLAUDIO:
Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
LUCIO:
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
CLAUDIO:
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty
CLAUDIO:
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
CLAUDIO:
So every scope by the immoderate use
CLAUDIO:
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
CLAUDIO:
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
CLAUDIO:
A thirsty evil, and when we drink we die.
LUCIO:
If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
LUCIO:
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
LUCIO:
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
LUCIO:
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
LUCIO:
offence, Claudio?
CLAUDIO:
What but to speak of would offend again.
LUCIO:
What, is't murder?
CLAUDIO:
No.
LUCIO:
Lechery?
CLAUDIO:
Call it so.
Provost:
Away, sir! you must go.
CLAUDIO:
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
LUCIO:
A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
LUCIO:
Is lechery so look'd after?
CLAUDIO:
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
CLAUDIO:
I got possession of Julietta's bed
CLAUDIO:
You know the lady, she is fast my wife,
CLAUDIO:
Save that we do the denunciation lack
CLAUDIO:
Of outward order: this we came not to,
CLAUDIO:
Only for propagation of a dower
CLAUDIO:
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
CLAUDIO:
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
CLAUDIO:
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
CLAUDIO:
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
CLAUDIO:
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?
CLAUDIO:
Unhappily, even so.
CLAUDIO:
And the new deputy now for the duke--
CLAUDIO:
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
CLAUDIO:
Or whether that the body public be
CLAUDIO:
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
CLAUDIO:
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
CLAUDIO:
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur,
CLAUDIO:
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
CLAUDIO:
Or in his emmence that fills it up,
CLAUDIO:
I stagger in:--but this new governor
CLAUDIO:
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
CLAUDIO:
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
CLAUDIO:
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
CLAUDIO:
And none of them been worn, and, for a name,
CLAUDIO:
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
CLAUDIO:
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
LUCIO:
I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
LUCIO:
thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
LUCIO:
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
LUCIO:
him.
CLAUDIO:
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
CLAUDIO:
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service
CLAUDIO:
This day my sister should the cloister enter
CLAUDIO:
And there receive her approbation
CLAUDIO:
Acquaint her with the danger of my state
CLAUDIO:
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
CLAUDIO:
To the strict deputy, bid herself assay him
CLAUDIO:
I have great hope in that, for in her youth
CLAUDIO:
There is a prone and speechless dialect,
CLAUDIO:
Such as move men, beside, she hath prosperous art
CLAUDIO:
When she will play with reason and discourse,
CLAUDIO:
And well she can persuade.
LUCIO:
I pray she may, as well for the encouragement of the
LUCIO:
like, which else would stand under grievous
LUCIO:
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
LUCIO:
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
LUCIO:
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
CLAUDIO:
I thank you, good friend Lucio.
LUCIO:
Within two hours.
CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away!
CLAUDIO:
Exeunt
CLAUDIO:
SCENE III. A monastery.
CLAUDIO:
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS
DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father, throw away that thought,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
DUKE VINCENTIO:
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of burning youth.
FRIAR THOMAS:
May your grace speak of it?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, none better knows than you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
How I have ever loved the life removed
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will demand of me why I do this?
FRIAR THOMAS:
Gladly, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Only to stick it in their children's sight
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd, so our decrees,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And liberty plucks justice by the nose,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Goes all decorum.
FRIAR THOMAS:
It rested in your grace
FRIAR THOMAS:
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased
FRIAR THOMAS:
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
FRIAR THOMAS:
Than in Lord Angelo.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do fear, too dreadful
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I have on Angelo imposed the office,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And yet my nature never in the fight
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
DUKE VINCENTIO:
How I may formally in person bear me
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
DUKE VINCENTIO:
At our more leisure shall I render you,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Stands at a guard with envy, scarce confesses
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exeunt
DUKE VINCENTIO:
SCENE IV. A nunnery.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA
ISABELLA:
And have you nuns no farther privileges?
FRANCISCA:
Are not these large enough?
ISABELLA:
Yes, truly, I speak not as desiring more,
ISABELLA:
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
ISABELLA:
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.
LUCIO:
[Within]  Ho! Peace be in this place!
ISABELLA:
Who's that which calls?
FRANCISCA:
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
FRANCISCA:
Turn you the key, and know his business of him,
FRANCISCA:
You may, I may not, you are yet unsworn.
FRANCISCA:
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
FRANCISCA:
But in the presence of the prioress
FRANCISCA:
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
FRANCISCA:
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
FRANCISCA:
He calls again, I pray you, answer him.
FRANCISCA:
Exit
ISABELLA:
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
ISABELLA:
Enter LUCIO
LUCIO:
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
LUCIO:
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
LUCIO:
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
LUCIO:
A novice of this place and the fair sister
LUCIO:
To her unhappy brother Claudio?
ISABELLA:
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
ISABELLA:
The rather for I now must make you know
ISABELLA:
I am that Isabella and his sister.
LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you
LUCIO:
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
ISABELLA:
Woe me! for what?
LUCIO:
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
LUCIO:
He should receive his punishment in thanks
LUCIO:
He hath got his friend with child.
ISABELLA:
Sir, make me not your story.
LUCIO:
It is true.
LUCIO:
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
LUCIO:
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
LUCIO:
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so
LUCIO:
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
LUCIO:
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
LUCIO:
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
LUCIO:
As with a saint.
ISABELLA:
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
LUCIO:
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus
LUCIO:
Your brother and his lover have embraced
LUCIO:
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
LUCIO:
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
LUCIO:
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
LUCIO:
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
ISABELLA:
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
LUCIO:
Is she your cousin?
ISABELLA:
Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names
ISABELLA:
By vain though apt affection.
LUCIO:
She it is.
ISABELLA:
O, let him marry her.
LUCIO:
This is the point.
LUCIO:
The duke is very strangely gone from hence,
LUCIO:
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
LUCIO:
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
LUCIO:
By those that know the very nerves of state,
LUCIO:
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
LUCIO:
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
LUCIO:
And with full line of his authority,
LUCIO:
Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood
LUCIO:
Is very snow-broth, one who never feels
LUCIO:
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
LUCIO:
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
LUCIO:
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
LUCIO:
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
LUCIO:
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
LUCIO:
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
LUCIO:
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
LUCIO:
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it,
LUCIO:
And follows close the rigour of the statute,
LUCIO:
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
LUCIO:
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
LUCIO:
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
LUCIO:
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
ISABELLA:
Doth he so seek his life?
LUCIO:
Has censured him
LUCIO:
Already, and, as I hear, the provost hath
LUCIO:
A warrant for his execution.
ISABELLA:
Alas! what poor ability's in me
ISABELLA:
To do him good?
LUCIO:
Assay the power you have.
ISABELLA:
My power? Alas, I doubt--
LUCIO:
Our doubts are traitors
LUCIO:
And make us lose the good we oft might win
LUCIO:
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
LUCIO:
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
LUCIO:
Men give like gods, but when they weep and kneel,
LUCIO:
All their petitions are as freely theirs
LUCIO:
As they themselves would owe them.
ISABELLA:
I'll see what I can do.
LUCIO:
But speedily.
ISABELLA:
I will about it straight,
ISABELLA:
No longer staying but to give the mother
ISABELLA:
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you
ISABELLA:
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
ISABELLA:
I'll send him certain word of my success.
LUCIO:
I take my leave of you.
ISABELLA:
Good sir, adieu.
ISABELLA:
Exeunt
ISABELLA:
ACT II
ISABELLA:
SCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house.
ISABELLA:
Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behind
ANGELO:
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
ANGELO:
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
ANGELO:
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
ANGELO:
Their perch and not their terror.
ESCALUS:
Ay, but yet
ESCALUS:
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
ESCALUS:
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
ESCALUS:
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
ESCALUS:
Let but your honour know,
ESCALUS:
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
ESCALUS:
That, in the working of your own affections,
ESCALUS:
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
ESCALUS:
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
ESCALUS:
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
ESCALUS:
Whether you had not sometime in your life
ESCALUS:
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
ESCALUS:
And pull'd the law upon you.
ANGELO:
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
ANGELO:
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
ANGELO:
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
ANGELO:
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
ANGELO:
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
ANGELO:
That justice seizes: what know the laws
ANGELO:
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
ANGELO:
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
ANGELO:
Because we see it, but what we do not see
ANGELO:
We tread upon, and never think of it.
ANGELO:
You may not so extenuate his offence
ANGELO:
For I have had such faults, but rather tell me,
ANGELO:
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
ANGELO:
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
ANGELO:
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
ESCALUS:
Be it as your wisdom will.
ANGELO:
Where is the provost?
Provost:
Here, if it like your honour.
ANGELO:
See that Claudio
ANGELO:
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning
ANGELO:
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared,
ANGELO:
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
ANGELO:
Exit Provost
ESCALUS:
[Aside]  Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
ESCALUS:
Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall
ESCALUS:
Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none
ESCALUS:
And some condemned for a fault alone.
ESCALUS:
Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY
ELBOW:
Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
ELBOW:
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
ELBOW:
common houses, I know no law: bring them away.
ANGELO:
How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?
ELBOW:
If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
ELBOW:
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
ELBOW:
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
ELBOW:
honour two notorious benefactors.
ANGELO:
Benefactors? Well, what benefactors are they? are
ANGELO:
they not malefactors?
ELBOW:
If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
ELBOW:
are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
ELBOW:
of, and void of all profanation in the world that
ELBOW:
good Christians ought to have.
ESCALUS:
This comes off well, here's a wise officer.
ANGELO:
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
ANGELO:
name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?
POMPEY:
He cannot, sir, he's out at elbow.
ANGELO:
What are you, sir?
ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, sir, parcel-bawd, one that
ELBOW:
serves a bad woman, whose house, sir, was, as they
ELBOW:
say, plucked down in the suburbs, and now she
ELBOW:
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.
ESCALUS:
How know you that?
ELBOW:
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--
ESCALUS:
How? thy wife?
ELBOW:
Ay, sir, whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--
ESCALUS:
Dost thou detest her therefore?
ELBOW:
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
ELBOW:
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
ELBOW:
it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.
ESCALUS:
How dost thou know that, constable?
ELBOW:
Marry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a woman
ELBOW:
cardinally given, might have been accused in
ELBOW:
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
ESCALUS:
By the woman's means?
ELBOW:
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
ELBOW:
spit in his face, so she defied him.
POMPEY:
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
ELBOW:
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
ELBOW:
man, prove it.
ESCALUS:
Do you hear how he misplaces?
POMPEY:
Sir, she came in great with child, and longing,
POMPEY:
saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes,
POMPEY:
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
POMPEY:
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
POMPEY:
dish of some three-pence, your honours have seen
POMPEY:
such dishes, they are not China dishes, but very
POMPEY:
good dishes,--
ESCALUS:
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
POMPEY:
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin, you are therein in
POMPEY:
the right: but to the point. As I say, this
POMPEY:
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
POMPEY:
being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
POMPEY:
prunes, and having but two in the dish, as I said,
POMPEY:
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
POMPEY:
rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
POMPEY:
honestly, for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
POMPEY:
not give you three-pence again.
FROTH:
No, indeed.
POMPEY:
Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
POMPEY:
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--
FROTH:
Ay, so I did indeed.
POMPEY:
Why, very well, I telling you then, if you be
POMPEY:
remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
POMPEY:
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
POMPEY:
good diet, as I told you,--
FROTH:
All this is true.
POMPEY:
Why, very well, then,--
ESCALUS:
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
ESCALUS:
was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
ESCALUS:
complain of? Come me to what was done to her.
POMPEY:
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
ESCALUS:
No, sir, nor I mean it not.
POMPEY:
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
POMPEY:
leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
POMPEY:
here, sir, a man of four-score pound a year, whose
POMPEY:
father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
POMPEY:
Master Froth?
FROTH:
All-hallond eve.
POMPEY:
Why, very well, I hope here be truths. He, sir,
POMPEY:
sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir, 'twas in
POMPEY:
the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
POMPEY:
to sit, have you not?
FROTH:
I have so, because it is an open room and good for winter.
POMPEY:
Why, very well, then, I hope here be truths.
ANGELO:
This will last out a night in Russia,
ANGELO:
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
ANGELO:
And leave you to the hearing of the cause,
ANGELO:
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
ESCALUS:
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
ESCALUS:
Exit ANGELO
ESCALUS:
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
POMPEY:
Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.
ELBOW:
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
POMPEY:
I beseech your honour, ask me.
ESCALUS:
Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
POMPEY:
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
POMPEY:
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour, 'tis for a
POMPEY:
good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?
ESCALUS:
Ay, sir, very well.
POMPEY:
Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.
ESCALUS:
Well, I do so.
POMPEY:
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
ESCALUS:
Why, no.
POMPEY:
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
POMPEY:
thing about him. Good, then, if his face be the
POMPEY:
worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
POMPEY:
constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
POMPEY:
your honour.
ESCALUS:
He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
ELBOW:
First, an it like you, the house is a respected
ELBOW:
house, next, this is a respected fellow, and his
ELBOW:
mistress is a respected woman.
POMPEY:
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
POMPEY:
person than any of us all.
ELBOW:
Varlet, thou liest, thou liest, wicked varlet! the
ELBOW:
time has yet to come that she was ever respected
ELBOW:
with man, woman, or child.
POMPEY:
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
ESCALUS:
Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
ESCALUS:
this true?
ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
ELBOW:
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
ELBOW:
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
ELBOW:
with me, let not your worship think me the poor
ELBOW:
duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
ELBOW:
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.
ESCALUS:
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
ESCALUS:
action of slander too.
ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
ELBOW:
your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
ESCALUS:
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
ESCALUS:
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
ESCALUS:
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
ESCALUS:
are.
ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
ELBOW:
wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
ELBOW:
to continue now, thou varlet, thou art to continue.
ESCALUS:
Where were you born, friend?
FROTH:
Here in Vienna, sir.
ESCALUS:
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
FROTH:
Yes, an't please you, sir.
ESCALUS:
So. What trade are you of, sir?
POMPHEY:
Tapster, a poor widow's tapster.
ESCALUS:
Your mistress' name?
POMPHEY:
Mistress Overdone.
ESCALUS:
Hath she had any more than one husband?
POMPEY:
Nine, sir, Overdone by the last.
ESCALUS:
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
ESCALUS:
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
ESCALUS:
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
ESCALUS:
will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
ESCALUS:
more of you.
FROTH:
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
FROTH:
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
FROTH:
in.
ESCALUS:
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
ESCALUS:
Exit FROTH
ESCALUS:
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
ESCALUS:
name, Master tapster?
POMPEY:
Pompey.
ESCALUS:
What else?
POMPEY:
Bum, sir.
ESCALUS:
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you,
ESCALUS:
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
ESCALUS:
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
ESCALUS:
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
ESCALUS:
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
POMPEY:
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
ESCALUS:
How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
ESCALUS:
do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?
POMPEY:
If the law would allow it, sir.
ESCALUS:
But the law will not allow it, Pompey, nor it shall
ESCALUS:
not be allowed in Vienna.
POMPEY:
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
POMPEY:
youth of the city?
ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.
POMPEY:
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
POMPEY:
If your worship will take order for the drabs and
POMPEY:
the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
ESCALUS:
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you
ESCALUS:
it is but heading and hanging.
POMPEY:
If you head and hang all that offend that way but
POMPEY:
for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
POMPEY:
commission for more heads: if this law hold in
POMPEY:
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
POMPEY:
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
POMPEY:
come to pass, say Pompey told you so.
ESCALUS:
Thank you, good Pompey, and, in requital of your
ESCALUS:
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
ESCALUS:
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever,
ESCALUS:
no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
ESCALUS:
I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
ESCALUS:
Caesar to you, in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
ESCALUS:
have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
POMPEY:
I thank your worship for your good counsel
POMPEY:
Aside
POMPEY:
but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
POMPEY:
better determine.
POMPEY:
Whip me? No, no, let carman whip his jade
POMPEY:
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.
POMPEY:
Exit
ESCALUS:
Come hither to me, Master Elbow, come hither, Master
ESCALUS:
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?
ELBOW:
Seven year and a half, sir.
ESCALUS:
I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
ESCALUS:
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?
ELBOW:
And a half, sir.
ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
ESCALUS:
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
ESCALUS:
in your ward sufficient to serve it?
ELBOW:
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
ELBOW:
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them, I
ELBOW:
do it for some piece of money, and go through with
ELBOW:
all.
ESCALUS:
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
ESCALUS:
the most sufficient of your parish.
ELBOW:
To your worship's house, sir?
ESCALUS:
To my house. Fare you well.
ESCALUS:
Exit ELBOW
ESCALUS:
What's o'clock, think you?
Justice:
Eleven, sir.
ESCALUS:
I pray you home to dinner with me.
Justice:
I humbly thank you.
ESCALUS:
It grieves me for the death of Claudio,
ESCALUS:
But there's no remedy.
Justice:
Lord Angelo is severe.
ESCALUS:
It is but needful
ESCALUS:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so,
ESCALUS:
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe
ESCALUS:
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
ESCALUS:
Come, sir.
ESCALUS:
Exeunt
ESCALUS:
SCENE II. Another room in the same.
ESCALUS:
Enter Provost and a Servant
Servant:
He's hearing of a cause, he will come straight
Servant:
I'll tell him of you.
Provost:
Pray you, do.
Provost:
Exit Servant
Provost:
I'll know
Provost:
His pleasure, may be he will relent. Alas,
Provost:
He hath but as offended in a dream!
Provost:
All sects, all ages smack of this vice, and he
Provost:
To die for't!
Provost:
Enter ANGELO
ANGELO:
Now, what's the matter. Provost?
Provost:
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
ANGELO:
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
ANGELO:
Why dost thou ask again?
Provost:
Lest I might be too rash
Provost:
Under your good correction, I have seen,
Provost:
When, after execution, judgment hath
Provost:
Repented o'er his doom.
ANGELO:
Go to, let that be mine
ANGELO:
Do you your office, or give up your place,
ANGELO:
And you shall well be spared.
Provost:
I crave your honour's pardon.
Provost:
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
Provost:
She's very near her hour.
ANGELO:
Dispose of her
ANGELO:
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
ANGELO:
Re-enter Servant
Servant:
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Servant:
Desires access to you.
ANGELO:
Hath he a sister?
Provost:
Ay, my good lord, a very virtuous maid,
Provost:
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
Provost:
If not already.
ANGELO:
Well, let her be admitted.
ANGELO:
Exit Servant
ANGELO:
See you the fornicatress be removed
ANGELO:
Let have needful, but not lavish, means,
ANGELO:
There shall be order for't.
ANGELO:
Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO
Provost:
God save your honour!
ANGELO:
Stay a little while.
ANGELO:
To ISABELLA
ANGELO:
You're welcome: what's your will?
ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
ISABELLA:
Please but your honour hear me.
ANGELO:
Well, what's your suit?
ISABELLA:
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
ISABELLA:
And most desire should meet the blow of justice,
ISABELLA:
For which I would not plead, but that I must,
ISABELLA:
For which I must not plead, but that I am
ISABELLA:
At war 'twixt will and will not.
ANGELO:
Well, the matter?
ISABELLA:
I have a brother is condemn'd to die
ISABELLA:
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
ISABELLA:
And not my brother.
Provost:
[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!
ANGELO:
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
ANGELO:
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done
ANGELO:
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
ANGELO:
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
ANGELO:
And let go by the actor.
ISABELLA:
O just but severe law!
ISABELLA:
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!
LUCIO:
[Aside to ISABELLA]  Give't not o'er so: to him
LUCIO:
again, entreat him,
LUCIO:
Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown
LUCIO:
You are too cold, if you should need a pin,
LUCIO:
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it
LUCIO:
To him, I say!
ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?
ANGELO:
Maiden, no remedy.
ISABELLA:
Yes, I do think that you might pardon him,
ISABELLA:
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
ANGELO:
I will not do't.
ISABELLA:
But can you, if you would?
ANGELO:
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
ISABELLA:
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
ISABELLA:
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
ISABELLA:
A s mine is to him?
ANGELO:
He's sentenced, 'tis too late.
LUCIO:
[Aside to ISABELLA]  You are too cold.
ISABELLA:
Too late? why, no, I, that do speak a word.
ISABELLA:
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
ISABELLA:
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
ISABELLA:
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
ISABELLA:
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
ISABELLA:
Become them with one half so good a grace
ISABELLA:
As mercy does.
ISABELLA:
If he had been as you and you as he,
ISABELLA:
You would have slipt like him, but he, like you,
ISABELLA:
Would not have been so stern.
ANGELO:
Pray you, be gone.
ISABELLA:
I would to heaven I had your potency,
ISABELLA:
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
ISABELLA:
No, I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
ISABELLA:
And what a prisoner.
LUCIO:
[Aside to ISABELLA]
LUCIO:
Ay, touch him, there's the vein.
ANGELO:
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
ANGELO:
And you but waste your words.
ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!
ISABELLA:
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once,
ISABELLA:
And He that might the vantage best have took
ISABELLA:
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
ISABELLA:
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
ISABELLA:
But judge you as you are? O, think on that,
ISABELLA:
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
ISABELLA:
Like man new made.
ANGELO:
Be you content, fair maid,
ANGELO:
It is the law, not I condemn your brother
ANGELO:
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
ANGELO:
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.
ISABELLA:
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
ISABELLA:
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
ISABELLA:
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
ISABELLA:
With less respect than we do minister
ISABELLA:
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you,
ISABELLA:
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
ISABELLA:
There's many have committed it.
LUCIO:
[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay, well said.
ANGELO:
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept
ANGELO:
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
ANGELO:
If the first that did the edict infringe
ANGELO:
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
ANGELO:
Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
ANGELO:
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
ANGELO:
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
ANGELO:
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
ANGELO:
Are now to have no successive degrees,
ANGELO:
But, ere they live, to end.
ISABELLA:
Yet show some pity.
ANGELO:
I show it most of all when I show justice,
ANGELO:
For then I pity those I do not know,
ANGELO:
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall,
ANGELO:
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
ANGELO:
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied,
ANGELO:
Your brother dies to-morrow, be content.
ISABELLA:
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
ISABELLA:
And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
ISABELLA:
To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous
ISABELLA:
To use it like a giant.
LUCIO:
[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.
ISABELLA:
Could great men thunder
ISABELLA:
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
ISABELLA:
For every pelting, petty officer
ISABELLA:
Would use his heaven for thunder,
ISABELLA:
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
ISABELLA:
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
ISABELLA:
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
ISABELLA:
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
ISABELLA:
Drest in a little brief authority,
ISABELLA:
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
ISABELLA:
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
ISABELLA:
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
ISABELLA:
As make the angels weep, who, with our spleens,
ISABELLA:
Would all themselves laugh mortal.
LUCIO:
[Aside to ISABELLA]  O, to him, to him, wench! he
LUCIO:
will relent,
LUCIO:
He's coming, I perceive 't.
Provost:
[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!
ISABELLA:
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself
ISABELLA:
Great men may jest with saints, 'tis wit in them,
ISABELLA:
But in the less foul profanation.
LUCIO:
Thou'rt i' the right, girl, more o, that.
ISABELLA:
That in the captain's but a choleric word,
ISABELLA:
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
LUCIO:
[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.
ANGELO:
Why do you put these sayings upon me?
ISABELLA:
Because authority, though it err like others,
ISABELLA:
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
ISABELLA:
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom,
ISABELLA:
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
ISABELLA:
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
ISABELLA:
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
ISABELLA:
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
ISABELLA:
Against my brother's life.
ANGELO:
[Aside]                  She speaks, and 'tis
ANGELO:
Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.
ISABELLA:
Gentle my lord, turn back.
ANGELO:
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
ISABELLA:
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
ANGELO:
How! bribe me?
ISABELLA:
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
LUCIO:
[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.
ISABELLA:
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
ISABELLA:
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
ISABELLA:
As fancy values them, but with true prayers
ISABELLA:
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
ISABELLA:
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
ISABELLA:
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
ISABELLA:
To nothing temporal.
ANGELO:
Well, come to me to-morrow.
LUCIO:
[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to, 'tis well, away!
ISABELLA:
Heaven keep your honour safe!
ANGELO:
[Aside]	Amen
ANGELO:
For I am that way going to temptation,
ANGELO:
Where prayers cross.
ISABELLA:
At what hour to-morrow
ISABELLA:
Shall I attend your lordship?
ANGELO:
At any time 'fore noon.
ISABELLA:
'Save your honour!
ISABELLA:
Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost
ANGELO:
From thee, even from thy virtue!
ANGELO:
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
ANGELO:
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
ANGELO:
Ha!
ANGELO:
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
ANGELO:
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
ANGELO:
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
ANGELO:
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
ANGELO:
That modesty may more betray our sense
ANGELO:
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
ANGELO:
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
ANGELO:
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
ANGELO:
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
ANGELO:
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
ANGELO:
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
ANGELO:
Thieves for their robbery have authority
ANGELO:
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
ANGELO:
That I desire to hear her speak again,
ANGELO:
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
ANGELO:
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
ANGELO:
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
ANGELO:
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
ANGELO:
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
ANGELO:
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
ANGELO:
Once stir my temper, but this virtuous maid
ANGELO:
Subdues me quite. Even till now,
ANGELO:
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.
ANGELO:
Exit
ANGELO:
SCENE III. A room in a prison.
ANGELO:
Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar, and Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.
Provost:
I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To let me see them and to make me know
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To them accordingly.
Provost:
I would do more than that, if more were needful.
Provost:
Enter JULIET
Provost:
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
Provost:
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
Provost:
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child,
Provost:
And he that got it, sentenced, a young man
Provost:
More fit to do another such offence
Provost:
Than die for this.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
When must he die?
Provost:
As I do think, to-morrow.
Provost:
I have provided for you: stay awhile,
Provost:
To JULIET
Provost:
And you shall be conducted.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
JULIET:
I do, and bear the shame most patiently.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And try your penitence, if it be sound,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Or hollowly put on.
JULIET:
I'll gladly learn.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love you the man that wrong'd you?
JULIET:
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then it seems your most offenceful act
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Was mutually committed?
JULIET:
Mutually.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
JULIET:
I do confess it, and repent it, father.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But as we stand in fear,--
JULIET:
I do repent me, as it is an evil,
JULIET:
And take the shame with joy.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And I am going with instruction to him.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Grace go with you, Benedicite!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exit
JULIET:
Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
JULIET:
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
JULIET:
Is still a dying horror!
Provost:
'Tis pity of him.
Provost:
Exeunt
Provost:
SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.
Provost:
Enter ANGELO
ANGELO:
When I would pray and think, I think and pray
ANGELO:
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
ANGELO:
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
ANGELO:
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
ANGELO:
As if I did but only chew his name,
ANGELO:
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
ANGELO:
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
ANGELO:
Is like a good thing, being often read,
ANGELO:
Grown fear'd and tedious, yea, my gravity,
ANGELO:
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
ANGELO:
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
ANGELO:
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
ANGELO:
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
ANGELO:
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
ANGELO:
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood
ANGELO:
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn
ANGELO:
'Tis not the devil's crest.
ANGELO:
Enter a Servant
ANGELO:
How now! who's there?
Servant:
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
ANGELO:
Teach her the way.
ANGELO:
Exit Servant
ANGELO:
O heavens!
ANGELO:
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
ANGELO:
Making both it unable for itself,
ANGELO:
And dispossessing all my other parts
ANGELO:
Of necessary fitness?
ANGELO:
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons,
ANGELO:
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
ANGELO:
By which he should revive: and even so
ANGELO:
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
ANGELO:
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
ANGELO:
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
ANGELO:
Must needs appear offence.
ANGELO:
Enter ISABELLA
ANGELO:
How now, fair maid?
ISABELLA:
I am come to know your pleasure.
ANGELO:
That you might know it, would much better please me
ANGELO:
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
ANGELO:
As long as you or I yet he must die.
ISABELLA:
Under your sentence?
ANGELO:
Yea.
ISABELLA:
When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
ISABELLA:
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
ISABELLA:
That his soul sicken not.
ANGELO:
Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
ANGELO:
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
ANGELO:
A man already made, as to remit
ANGELO:
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
ANGELO:
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
ANGELO:
Falsely to take away a life true made
ANGELO:
As to put metal in restrained means
ANGELO:
To make a false one.
ISABELLA:
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
ANGELO:
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
ANGELO:
Which had you rather, that the most just law
ANGELO:
Now took your brother's life, or, to redeem him,
ANGELO:
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
ANGELO:
As she that he hath stain'd?
ISABELLA:
Sir, believe this,
ISABELLA:
I had rather give my body than my soul.
ANGELO:
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
ANGELO:
Stand more for number than for accompt.
ISABELLA:
How say you?
ANGELO:
Nay, I'll not warrant that, for I can speak
ANGELO:
Against the thing I say. Answer to this
ANGELO:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
ANGELO:
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life
ANGELO:
Might there not be a charity in sin
ANGELO:
To save this brother's life?
ISABELLA:
Please you to do't,
ISABELLA:
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
ISABELLA:
It is no sin at all, but charity.
ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
ANGELO:
Were equal poise of sin and charity.
ISABELLA:
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
ISABELLA:
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
ISABELLA:
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
ISABELLA:
To have it added to the faults of mine,
ISABELLA:
And nothing of your answer.
ANGELO:
Nay, but hear me.
ANGELO:
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
ANGELO:
Or seem so craftily, and that's not good.
ISABELLA:
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
ISABELLA:
But graciously to know I am no better.
ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
ANGELO:
When it doth tax itself, as these black masks
ANGELO:
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
ANGELO:
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me,
ANGELO:
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross
ANGELO:
Your brother is to die.
ISABELLA:
So.
ANGELO:
And his offence is so, as it appears,
ANGELO:
Accountant to the law upon that pain.
ISABELLA:
True.
ANGELO:
Admit no other way to save his life,--
ANGELO:
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
ANGELO:
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
ANGELO:
Finding yourself desired of such a person,
ANGELO:
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
ANGELO:
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
ANGELO:
Of the all-building law, and that there were
ANGELO:
No earthly mean to save him, but that either
ANGELO:
You must lay down the treasures of your body
ANGELO:
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer,
ANGELO:
What would you do?
ISABELLA:
As much for my poor brother as myself
ISABELLA:
That is, were I under the terms of death,
ISABELLA:
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
ISABELLA:
And strip myself to death, as to a bed
ISABELLA:
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
ISABELLA:
My body up to shame.
ANGELO:
Then must your brother die.
ISABELLA:
And 'twere the cheaper way
ISABELLA:
Better it were a brother died at once,
ISABELLA:
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
ISABELLA:
Should die for ever.
ANGELO:
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
ANGELO:
That you have slander'd so?
ISABELLA:
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
ISABELLA:
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
ISABELLA:
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
ANGELO:
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant,
ANGELO:
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
ANGELO:
A merriment than a vice.
ISABELLA:
O, pardon me, my lord, it oft falls out,
ISABELLA:
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean
ISABELLA:
I something do excuse the thing I hate,
ISABELLA:
For his advantage that I dearly love.
ANGELO:
We are all frail.
ISABELLA:
Else let my brother die,
ISABELLA:
If not a feodary, but only he
ISABELLA:
Owe and succeed thy weakness.
ANGELO:
Nay, women are frail too.
ISABELLA:
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
ISABELLA:
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
ISABELLA:
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
ISABELLA:
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail,
ISABELLA:
For we are soft as our complexions are,
ISABELLA:
And credulous to false prints.
ANGELO:
I think it well
ANGELO:
And from this testimony of your own sex,--
ANGELO:
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
ANGELO:
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold,
ANGELO:
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
ANGELO:
That is, a woman, if you be more, you're none,
ANGELO:
If you be one, as you are well express'd
ANGELO:
By all external warrants, show it now,
ANGELO:
By putting on the destined livery.
ISABELLA:
I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
ISABELLA:
Let me entreat you speak the former language.
ANGELO:
Plainly conceive, I love you.
ISABELLA:
My brother did love Juliet,
ISABELLA:
And you tell me that he shall die for it.
ANGELO:
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
ISABELLA:
I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
ISABELLA:
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
ISABELLA:
To pluck on others.
ANGELO:
Believe me, on mine honour,
ANGELO:
My words express my purpose.
ISABELLA:
Ha! little honour to be much believed,
ISABELLA:
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
ISABELLA:
I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for't
ISABELLA:
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
ISABELLA:
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
ISABELLA:
What man thou art.
ANGELO:
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
ANGELO:
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
ANGELO:
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
ANGELO:
Will so your accusation overweigh,
ANGELO:
That you shall stifle in your own report
ANGELO:
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
ANGELO:
And now I give my sensual race the rein
ANGELO:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite,
ANGELO:
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
ANGELO:
That banish what they sue for, redeem thy brother
ANGELO:
By yielding up thy body to my will,
ANGELO:
Or else he must not only die the death,
ANGELO:
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
ANGELO:
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
ANGELO:
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
ANGELO:
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
ANGELO:
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
ANGELO:
Exit
ISABELLA:
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
ISABELLA:
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
ISABELLA:
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
ISABELLA:
Either of condemnation or approof,
ISABELLA:
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will
ISABELLA:
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
ISABELLA:
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother
ISABELLA:
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
ISABELLA:
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
ISABELLA:
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
ISABELLA:
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
ISABELLA:
Before his sister should her body stoop
ISABELLA:
To such abhorr'd pollution.
ISABELLA:
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die
ISABELLA:
More than our brother is our chastity.
ISABELLA:
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
ISABELLA:
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.
ISABELLA:
Exit
ISABELLA:
ACT III
ISABELLA:
SCENE I. A room in the prison.
ISABELLA:
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
CLAUDIO:
The miserable have no other medicine
CLAUDIO:
But only hope
CLAUDIO:
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be absolute for death, either death or life
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life
DUKE VINCENTIO:
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Servile to all the skyey influences,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And that thou oft provokest, yet grossly fear'st
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dreaming on both, for all thy blessed youth
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of palsied eld, and when thou art old and rich,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That makes these odds all even.
CLAUDIO:
I humbly thank you.
CLAUDIO:
To sue to live, I find I seek to die,
CLAUDIO:
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
ISABELLA:
[Within]  What, ho! Peace here, grace and good company!
Provost:
Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank you.
CLAUDIO:
Enter ISABELLA
ISABELLA:
My business is a word or two with Claudio.
Provost:
And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with you.
Provost:
As many as you please.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost
CLAUDIO:
Now, sister, what's the comfort?
ISABELLA:
Why,
ISABELLA:
As all comforts are, most good, most good indeed.
ISABELLA:
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
ISABELLA:
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
ISABELLA:
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger
ISABELLA:
Therefore your best appointment make with speed,
ISABELLA:
To-morrow you set on.
CLAUDIO:
Is there no remedy?
ISABELLA:
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
ISABELLA:
To cleave a heart in twain.
CLAUDIO:
But is there any?
ISABELLA:
Yes, brother, you may live
ISABELLA:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
ISABELLA:
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
ISABELLA:
But fetter you till death.
CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance?
ISABELLA:
Ay, just, perpetual durance, a restraint,
ISABELLA:
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
ISABELLA:
To a determined scope.
CLAUDIO:
But in what nature?
ISABELLA:
In such a one as, you consenting to't,
ISABELLA:
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
ISABELLA:
And leave you naked.
CLAUDIO:
Let me know the point.
ISABELLA:
O, I do fear thee, Claudio, and I quake,
ISABELLA:
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
ISABELLA:
And six or seven winters more respect
ISABELLA:
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
ISABELLA:
The sense of death is most in apprehension,
ISABELLA:
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
ISABELLA:
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
ISABELLA:
As when a giant dies.
CLAUDIO:
Why give you me this shame?
CLAUDIO:
Think you I can a resolution fetch
CLAUDIO:
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
CLAUDIO:
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
CLAUDIO:
And hug it in mine arms.
ISABELLA:
There spake my brother, there my father's grave
ISABELLA:
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die
ISABELLA:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
ISABELLA:
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
ISABELLA:
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
ISABELLA:
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
ISABELLA:
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
ISABELLA:
His filth within being cast, he would appear
ISABELLA:
A pond as deep as hell.
CLAUDIO:
The prenzie Angelo!
ISABELLA:
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
ISABELLA:
The damned'st body to invest and cover
ISABELLA:
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
ISABELLA:
If I would yield him my virginity,
ISABELLA:
Thou mightst be freed.
CLAUDIO:
O heavens! it cannot be.
ISABELLA:
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
ISABELLA:
So to offend him still. This night's the time
ISABELLA:
That I should do what I abhor to name,
ISABELLA:
Or else thou diest to-morrow.
CLAUDIO:
Thou shalt not do't.
ISABELLA:
O, were it but my life,
ISABELLA:
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
ISABELLA:
As frankly as a pin.
CLAUDIO:
Thanks, dear Isabel.
ISABELLA:
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
CLAUDIO:
Yes. Has he affections in him,
CLAUDIO:
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
CLAUDIO:
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
CLAUDIO:
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.
ISABELLA:
Which is the least?
CLAUDIO:
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
CLAUDIO:
Why would he for the momentary trick
CLAUDIO:
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!
ISABELLA:
What says my brother?
CLAUDIO:
Death is a fearful thing.
ISABELLA:
And shamed life a hateful.
CLAUDIO:
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where,
CLAUDIO:
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot,
CLAUDIO:
This sensible warm motion to become
CLAUDIO:
A kneaded clod, and the delighted spirit
CLAUDIO:
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
CLAUDIO:
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice,
CLAUDIO:
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
CLAUDIO:
And blown with restless violence round about
CLAUDIO:
The pendent world, or to be worse than worst
CLAUDIO:
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
CLAUDIO:
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
CLAUDIO:
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
CLAUDIO:
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
CLAUDIO:
Can lay on nature is a paradise
CLAUDIO:
To what we fear of death.
ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!
CLAUDIO:
Sweet sister, let me live
CLAUDIO:
What sin you do to save a brother's life,
CLAUDIO:
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
CLAUDIO:
That it becomes a virtue.
ISABELLA:
O you beast!
ISABELLA:
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
ISABELLA:
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
ISABELLA:
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
ISABELLA:
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
ISABELLA:
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
ISABELLA:
For such a warped slip of wilderness
ISABELLA:
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
ISABELLA:
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
ISABELLA:
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed
ISABELLA:
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
ISABELLA:
No word to save thee.
CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear me, Isabel.
ISABELLA:
O, fie, fie, fie!
ISABELLA:
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
ISABELLA:
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
ISABELLA:
'Tis best thou diest quickly.
CLAUDIO:
O hear me, Isabella!
CLAUDIO:
Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
ISABELLA:
What is your will?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
DUKE VINCENTIO:
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
DUKE VINCENTIO:
would require is likewise your own benefit.
ISABELLA:
I have no superfluous leisure, my stay must be
ISABELLA:
stolen out of other affairs, but I will attend you awhile.
ISABELLA:
Walks apart
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
DUKE VINCENTIO:
corrupt her, only he hath made an essay of her
DUKE VINCENTIO:
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
DUKE VINCENTIO:
of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
DUKE VINCENTIO:
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
DUKE VINCENTIO:
know this to be true, therefore prepare yourself to
DUKE VINCENTIO:
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
DUKE VINCENTIO:
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die, go to
DUKE VINCENTIO:
your knees and make ready.
CLAUDIO:
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
CLAUDIO:
with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hold you there: farewell.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exit CLAUDIO
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with you!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Re-enter Provost
Provost:
What's your will, father
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
DUKE VINCENTIO:
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
DUKE VINCENTIO:
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.
Provost:
In good time.
Provost:
Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good
DUKE VINCENTIO:
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
DUKE VINCENTIO:
brief in goodness, but grace, being the soul of
DUKE VINCENTIO:
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
DUKE VINCENTIO:
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding, and, but
DUKE VINCENTIO:
that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
DUKE VINCENTIO:
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
DUKE VINCENTIO:
substitute, and to save your brother?
ISABELLA:
I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
ISABELLA:
brother die by the law than my son should be
ISABELLA:
unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
ISABELLA:
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
ISABELLA:
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
ISABELLA:
discover his government.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
DUKE VINCENTIO:
now stands, he will avoid your accusation, he made
DUKE VINCENTIO:
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
DUKE VINCENTIO:
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
DUKE VINCENTIO:
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
DUKE VINCENTIO:
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
DUKE VINCENTIO:
lady a merited benefit, redeem your brother from
DUKE VINCENTIO:
the angry law, do no stain to your own gracious
DUKE VINCENTIO:
person, and much please the absent duke, if
DUKE VINCENTIO:
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
DUKE VINCENTIO:
this business.
ISABELLA:
Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
ISABELLA:
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
DUKE VINCENTIO:
you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
ISABELLA:
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should this Angelo have married, was affianced
DUKE VINCENTIO:
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
DUKE VINCENTIO:
which time of the contract and limit of the
DUKE VINCENTIO:
solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
DUKE VINCENTIO:
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
DUKE VINCENTIO:
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
DUKE VINCENTIO:
renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
DUKE VINCENTIO:
kind and natural, with him, the portion and sinew of
DUKE VINCENTIO:
her fortune, her marriage-dowry, with both, her
DUKE VINCENTIO:
combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
ISABELLA:
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
DUKE VINCENTIO:
with his comfort, swallowed his vows whole,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
DUKE VINCENTIO:
wears for his sake, and he, a marble to her tears,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
is washed with them, but relents not.
ISABELLA:
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
ISABELLA:
from the world! What corruption in this life, that
ISABELLA:
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
DUKE VINCENTIO:
cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
DUKE VINCENTIO:
you from dishonour in doing it.
ISABELLA:
Show me how, good father.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
DUKE VINCENTIO:
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
DUKE VINCENTIO:
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
like an impediment in the current, made it more
DUKE VINCENTIO:
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo, answer his
DUKE VINCENTIO:
requiring with a plausible obedience, agree with
DUKE VINCENTIO:
his demands to the point, only refer yourself to
DUKE VINCENTIO:
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
DUKE VINCENTIO:
not be long, that the time may have all shadow and
DUKE VINCENTIO:
silence in it, and the place answer to convenience.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
This being granted in course,--and now follows
DUKE VINCENTIO:
all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
DUKE VINCENTIO:
your appointment, go in your place, if the encounter
DUKE VINCENTIO:
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
DUKE VINCENTIO:
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
DUKE VINCENTIO:
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
DUKE VINCENTIO:
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
DUKE VINCENTIO:
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
DUKE VINCENTIO:
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What think you of it?
ISABELLA:
The image of it gives me content already, and I
ISABELLA:
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
DUKE VINCENTIO:
to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
DUKE VINCENTIO:
bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
DUKE VINCENTIO:
presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
DUKE VINCENTIO:
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
DUKE VINCENTIO:
place call upon me, and dispatch with Angelo, that
DUKE VINCENTIO:
it may be quickly.
ISABELLA:
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
ISABELLA:
Exeunt severally
ISABELLA:
SCENE II. The street before the prison.
ISABELLA:
Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY
ELBOW:
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
ELBOW:
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
ELBOW:
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O heavens! what stuff is here
POMPEY:
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
POMPEY:
merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
POMPEY:
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm, and
POMPEY:
furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
POMPEY:
craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.
ELBOW:
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you, good brother father. What offence hath
DUKE VINCENTIO:
this man made you, sir?
ELBOW:
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
ELBOW:
take him to be a thief too, sir, for we have found
ELBOW:
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
ELBOW:
sent to the deputy.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The evil that thou causest to be done,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
DUKE VINCENTIO:
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
From their abominable and beastly touches
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
POMPEY:
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir, but yet,
POMPEY:
sir, I would prove--
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Correction and instruction must both work
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ere this rude beast will profit.
ELBOW:
He must before the deputy, sir, he has given him
ELBOW:
warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
ELBOW:
he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
ELBOW:
as good go a mile on his errand.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we were all, as some would seem to be,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
ELBOW:
His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.
POMPEY:
I spy comfort, I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
POMPEY:
friend of mine.
POMPEY:
Enter LUCIO
LUCIO:
How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
LUCIO:
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
LUCIO:
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
LUCIO:
had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
LUCIO:
extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
LUCIO:
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
LUCIO:
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
LUCIO:
thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
LUCIO:
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
LUCIO:
trick of it?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Still thus, and thus, still worse!
LUCIO:
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
LUCIO:
still, ha?
POMPEY:
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
POMPEY:
is herself in the tub.
LUCIO:
Why, 'tis good, it is the right of it, it must be
LUCIO:
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd
LUCIO:
an unshunned consequence, it must be so. Art going
LUCIO:
to prison, Pompey?
POMPEY:
Yes, faith, sir.
LUCIO:
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
LUCIO:
sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?
ELBOW:
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
LUCIO:
Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
LUCIO:
due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
LUCIO:
doubtless, and of antiquity too, bawd-born.
LUCIO:
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
LUCIO:
Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey, you
LUCIO:
will keep the house.
POMPEY:
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
LUCIO:
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey, it is not the wear.
LUCIO:
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
LUCIO:
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
LUCIO:
more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you.
LUCIO:
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir, come.
POMPEY:
You will not bail me, then, sir?
LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
LUCIO:
what news?
ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir, come.
LUCIO:
Go to kennel, Pompey, go.
LUCIO:
Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers
LUCIO:
What news, friar, of the duke?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know none. Can you tell me of any?
LUCIO:
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia, other
LUCIO:
some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know not where, but wheresoever, I wish him well.
LUCIO:
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
LUCIO:
the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
LUCIO:
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence, he
LUCIO:
puts transgression to 't.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.
LUCIO:
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
LUCIO:
him: something too crabbed that way, friar.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
LUCIO:
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred,
LUCIO:
it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
LUCIO:
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
LUCIO:
down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
LUCIO:
woman after this downright way of creation: is it
LUCIO:
true, think you?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
How should he be made, then?
LUCIO:
Some report a sea-maid spawned him, some, that he
LUCIO:
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
LUCIO:
certain that when he makes water his urine is
LUCIO:
congealed ice, that I know to be true: and he is a
LUCIO:
motion generative, that's infallible.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
LUCIO:
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
LUCIO:
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
LUCIO:
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
LUCIO:
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
LUCIO:
hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
LUCIO:
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
LUCIO:
knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
DUKE VINCENTIO:
women, he was not inclined that way.
LUCIO:
O, sir, you are deceived.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis not possible.
LUCIO:
Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty, and
LUCIO:
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
LUCIO:
duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too,
LUCIO:
that let me inform you.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do him wrong, surely.
LUCIO:
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
LUCIO:
duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
LUCIO:
withdrawing.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, I prithee, might be the cause?
LUCIO:
No, pardon, 'tis a secret must be locked within the
LUCIO:
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
LUCIO:
understand, the greater file of the subject held the
LUCIO:
duke to be wise.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no question but he was.
LUCIO:
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking
DUKE VINCENTIO:
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
DUKE VINCENTIO:
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
DUKE VINCENTIO:
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
DUKE VINCENTIO:
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
DUKE VINCENTIO:
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
DUKE VINCENTIO:
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.
LUCIO:
Sir, I know him, and I love him.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
DUKE VINCENTIO:
dearer love.
LUCIO:
Come, sir, I know what I know.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
DUKE VINCENTIO:
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
DUKE VINCENTIO:
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
DUKE VINCENTIO:
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
DUKE VINCENTIO:
upon you, and, I pray you, your name?
LUCIO:
Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the duke.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
DUKE VINCENTIO:
report you.
LUCIO:
I fear you not.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you hope the duke will return no more, or you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
DUKE VINCENTIO:
can do you little harm, you'll forswear this again.
LUCIO:
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
LUCIO:
friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
LUCIO:
Claudio die to-morrow or no?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why should he die, sir?
LUCIO:
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
LUCIO:
the duke we talk of were returned again: the
LUCIO:
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
LUCIO:
continency, sparrows must not build in his
LUCIO:
house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
LUCIO:
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered, he would
LUCIO:
never bring them to light: would he were returned!
LUCIO:
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
LUCIO:
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
LUCIO:
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
LUCIO:
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
LUCIO:
he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
LUCIO:
bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.
LUCIO:
Exit
DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness in mortality
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Can censure 'scape, back-wounding calumny
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But who comes here?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
ESCALUS:
Go, away with her to prison!
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Good my lord, be good to me, your honour is accounted
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
a merciful man, good my lord.
ESCALUS:
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
ESCALUS:
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
ESCALUS:
the tyrant.
Provost:
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
Provost:
your honour.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
duke's time, he promised her marriage: his child
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
I have kept it myself, and see how he goes about to abuse me!
ESCALUS:
That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
ESCALUS:
called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to,
ESCALUS:
no more words.
ESCALUS:
Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
ESCALUS:
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered,
ESCALUS:
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
ESCALUS:
with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
ESCALUS:
if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
ESCALUS:
so with him.
Provost:
So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
Provost:
advised him for the entertainment of death.
ESCALUS:
Good even, good father.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bliss and goodness on you!
ESCALUS:
Of whence are you?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not of this country, though my chance is now
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To use it for my time: I am a brother
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of gracious order, late come from the See
DUKE VINCENTIO:
In special business from his holiness.
ESCALUS:
What news abroad i' the world?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
None, but that there is so great a fever on
DUKE VINCENTIO:
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it
DUKE VINCENTIO:
novelty is only in request, and it is as dangerous
DUKE VINCENTIO:
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
DUKE VINCENTIO:
to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
DUKE VINCENTIO:
truth enough alive to make societies secure, but
DUKE VINCENTIO:
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
DUKE VINCENTIO:
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
DUKE VINCENTIO:
news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
DUKE VINCENTIO:
pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?
ESCALUS:
One that, above all other strifes, contended
ESCALUS:
especially to know himself.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What pleasure was he given to?
ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
ESCALUS:
any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
ESCALUS:
gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
ESCALUS:
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous,
ESCALUS:
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
ESCALUS:
prepared. I am made to understand that you have
ESCALUS:
lent him visitation.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He professes to have received no sinister measure
DUKE VINCENTIO:
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
DUKE VINCENTIO:
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
DUKE VINCENTIO:
to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
DUKE VINCENTIO:
deceiving promises of life, which I by my good
DUKE VINCENTIO:
leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
DUKE VINCENTIO:
resolved to die.
ESCALUS:
You have paid the heavens your function, and the
ESCALUS:
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
ESCALUS:
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
ESCALUS:
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
ESCALUS:
found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
ESCALUS:
he is indeed Justice.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his own life answer the straitness of his
DUKE VINCENTIO:
proceeding, it shall become him well, wherein if he
DUKE VINCENTIO:
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.
ESCALUS:
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Peace be with you!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He who the sword of heaven will bear
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Should be as holy as severe,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pattern in himself to know,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Grace to stand, and virtue go,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
More nor less to others paying
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Than by self-offences weighing.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Shame to him whose cruel striking
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Kills for faults of his own liking!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To weed my vice and let his grow!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, what may man within him hide,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Though angel on the outward side!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
How may likeness made in crimes,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Making practise on the times,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To draw with idle spiders' strings
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most ponderous and substantial things!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Craft against vice I must apply
DUKE VINCENTIO:
With Angelo to-night shall lie
DUKE VINCENTIO:
His old betrothed but despised,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And perform an old contracting.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exit
DUKE VINCENTIO:
ACT IV
DUKE VINCENTIO:
SCENE I. The moated grange at ST. LUKE's.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter MARIANA and a Boy
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Boy sings
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, O, take those lips away,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That so sweetly were forsworn,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And those eyes, the break of day,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Lights that do mislead the morn
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But my kisses bring again, bring again,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.
MARIANA:
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away
MARIANA:
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
MARIANA:
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
MARIANA:
Exit Boy
MARIANA:
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
MARIANA:
I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish
MARIANA:
You had not found me here so musical
MARIANA:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
MARIANA:
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis good, though music oft hath such a charm
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
DUKE VINCENTIO:
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I promised here to meet.
MARIANA:
You have not been inquired after
MARIANA:
I have sat here all day.
MARIANA:
Enter ISABELLA
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
DUKE VINCENTIO:
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
DUKE VINCENTIO:
be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.
MARIANA:
I am always bound to you.
MARIANA:
Exit
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Very well met, and well come.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is the news from this good deputy?
ISABELLA:
He hath a garden circummured with brick,
ISABELLA:
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd,
ISABELLA:
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
ISABELLA:
That makes his opening with this bigger key
ISABELLA:
This other doth command a little door
ISABELLA:
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads,
ISABELLA:
There have I made my promise
ISABELLA:
Upon the heavy middle of the night
ISABELLA:
To call upon him.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
ISABELLA:
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't
ISABELLA:
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
ISABELLA:
In action all of precept, he did show me
ISABELLA:
The way twice o'er.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are there no other tokens
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?
ISABELLA:
No, none, but only a repair i' the dark,
ISABELLA:
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
ISABELLA:
Can be but brief, for I have made him know
ISABELLA:
I have a servant comes with me along,
ISABELLA:
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
ISABELLA:
I come about my brother.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis well borne up.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I have not yet made known to Mariana
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Re-enter MARIANA
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
She comes to do you good.
ISABELLA:
I do desire the like.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
MARIANA:
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The vaporous night approaches.
MARIANA:
Will't please you walk aside?
MARIANA:
Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And rack thee in their fancies.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Welcome, how agreed?
ISABELLA:
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
ISABELLA:
If you advise it.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not my consent,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But my entreaty too.
ISABELLA:
Little have you to say
ISABELLA:
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
ISABELLA:
'Remember now my brother.'
MARIANA:
Fear me not.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He is your husband on a pre-contract
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sith that the justice of your title to him
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exeunt
DUKE VINCENTIO:
SCENE II. A room in the prison.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter Provost and POMPEY
Provost:
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?
POMPEY:
If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can, but if he be a
POMPEY:
married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
POMPEY:
cut off a woman's head.
Provost:
Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
Provost:
direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
Provost:
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
Provost:
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
Provost:
you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
Provost:
redeem you from your gyves, if not, you shall have
Provost:
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
Provost:
with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
Provost:
notorious bawd.
POMPEY:
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind,
POMPEY:
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
POMPEY:
would be glad to receive some instruction from my
POMPEY:
fellow partner.
Provost:
What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?
Provost:
Enter ABHORSON
ABHORSON:
Do you call, sir?
Provost:
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
Provost:
your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
Provost:
him by the year, and let him abide here with you, if
Provost:
not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
Provost:
cannot plead his estimation with you, he hath been a bawd.
ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.
Provost:
Go to, sir, you weigh equally, a feather will turn
Provost:
the scale.
Provost:
Exit
POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
POMPEY:
good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
POMPEY:
look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?
ABHORSON:
Ay, sir, a mystery
POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery, and
POMPEY:
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
POMPEY:
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery
POMPEY:
but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
POMPEY:
should be hanged, I cannot imagine.
ABHORSON:
Sir, it is a mystery.
POMPEY:
Proof?
ABHORSON:
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
ABHORSON:
too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
ABHORSON:
big enough, if it be too big for your thief, your
ABHORSON:
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
ABHORSON:
apparel fits your thief.
ABHORSON:
Re-enter Provost
Provost:
Are you agreed?
POMPEY:
Sir, I will serve him, for I do find your hangman is
POMPEY:
a more penitent trade than your bawd, he doth
POMPEY:
oftener ask forgiveness.
Provost:
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
Provost:
to-morrow four o'clock.
ABHORSON:
Come on, bawd, I will instruct thee in my trade, follow.
POMPEY:
I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
POMPEY:
occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
POMPEY:
me yare, for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
POMPEY:
a good turn.
Provost:
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio
Provost:
Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON
Provost:
The one has my pity, not a jot the other,
Provost:
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
Provost:
Enter CLAUDIO
Provost:
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death
Provost:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Provost:
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
CLAUDIO:
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones
CLAUDIO:
He will not wake.
Provost:
Who can do good on him?
Provost:
Well, go, prepare yourself.
Provost:
Knocking within
Provost:
But, hark, what noise?
Provost:
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
Provost:
Exit CLAUDIO
Provost:
By and by.
Provost:
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
Provost:
For the most gentle Claudio.
Provost:
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
Provost:
Welcome father.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?
Provost:
None, since the curfew rung.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not Isabel?
Provost:
No.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
They will, then, ere't be long.
Provost:
What comfort is for Claudio?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
There's some in hope.
Provost:
It is a bitter deputy.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so, his life is parallel'd
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That in himself which he spurs on his power
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But this being so, he's just.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Knocking within
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Now are they come.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exit Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is a gentle provost: seldom when
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Knocking within
DUKE VINCENTIO:
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Re-enter Provost
Provost:
There he must stay until the officer
Provost:
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But he must die to-morrow?
Provost:
None, sir, none.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall hear more ere morning.
Provost:
Happily
Provost:
You something know, yet I believe there comes
Provost:
No countermand, no such example have we
Provost:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Provost:
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Provost:
Profess'd the contrary.
Provost:
Enter a Messenger
Provost:
This is his lordship's man.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And here comes Claudio's pardon.
Messenger:
[Giving a paper]
Messenger:
My lord hath sent you this note, and by me this
Messenger:
further charge, that you swerve not from the
Messenger:
smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
Messenger:
other circumstance. Good morrow, for, as I take it,
Messenger:
it is almost day.
Provost:
I shall obey him.
Provost:
Exit Messenger
DUKE VINCENTIO:
[Aside]  This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which the pardoner himself is in.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
When it is born in high authority
DUKE VINCENTIO:
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Now, sir, what news?
Provost:
I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
Provost:
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
Provost:
putting-on, methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pray you, let's hear.
Provost:
[Reads]
Provost:
'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
Provost:
Claudio be executed by four of the clock, and in the
Provost:
afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,
Provost:
let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let
Provost:
this be duly performed, with a thought that more
Provost:
depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail
Provost:
not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
Provost:
What say you to this, sir?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
DUKE VINCENTIO:
afternoon?
Provost:
A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred, one
Provost:
that is a prisoner nine years old.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
How came it that the absent duke had not either
DUKE VINCENTIO:
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
DUKE VINCENTIO:
have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
Provost:
His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
Provost:
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
Provost:
Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is now apparent?
Provost:
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
DUKE VINCENTIO:
seems he to be touched?
Provost:
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
Provost:
as a drunken sleep, careless, reckless, and fearless
Provost:
of what's past, present, or to come, insensible of
Provost:
mortality, and desperately mortal.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He wants advice.
Provost:
He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
Provost:
of the prison, give him leave to escape hence, he
Provost:
would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
Provost:
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
Provost:
to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
Provost:
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
DUKE VINCENTIO:
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me, but, in the
DUKE VINCENTIO:
boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
DUKE VINCENTIO:
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
DUKE VINCENTIO:
sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
DUKE VINCENTIO:
manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
DUKE VINCENTIO:
dangerous courtesy.
Provost:
Pray, sir, in what?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
In the delaying death.
Provost:
A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
Provost:
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
Provost:
his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
Provost:
as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
DUKE VINCENTIO:
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
DUKE VINCENTIO:
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.
Provost:
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, death's a great disguiser, and you may add to it.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Shave the head, and tie the beard, and say it was
DUKE VINCENTIO:
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
DUKE VINCENTIO:
death: you know the course is common. If any thing
DUKE VINCENTIO:
fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
DUKE VINCENTIO:
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
DUKE VINCENTIO:
against it with my life.
Provost:
Pardon me, good father, it is against my oath.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?
Provost:
To him, and to his substitutes.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
DUKE VINCENTIO:
avouch the justice of your dealing?
Provost:
But what likelihood is in that?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
DUKE VINCENTIO:
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
DUKE VINCENTIO:
persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
DUKE VINCENTIO:
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
DUKE VINCENTIO:
duke: you know the character, I doubt not, and the
DUKE VINCENTIO:
signet is not strange to you.
Provost:
I know them both.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
shall find, within these two days he will be here.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is a thing that Angelo knows not, for he this
DUKE VINCENTIO:
very day receives letters of strange tenor,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
perchance of the duke's death, perchance entering
DUKE VINCENTIO:
into some monastery, but, by chance, nothing of what
DUKE VINCENTIO:
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
DUKE VINCENTIO:
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
DUKE VINCENTIO:
things should be: all difficulties are but easy
DUKE VINCENTIO:
when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
DUKE VINCENTIO:
with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
DUKE VINCENTIO:
shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
are amazed, but this shall absolutely resolve you.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come away, it is almost clear dawn.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exeunt
DUKE VINCENTIO:
SCENE III. Another room in the same.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter POMPEY
POMPEY:
I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
POMPEY:
of profession: one would think it were Mistress
POMPEY:
Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
POMPEY:
customers. First, here's young Master Rash, he's in
POMPEY:
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
POMPEY:
ninescore and seventeen pounds, of which he made
POMPEY:
five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
POMPEY:
much in request, for the old women were all dead.
POMPEY:
Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
POMPEY:
Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
POMPEY:
peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
POMPEY:
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
POMPEY:
Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
POMPEY:
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
POMPEY:
Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
POMPEY:
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
POMPEY:
great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
POMPEY:
Pots, and, I think, forty more, all great doers in
POMPEY:
our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'
POMPEY:
Enter ABHORSON
ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
POMPEY:
Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
POMPEY:
Master Barnardine!
ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine!
BARNARDINE:
[Within]  A pox o' your throats! Who makes that
BARNARDINE:
noise there? What are you?
POMPEY:
Your friends, sir, the hangman. You must be so
POMPEY:
good, sir, to rise and be put to death.
BARNARDINE:
[Within]  Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.
ABHORSON:
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
POMPEY:
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
POMPEY:
executed, and sleep afterwards.
ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and fetch him out.
POMPEY:
He is coming, sir, he is coming, I hear his straw rustle.
ABHORSON:
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
POMPEY:
Very ready, sir.
POMPEY:
Enter BARNARDINE
BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?
ABHORSON:
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
ABHORSON:
prayers, for, look you, the warrant's come.
BARNARDINE:
You rogue, I have been drinking all night, I am not
BARNARDINE:
fitted for 't.
POMPEY:
O, the better, sir, for he that drinks all night,
POMPEY:
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
POMPEY:
sounder all the next day.
ABHORSON:
Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father: do
ABHORSON:
we jest now, think you?
ABHORSON:
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
DUKE VINCENTIO:
you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
DUKE VINCENTIO:
you and pray with you.
BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I	I have been drinking hard all night,
BARNARDINE:
and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
BARNARDINE:
shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
BARNARDINE:
consent to die this day, that's certain.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look forward on the journey you shall go.
BARNARDINE:
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
BARNARDINE:
persuasion.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But hear you.
BARNARDINE:
Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
BARNARDINE:
come to my ward, for thence will not I to-day.
BARNARDINE:
Exit
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
After him, fellows, bring him to the block.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Re-enter Provost
Provost:
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And to transport him in the mind he is
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were damnable.
Provost:
Here in the prison, father,
Provost:
There died this morning of a cruel fever
Provost:
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
Provost:
A man of Claudio's years, his beard and head
Provost:
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
Provost:
This reprobate till he were well inclined,
Provost:
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Provost:
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dispatch it presently, the hour draws on
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And sent according to command, whiles I
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.
Provost:
This shall be done, good father, presently.
Provost:
But Barnardine must die this afternoon
Provost:
And how shall we continue Claudio,
Provost:
To save me from the danger that might come
Provost:
If he were known alive?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let this be done.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To the under generation, you shall find
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your safety manifested.
Provost:
I am your free dependant.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exit Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To meet me at the consecrated fount
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A league below the city, and from thence,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We shall proceed with Angelo.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Re-enter Provost
Provost:
Here is the head, I'll carry it myself.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Convenient is it. Make a swift return,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For I would commune with you of such things
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That want no ear but yours.
Provost:
I'll make all speed.
Provost:
Exit
ISABELLA:
[Within]  Peace, ho, be here!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
DUKE VINCENTIO:
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
When it is least expected.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter ISABELLA
ISABELLA:
Ho, by your leave!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
ISABELLA:
The better, given me by so holy a man.
ISABELLA:
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath released him, Isabel, from the world
DUKE VINCENTIO:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.
ISABELLA:
Nay, but it is not so.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
In your close patience.
ISABELLA:
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall not be admitted to his sight.
ISABELLA:
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
ISABELLA:
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Forbear it therefore, give your cause to heaven.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Mark what I say, which you shall find
DUKE VINCENTIO:
By every syllable a faithful verity
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The duke comes home to-morrow, nay, dry your eyes,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
One of our convent, and his confessor,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
DUKE VINCENTIO:
In that good path that I would wish it go,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And general honour.
ISABELLA:
I am directed by you.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Say, by this token, I desire his company
DUKE VINCENTIO:
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I am combined by a sacred vow
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
DUKE VINCENTIO:
With a light heart, trust not my holy order,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
If I pervert your course. Who's here?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter LUCIO
LUCIO:
Good even. Friar, where's the provost?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not within, sir.
LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
LUCIO:
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
LUCIO:
to dine and sup with water and bran, I dare not for
LUCIO:
my head fill my belly, one fruitful meal would set
LUCIO:
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
LUCIO:
to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother
LUCIO:
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
LUCIO:
at home, he had lived.
LUCIO:
Exit ISABELLA
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
DUKE VINCENTIO:
reports, but the best is, he lives not in them.
LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do
LUCIO:
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
LUCIO:
Nay, tarry, I'll go along with thee
LUCIO:
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
DUKE VINCENTIO:
they be true, if not true, none were enough.
LUCIO:
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thing?
LUCIO:
Yes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it,
LUCIO:
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
LUCIO:
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end
LUCIO:
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
LUCIO:
it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr, I shall stick.
LUCIO:
Exeunt
LUCIO:
SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.
LUCIO:
Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS
ESCALUS:
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
ANGELO:
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
ANGELO:
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
ANGELO:
redeliver our authorities there
ESCALUS:
I guess not.
ANGELO:
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
ANGELO:
entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
ANGELO:
they should exhibit their petitions in the street?
ESCALUS:
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
ESCALUS:
complaints, and to deliver us from devices
ESCALUS:
hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
ESCALUS:
against us.
ANGELO:
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
ANGELO:
i' the morn, I'll call you at your house: give
ANGELO:
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
ANGELO:
him.
ESCALUS:
I shall, sir. Fare you well.
ANGELO:
Good night.
ANGELO:
Exit ESCALUS
ANGELO:
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
ANGELO:
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
ANGELO:
And by an eminent body that enforced
ANGELO:
The law against it! But that her tender shame
ANGELO:
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
ANGELO:
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no,
ANGELO:
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
ANGELO:
That no particular scandal once can touch
ANGELO:
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
ANGELO:
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
ANGELO:
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
ANGELO:
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
ANGELO:
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
ANGELO:
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
ANGELO:
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.
ANGELO:
Exit
ANGELO:
SCENE V. Fields without the town.
ANGELO:
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit, and FRIAR PETER
DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letters at fit time deliver me
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Giving letters
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And hold you ever to our special drift,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But send me Flavius first.
FRIAR PETER:
It shall be speeded well.
FRIAR PETER:
Exit
FRIAR PETER:
Enter VARRIUS
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank thee, Varrius, thou hast made good haste
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exeunt
DUKE VINCENTIO:
SCENE VI. Street near the city gate.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA
ISABELLA:
To speak so indirectly I am loath
ISABELLA:
I would say the truth, but to accuse him so,
ISABELLA:
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it,
ISABELLA:
He says, to veil full purpose.
MARIANA:
Be ruled by him.
ISABELLA:
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
ISABELLA:
He speak against me on the adverse side,
ISABELLA:
I should not think it strange, for 'tis a physic
ISABELLA:
That's bitter to sweet end.
MARIANA:
I would Friar Peter--
ISABELLA:
O, peace! the friar is come.
ISABELLA:
Enter FRIAR PETER
FRIAR PETER:
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
FRIAR PETER:
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
FRIAR PETER:
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded,
FRIAR PETER:
The generous and gravest citizens
FRIAR PETER:
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
FRIAR PETER:
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!
FRIAR PETER:
Exeunt
FRIAR PETER:
ACT V
FRIAR PETER:
SCENE I. The city gate.
FRIAR PETER:
MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their  stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords,  ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers, and Citizens, at several doors
DUKE VINCENTIO:
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
ESCALUS:
Happy return be to your royal grace!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have made inquiry of you, and we hear
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Forerunning more requital.
ANGELO:
You make my bonds still greater.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And let the subject see, to make them know
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You must walk by us on our other hand,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And good supporters are you.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward
FRIAR PETER:
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.
ISABELLA:
Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
ISABELLA:
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
ISABELLA:
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
ISABELLA:
By throwing it on any other object
ISABELLA:
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
ISABELLA:
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Relate your wrongs, in what? by whom? be brief.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Reveal yourself to him.
ISABELLA:
O worthy duke,
ISABELLA:
You bid me seek redemption of the devil
ISABELLA:
Hear me yourself, for that which I must speak
ISABELLA:
Must either punish me, not being believed,
ISABELLA:
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!
ANGELO:
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm
ANGELO:
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
ANGELO:
Cut off by course of justice,--
ISABELLA:
By course of justice!
ANGELO:
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
ISABELLA:
Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak
ISABELLA:
That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?
ISABELLA:
That Angelo's a murderer, is 't not strange?
ISABELLA:
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
ISABELLA:
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,
ISABELLA:
Is it not strange and strange?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, it is ten times strange.
ISABELLA:
It is not truer he is Angelo
ISABELLA:
Than this is all as true as it is strange
ISABELLA:
Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth
ISABELLA:
To the end of reckoning.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with her! Poor soul,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.
ISABELLA:
O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
ISABELLA:
There is another comfort than this world,
ISABELLA:
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
ISABELLA:
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
ISABELLA:
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
ISABELLA:
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
ISABELLA:
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
ISABELLA:
As Angelo, even so may Angelo,
ISABELLA:
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
ISABELLA:
Be an arch-villain, believe it, royal prince
ISABELLA:
If he be less, he's nothing, but he's more,
ISABELLA:
Had I more name for badness.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
By mine honesty,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As e'er I heard in madness.
ISABELLA:
O gracious duke,
ISABELLA:
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
ISABELLA:
For inequality, but let your reason serve
ISABELLA:
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
ISABELLA:
And hide the false seems true.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many that are not mad
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
ISABELLA:
I am the sister of one Claudio,
ISABELLA:
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
ISABELLA:
To lose his head, condemn'd by Angelo
ISABELLA:
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
ISABELLA:
Was sent to by my brother, one Lucio
ISABELLA:
As then the messenger,--
LUCIO:
That's I, an't like your grace
LUCIO:
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
LUCIO:
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
LUCIO:
For her poor brother's pardon.
ISABELLA:
That's he indeed.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You were not bid to speak.
LUCIO:
No, my good lord,
LUCIO:
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wish you now, then,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be perfect.
LUCIO:
I warrant your honour.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The warrants for yourself, take heed to't.
ISABELLA:
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
LUCIO:
Right.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It may be right, but you are i' the wrong
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To speak before your time. Proceed.
ISABELLA:
I went
ISABELLA:
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That's somewhat madly spoken.
ISABELLA:
Pardon it,
ISABELLA:
The phrase is to the matter.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Mended again. The matter, proceed.
ISABELLA:
In brief, to set the needless process by,
ISABELLA:
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
ISABELLA:
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
ISABELLA:
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
ISABELLA:
I now begin with grief and shame to utter
ISABELLA:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
ISABELLA:
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
ISABELLA:
Release my brother, and, after much debatement,
ISABELLA:
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
ISABELLA:
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
ISABELLA:
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
ISABELLA:
For my poor brother's head.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is most likely!
ISABELLA:
O, that it were as like as it is true!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
DUKE VINCENTIO:
In hateful practise. First, his integrity
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That with such vehemency he should pursue
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou camest here to complain.
ISABELLA:
And is this all?
ISABELLA:
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
ISABELLA:
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
ISABELLA:
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
ISABELLA:
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
ISABELLA:
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
DUKE VINCENTIO:
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
ISABELLA:
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
LUCIO:
My lord, I know him, 'tis a meddling friar,
LUCIO:
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
LUCIO:
For certain words he spake against your grace
LUCIO:
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And to set on this wretched woman here
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
LUCIO:
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
LUCIO:
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
LUCIO:
A very scurvy fellow.
FRIAR PETER:
Blessed be your royal grace!
FRIAR PETER:
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
FRIAR PETER:
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
FRIAR PETER:
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
FRIAR PETER:
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
FRIAR PETER:
As she from one ungot.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We did believe no less.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
FRIAR PETER:
I know him for a man divine and holy,
FRIAR PETER:
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
FRIAR PETER:
As he's reported by this gentleman,
FRIAR PETER:
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
FRIAR PETER:
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.
LUCIO:
My lord, most villanously, believe it.
FRIAR PETER:
Well, he in time may come to clear himself,
FRIAR PETER:
But at this instant he is sick my lord,
FRIAR PETER:
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
FRIAR PETER:
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
FRIAR PETER:
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
FRIAR PETER:
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
FRIAR PETER:
Is true and false, and what he with his oath
FRIAR PETER:
And all probation will make up full clear,
FRIAR PETER:
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
FRIAR PETER:
To justify this worthy nobleman,
FRIAR PETER:
So vulgarly and personally accused,
FRIAR PETER:
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
FRIAR PETER:
Till she herself confess it.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good friar, let's hear it.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
ISABELLA is carried off guarded, and MARIANA comes forward
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
In this I'll be impartial, be you judge
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
First, let her show her face, and after speak.
MARIANA:
Pardon, my lord, I will not show my face
MARIANA:
Until my husband bid me.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are you married?
MARIANA:
No, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are you a maid?
MARIANA:
No, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A widow, then?
MARIANA:
Neither, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
LUCIO:
My lord, she may be a punk, for many of them are
LUCIO:
neither maid, widow, nor wife.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To prattle for himself.
LUCIO:
Well, my lord.
MARIANA:
My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married,
MARIANA:
And I confess besides I am no maid
MARIANA:
I have known my husband, yet my husband
MARIANA:
Knows not that ever he knew me.
LUCIO:
He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
LUCIO:
Well, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
MARIANA:
Now I come to't my lord
MARIANA:
She that accuses him of fornication,
MARIANA:
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
MARIANA:
And charges him my lord, with such a time
MARIANA:
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
MARIANA:
With all the effect of love.
ANGELO:
Charges she more than me?
MARIANA:
Not that I know.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husband.
MARIANA:
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
MARIANA:
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
MARIANA:
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
ANGELO:
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
MARIANA:
My husband bids me, now I will unmask.
MARIANA:
Unveiling
MARIANA:
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
MARIANA:
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on,
MARIANA:
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
MARIANA:
Was fast belock'd in thine, this is the body
MARIANA:
That took away the match from Isabel,
MARIANA:
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
MARIANA:
In her imagined person.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Know you this woman?
LUCIO:
Carnally, she says.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, no more!
LUCIO:
Enough, my lord.
ANGELO:
My lord, I must confess I know this woman
ANGELO:
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
ANGELO:
Betwixt myself and her, which was broke off,
ANGELO:
Partly for that her promised proportions
ANGELO:
Came short of composition, but in chief
ANGELO:
For that her reputation was disvalued
ANGELO:
In levity: since which time of five years
ANGELO:
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
ANGELO:
Upon my faith and honour.
MARIANA:
Noble prince,
MARIANA:
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
MARIANA:
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
MARIANA:
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
MARIANA:
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
MARIANA:
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
MARIANA:
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
MARIANA:
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
MARIANA:
Or else for ever be confixed here,
MARIANA:
A marble monument!
ANGELO:
I did but smile till now
ANGELO:
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
ANGELO:
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
ANGELO:
These poor informal women are no more
ANGELO:
But instruments of some more mightier member
ANGELO:
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
ANGELO:
To find this practise out.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, with my heart
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sit with my cousin, lend him your kind pains
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
There is another friar that set them on,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let him be sent for.
FRIAR PETER:
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
FRIAR PETER:
Hath set the women on to this complaint
FRIAR PETER:
Your provost knows the place where he abides
FRIAR PETER:
And he may fetch him.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go do it instantly.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exit Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But stir not you till you have well determined
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Upon these slanderers.
ESCALUS:
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
ESCALUS:
Exit DUKE
ESCALUS:
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
ESCALUS:
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
LUCIO:
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
LUCIO:
but in his clothes, and one that hath spoke most
LUCIO:
villanous speeches of the duke.
ESCALUS:
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
ESCALUS:
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
ESCALUS:
notable fellow.
LUCIO:
As any in Vienna, on my word.
ESCALUS:
Call that same Isabel here once again, I would speak with her.
ESCALUS:
Exit an Attendant
ESCALUS:
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question, you
ESCALUS:
shall see how I'll handle her.
LUCIO:
Not better than he, by her own report.
ESCALUS:
Say you?
LUCIO:
Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
LUCIO:
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
LUCIO:
she'll be ashamed.
ESCALUS:
I will go darkly to work with her.
LUCIO:
That's the way, for women are light at midnight.
LUCIO:
Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA, and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit
ESCALUS:
Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
ESCALUS:
that you have said.
LUCIO:
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with
LUCIO:
the provost.
ESCALUS:
In very good time: speak not you to him till we
ESCALUS:
call upon you.
LUCIO:
Mum.
ESCALUS:
Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
ESCALUS:
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis false.
ESCALUS:
How! know you where you are?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
ESCALUS:
The duke's in us, and we will hear you speak
ESCALUS:
Look you speak justly.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which here you come to accuse.
LUCIO:
This is the rascal, this is he I spoke of.
ESCALUS:
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
ESCALUS:
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
ESCALUS:
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
ESCALUS:
And in the witness of his proper ear,
ESCALUS:
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
ESCALUS:
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
ESCALUS:
Take him hence, to the rack with him! We'll touse you
ESCALUS:
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
ESCALUS:
What 'unjust'!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be not so hot, the duke
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Till it o'er-run the stew, laws for all faults,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As much in mock as mark.
ESCALUS:
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
ANGELO:
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
ANGELO:
Is this the man that you did tell us of?
LUCIO:
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate
LUCIO:
do you know me?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
DUKE VINCENTIO:
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.
LUCIO:
O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most notedly, sir.
LUCIO:
Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
LUCIO:
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
DUKE VINCENTIO:
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him, and
DUKE VINCENTIO:
much more, much worse.
LUCIO:
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
LUCIO:
nose for thy speeches?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
ANGELO:
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
ANGELO:
treasonable abuses!
ESCALUS:
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
ESCALUS:
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
ESCALUS:
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
ESCALUS:
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
ESCALUS:
with the other confederate companion!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
[To Provost]  Stay, sir, stay awhile.
ANGELO:
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
LUCIO:
Come, sir, come, sir, come, sir, foh, sir! Why, you
LUCIO:
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
LUCIO:
you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
LUCIO:
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
LUCIO:
Will't not off?
LUCIO:
Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To LUCIO
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
LUCIO:
This may prove worse than hanging.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
[To ESCALUS]  What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We'll borrow place of him.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To ANGELO
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, by your leave.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And hold no longer out.
ANGELO:
O my dread lord,
ANGELO:
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
ANGELO:
To think I can be undiscernible,
ANGELO:
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
ANGELO:
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
ANGELO:
No longer session hold upon my shame,
ANGELO:
But let my trial be mine own confession
ANGELO:
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
ANGELO:
Is all the grace I beg.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Mariana.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
ANGELO:
I was, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you the office, friar, which consummate,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost
ESCALUS:
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
ESCALUS:
Than at the strangeness of it.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Isabel.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Advertising and holy to your business,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Attorney'd at your service.
ISABELLA:
O, give me pardon,
ISABELLA:
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
ISABELLA:
Your unknown sovereignty!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pardon'd, Isabel
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It was the swift celerity of his death,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That life is better life, past fearing death,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
So happy is your brother.
ISABELLA:
I do, my lord.
ISABELLA:
Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For this new-married man approaching here,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your well defended honour, you must pardon
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Being criminal, in double violation
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The very mercy of the law cries out
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We do condemn thee to the very block
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with him!
MARIANA:
O my most gracious lord,
MARIANA:
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thought your marriage fit, else imputation,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And choke your good to come, for his possessions,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Although by confiscation they are ours,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We do instate and widow you withal,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To buy you a better husband.
MARIANA:
O my dear lord,
MARIANA:
I crave no other, nor no better man.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never crave him, we are definitive.
MARIANA:
Gentle my liege,--
MARIANA:
Kneeling
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do but lose your labour.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with him to death!
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To LUCIO
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Now, sir, to you.
MARIANA:
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part,
MARIANA:
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
MARIANA:
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against all sense you do importune her
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And take her hence in horror.
MARIANA:
Isabel,
MARIANA:
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me,
MARIANA:
Hold up your hands, say nothing, I'll speak all.
MARIANA:
They say, best men are moulded out of faults,
MARIANA:
And, for the most, become much more the better
MARIANA:
For being a little bad: so may my husband.
MARIANA:
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He dies for Claudio's death.
ISABELLA:
Most bounteous sir,
ISABELLA:
Kneeling
ISABELLA:
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
ISABELLA:
As if my brother lived: I partly think
ISABELLA:
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
ISABELLA:
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
ISABELLA:
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
ISABELLA:
In that he did the thing for which he died
ISABELLA:
For Angelo,
ISABELLA:
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
ISABELLA:
And must be buried but as an intent
ISABELLA:
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects,
ISABELLA:
Intents but merely thoughts.
MARIANA:
Merely, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable, stand up, I say.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I have bethought me of another fault.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
DUKE VINCENTIO:
At an unusual hour?
Provost:
It was commanded so.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Had you a special warrant for the deed?
Provost:
No, my good lord, it was by private message.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which I do discharge you of your office
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Give up your keys.
Provost:
Pardon me, noble lord
Provost:
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not,
Provost:
Yet did repent me, after more advice,
Provost:
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
Provost:
That should by private order else have died,
Provost:
I have reserved alive.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's he?
Provost:
His name is Barnardine.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go fetch him hither, let me look upon him.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exit Provost
ESCALUS:
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
ESCALUS:
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
ESCALUS:
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
ESCALUS:
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
ANGELO:
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure
ANGELO:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
ANGELO:
That I crave death more willingly than mercy,
ANGELO:
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
ANGELO:
Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIET
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which is that Barnardine?
Provost:
This, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
There was a friar told me of this man.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That apprehends no further than this world,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd
DUKE VINCENTIO:
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
DUKE VINCENTIO:
For better times to come. Friar, advise him,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?
Provost:
This is another prisoner that I saved.
Provost:
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head,
Provost:
As like almost to Claudio as himself.
Provost:
Unmuffles CLAUDIO
DUKE VINCENTIO:
[To ISABELLA]  If he be like your brother, for his sake
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Is he pardon'd, and, for your lovely sake,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look that you love your wife, her worth worth yours.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I find an apt remission in myself,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
To LUCIO
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wherein have I so deserved of you,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That you extol me thus?
LUCIO:
'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
LUCIO:
trick. If you will hang me for it, you may, but I
LUCIO:
had rather it would please you I might be whipt.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let him be whipt and hang'd.
LUCIO:
I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
LUCIO:
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke
LUCIO:
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thy slanders I forgive, and therewithal
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And see our pleasure herein executed.
LUCIO:
Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
LUCIO:
whipping, and hanging.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Slandering a prince deserves it.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exit Officers with LUCIO
DUKE VINCENTIO:
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness
DUKE VINCENTIO:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's
DUKE VINCENTIO:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I have a motion much imports your good,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
So, bring us to our palace, where we'll show
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Exeunt
