ACT I
SCENE I. London. The palace.
Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others
KING HENRY IV:
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
KING HENRY IV:
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
KING HENRY IV:
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
KING HENRY IV:
To be commenced in strands afar remote.
KING HENRY IV:
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
KING HENRY IV:
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood,
KING HENRY IV:
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
KING HENRY IV:
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
KING HENRY IV:
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
KING HENRY IV:
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
KING HENRY IV:
All of one nature, of one substance bred,
KING HENRY IV:
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
KING HENRY IV:
And furious close of civil butchery
KING HENRY IV:
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
KING HENRY IV:
March all one way and be no more opposed
KING HENRY IV:
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies
KING HENRY IV:
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
KING HENRY IV:
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
KING HENRY IV:
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
KING HENRY IV:
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
KING HENRY IV:
We are impressed and engaged to fight,
KING HENRY IV:
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,
KING HENRY IV:
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
KING HENRY IV:
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
KING HENRY IV:
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
KING HENRY IV:
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
KING HENRY IV:
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
KING HENRY IV:
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
KING HENRY IV:
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go
KING HENRY IV:
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
KING HENRY IV:
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
KING HENRY IV:
What yesternight our council did decree
KING HENRY IV:
In forwarding this dear expedience.
WESTMORELAND:
My liege, this haste was hot in question,
WESTMORELAND:
And many limits of the charge set down
WESTMORELAND:
But yesternight: when all athwart there came
WESTMORELAND:
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,
WESTMORELAND:
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
WESTMORELAND:
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
WESTMORELAND:
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
WESTMORELAND:
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
WESTMORELAND:
A thousand of his people butchered,
WESTMORELAND:
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
WESTMORELAND:
Such beastly shameless transformation,
WESTMORELAND:
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
WESTMORELAND:
Without much shame retold or spoken of.
KING HENRY IV:
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
KING HENRY IV:
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
WESTMORELAND:
This match'd with other did, my gracious lord,
WESTMORELAND:
For more uneven and unwelcome news
WESTMORELAND:
Came from the north and thus it did import
WESTMORELAND:
On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
WESTMORELAND:
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
WESTMORELAND:
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
WESTMORELAND:
At Holmedon met,
WESTMORELAND:
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
WESTMORELAND:
As by discharge of their artillery,
WESTMORELAND:
And shape of likelihood, the news was told,
WESTMORELAND:
For he that brought them, in the very heat
WESTMORELAND:
And pride of their contention did take horse,
WESTMORELAND:
Uncertain of the issue any way.
KING HENRY IV:
Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
KING HENRY IV:
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
KING HENRY IV:
Stain'd with the variation of each soil
KING HENRY IV:
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,
KING HENRY IV:
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
KING HENRY IV:
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited
KING HENRY IV:
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
KING HENRY IV:
Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
KING HENRY IV:
On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
KING HENRY IV:
Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
KING HENRY IV:
To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,
KING HENRY IV:
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith
KING HENRY IV:
And is not this an honourable spoil?
KING HENRY IV:
A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
WESTMORELAND:
In faith,
WESTMORELAND:
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
KING HENRY IV:
Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
KING HENRY IV:
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
KING HENRY IV:
Should be the father to so blest a son,
KING HENRY IV:
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
KING HENRY IV:
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,
KING HENRY IV:
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride
KING HENRY IV:
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
KING HENRY IV:
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
KING HENRY IV:
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
KING HENRY IV:
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
KING HENRY IV:
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
KING HENRY IV:
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
KING HENRY IV:
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
KING HENRY IV:
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
KING HENRY IV:
Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
KING HENRY IV:
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
KING HENRY IV:
To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,
KING HENRY IV:
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
WESTMORELAND:
This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,
WESTMORELAND:
Malevolent to you in all aspects,
WESTMORELAND:
Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
WESTMORELAND:
The crest of youth against your dignity.
KING HENRY IV:
But I have sent for him to answer this,
KING HENRY IV:
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
KING HENRY IV:
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
KING HENRY IV:
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
KING HENRY IV:
Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords
KING HENRY IV:
But come yourself with speed to us again,
KING HENRY IV:
For more is to be said and to be done
KING HENRY IV:
Than out of anger can be uttered.
WESTMORELAND:
I will, my liege.
WESTMORELAND:
Exeunt
WESTMORELAND:
SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.
WESTMORELAND:
Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF:
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
PRINCE HENRY:
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
PRINCE HENRY:
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
PRINCE HENRY:
benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
PRINCE HENRY:
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
PRINCE HENRY:
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
PRINCE HENRY:
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
PRINCE HENRY:
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
PRINCE HENRY:
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
PRINCE HENRY:
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
PRINCE HENRY:
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
PRINCE HENRY:
the time of the day.
FALSTAFF:
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take
FALSTAFF:
purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
FALSTAFF:
by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
FALSTAFF:
I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
FALSTAFF:
save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
FALSTAFF:
thou wilt have none,--
PRINCE HENRY:
What, none?
FALSTAFF:
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
FALSTAFF:
prologue to an egg and butter.
PRINCE HENRY:
Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
FALSTAFF:
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
FALSTAFF:
us that are squires of the night's body be called
FALSTAFF:
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
FALSTAFF:
foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
FALSTAFF:
moon, and let men say we be men of good government,
FALSTAFF:
being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
FALSTAFF:
chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
PRINCE HENRY:
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the
PRINCE HENRY:
fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
PRINCE HENRY:
flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
PRINCE HENRY:
by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
PRINCE HENRY:
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
PRINCE HENRY:
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with
PRINCE HENRY:
swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in,'
PRINCE HENRY:
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
PRINCE HENRY:
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
FALSTAFF:
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
PRINCE HENRY:
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
PRINCE HENRY:
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
FALSTAFF:
How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
FALSTAFF:
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
FALSTAFF:
buff jerkin?
PRINCE HENRY:
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
FALSTAFF:
Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
FALSTAFF:
time and oft.
PRINCE HENRY:
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
FALSTAFF:
No, I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
PRINCE HENRY:
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch,
PRINCE HENRY:
and where it would not, I have used my credit.
FALSTAFF:
Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
FALSTAFF:
that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
FALSTAFF:
wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
FALSTAFF:
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
FALSTAFF:
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
FALSTAFF:
not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
PRINCE HENRY:
No, thou shalt.
FALSTAFF:
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
PRINCE HENRY:
Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
PRINCE HENRY:
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
FALSTAFF:
Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my
FALSTAFF:
humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
FALSTAFF:
you.
PRINCE HENRY:
For obtaining of suits?
FALSTAFF:
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
FALSTAFF:
hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
FALSTAFF:
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
PRINCE HENRY:
Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
FALSTAFF:
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
PRINCE HENRY:
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
PRINCE HENRY:
Moor-ditch?
FALSTAFF:
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
FALSTAFF:
the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
FALSTAFF:
prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
FALSTAFF:
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
FALSTAFF:
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
FALSTAFF:
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
FALSTAFF:
street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet
FALSTAFF:
he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and
FALSTAFF:
yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
PRINCE HENRY:
Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the
PRINCE HENRY:
streets, and no man regards it.
FALSTAFF:
O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
FALSTAFF:
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
FALSTAFF:
me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
FALSTAFF:
thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man
FALSTAFF:
should speak truly, little better than one of the
FALSTAFF:
wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
FALSTAFF:
it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain
FALSTAFF:
I'll be damned for never a king's son in
FALSTAFF:
Christendom.
PRINCE HENRY:
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
FALSTAFF:
'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I'll make one, an I
FALSTAFF:
do not, call me villain and baffle me.
PRINCE HENRY:
I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying
PRINCE HENRY:
to purse-taking.
FALSTAFF:
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal, 'tis no sin for a
FALSTAFF:
man to labour in his vocation.
FALSTAFF:
Enter POINS
FALSTAFF:
Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
FALSTAFF:
match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
FALSTAFF:
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
FALSTAFF:
most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
FALSTAFF:
a true man.
PRINCE HENRY:
Good morrow, Ned.
POINS:
Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
POINS:
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
POINS:
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
POINS:
soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
POINS:
and a cold capon's leg?
PRINCE HENRY:
Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
PRINCE HENRY:
his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of
PRINCE HENRY:
proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
POINS:
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
PRINCE HENRY:
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
POINS:
But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
POINS:
o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
POINS:
to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
POINS:
riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
POINS:
for you all, you have horses for yourselves
POINS:
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
POINS:
supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
POINS:
as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
POINS:
your purses full of crowns, if you will not, tarry
POINS:
at home and be hanged.
FALSTAFF:
Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not,
FALSTAFF:
I'll hang you for going.
POINS:
You will, chops?
FALSTAFF:
Hal, wilt thou make one?
PRINCE HENRY:
Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
FALSTAFF:
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
FALSTAFF:
fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
FALSTAFF:
royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
PRINCE HENRY:
Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
FALSTAFF:
Why, that's well said.
PRINCE HENRY:
Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
PRINCE HENRY:
I care not.
POINS:
Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone
POINS:
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
POINS:
that he shall go.
FALSTAFF:
Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
FALSTAFF:
the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
FALSTAFF:
move and what he hears may be believed, that the
FALSTAFF:
true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
FALSTAFF:
thief, for the poor abuses of the time want
FALSTAFF:
countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
PRINCE HENRY:
Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit Falstaff
POINS:
Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
POINS:
to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
POINS:
manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
POINS:
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid
POINS:
yourself and I will not be there, and when they
POINS:
have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
POINS:
this head off from my shoulders.
PRINCE HENRY:
How shall we part with them in setting forth?
POINS:
Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
POINS:
appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
POINS:
our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
POINS:
upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have
POINS:
no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
PRINCE HENRY:
Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
PRINCE HENRY:
horses, by our habits and by every other
PRINCE HENRY:
appointment, to be ourselves.
POINS:
Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
POINS:
in the wood, our vizards we will change after we
POINS:
leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
POINS:
for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
PRINCE HENRY:
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
POINS:
Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
POINS:
true-bred cowards as ever turned back, and for the
POINS:
third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
POINS:
forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
POINS:
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
POINS:
tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
POINS:
least, he fought with, what wards, what blows, what
POINS:
extremities he endured, and in the reproof of this
POINS:
lies the jest.
PRINCE HENRY:
Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
PRINCE HENRY:
necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap,
PRINCE HENRY:
there I'll sup. Farewell.
POINS:
Farewell, my lord.
POINS:
Exit Poins
PRINCE HENRY:
I know you all, and will awhile uphold
PRINCE HENRY:
The unyoked humour of your idleness
PRINCE HENRY:
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
PRINCE HENRY:
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
PRINCE HENRY:
To smother up his beauty from the world,
PRINCE HENRY:
That, when he please again to be himself,
PRINCE HENRY:
Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
PRINCE HENRY:
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
PRINCE HENRY:
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
PRINCE HENRY:
If all the year were playing holidays,
PRINCE HENRY:
To sport would be as tedious as to work,
PRINCE HENRY:
But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
PRINCE HENRY:
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
PRINCE HENRY:
So, when this loose behavior I throw off
PRINCE HENRY:
And pay the debt I never promised,
PRINCE HENRY:
By how much better than my word I am,
PRINCE HENRY:
By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,
PRINCE HENRY:
And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
PRINCE HENRY:
My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
PRINCE HENRY:
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
PRINCE HENRY:
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
PRINCE HENRY:
I'll so offend, to make offence a skill,
PRINCE HENRY:
Redeeming time when men think least I will.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit
PRINCE HENRY:
SCENE III. London. The palace.
PRINCE HENRY:
Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others
KING HENRY IV:
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
KING HENRY IV:
Unapt to stir at these indignities,
KING HENRY IV:
And you have found me, for accordingly
KING HENRY IV:
You tread upon my patience: but be sure
KING HENRY IV:
I will from henceforth rather be myself,
KING HENRY IV:
Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,
KING HENRY IV:
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
KING HENRY IV:
And therefore lost that title of respect
KING HENRY IV:
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The scourge of greatness to be used on it,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And that same greatness too which our own hands
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Have holp to make so portly.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord.--
KING HENRY IV:
Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see
KING HENRY IV:
Danger and disobedience in thine eye
KING HENRY IV:
O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
KING HENRY IV:
And majesty might never yet endure
KING HENRY IV:
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
KING HENRY IV:
You have good leave to leave us: when we need
KING HENRY IV:
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
KING HENRY IV:
Exit Worcester
KING HENRY IV:
You were about to speak.
KING HENRY IV:
To North
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yea, my good lord.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
NORTHUMBERLAND:
As is deliver'd to your majesty
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Either envy, therefore, or misprison
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
HOTSPUR:
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
HOTSPUR:
But I remember, when the fight was done,
HOTSPUR:
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
HOTSPUR:
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
HOTSPUR:
Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
HOTSPUR:
Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap'd
HOTSPUR:
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home,
HOTSPUR:
He was perfumed like a milliner,
HOTSPUR:
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
HOTSPUR:
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
HOTSPUR:
He gave his nose and took't away again,
HOTSPUR:
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
HOTSPUR:
Took it in snuff, and still he smiled and talk'd,
HOTSPUR:
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
HOTSPUR:
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
HOTSPUR:
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
HOTSPUR:
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
HOTSPUR:
With many holiday and lady terms
HOTSPUR:
He question'd me, amongst the rest, demanded
HOTSPUR:
My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
HOTSPUR:
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
HOTSPUR:
To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
HOTSPUR:
Out of my grief and my impatience,
HOTSPUR:
Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
HOTSPUR:
He should or he should not, for he made me mad
HOTSPUR:
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
HOTSPUR:
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
HOTSPUR:
Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
HOTSPUR:
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
HOTSPUR:
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise,
HOTSPUR:
And that it was great pity, so it was,
HOTSPUR:
This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
HOTSPUR:
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
HOTSPUR:
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
HOTSPUR:
So cowardly, and but for these vile guns,
HOTSPUR:
He would himself have been a soldier.
HOTSPUR:
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
HOTSPUR:
I answer'd indirectly, as I said,
HOTSPUR:
And I beseech you, let not his report
HOTSPUR:
Come current for an accusation
HOTSPUR:
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
To such a person and in such a place,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
At such a time, with all the rest retold,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
May reasonably die and never rise
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
To do him wrong or any way impeach
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
What then he said, so he unsay it now.
KING HENRY IV:
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
KING HENRY IV:
But with proviso and exception,
KING HENRY IV:
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
KING HENRY IV:
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,
KING HENRY IV:
Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
KING HENRY IV:
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
KING HENRY IV:
Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
KING HENRY IV:
Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
KING HENRY IV:
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
KING HENRY IV:
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
KING HENRY IV:
Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
KING HENRY IV:
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
KING HENRY IV:
No, on the barren mountains let him starve,
KING HENRY IV:
For I shall never hold that man my friend
KING HENRY IV:
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
KING HENRY IV:
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
HOTSPUR:
Revolted Mortimer!
HOTSPUR:
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
HOTSPUR:
But by the chance of war, to prove that true
HOTSPUR:
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
HOTSPUR:
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
HOTSPUR:
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
HOTSPUR:
In single opposition, hand to hand,
HOTSPUR:
He did confound the best part of an hour
HOTSPUR:
In changing hardiment with great Glendower
HOTSPUR:
Three times they breathed and three times did
HOTSPUR:
they drink,
HOTSPUR:
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,
HOTSPUR:
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
HOTSPUR:
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
HOTSPUR:
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
HOTSPUR:
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
HOTSPUR:
Never did base and rotten policy
HOTSPUR:
Colour her working with such deadly wounds,
HOTSPUR:
Nor could the noble Mortimer
HOTSPUR:
Receive so many, and all willingly
HOTSPUR:
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
KING HENRY IV:
Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him,
KING HENRY IV:
He never did encounter with Glendower
KING HENRY IV:
I tell thee,
KING HENRY IV:
He durst as well have met the devil alone
KING HENRY IV:
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
KING HENRY IV:
Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
KING HENRY IV:
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer
KING HENRY IV:
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
KING HENRY IV:
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
KING HENRY IV:
As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
KING HENRY IV:
We licence your departure with your son.
KING HENRY IV:
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
KING HENRY IV:
Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train
HOTSPUR:
An if the devil come and roar for them,
HOTSPUR:
I will not send them: I will after straight
HOTSPUR:
And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,
HOTSPUR:
Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here comes your uncle.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Re-enter WORCESTER
HOTSPUR:
Speak of Mortimer!
HOTSPUR:
'Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul
HOTSPUR:
Want mercy, if I do not join with him
HOTSPUR:
Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
HOTSPUR:
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
HOTSPUR:
But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
HOTSPUR:
As high in the air as this unthankful king,
HOTSPUR:
As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
HOTSPUR:
He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners,
HOTSPUR:
And when I urged the ransom once again
HOTSPUR:
Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
HOTSPUR:
And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
HOTSPUR:
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
EARL OF WORCESTER:
By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
NORTHUMBERLAND:
He was, I heard the proclamation
NORTHUMBERLAND:
And then it was when the unhappy king,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Upon his Irish expedition,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
From whence he intercepted did return
NORTHUMBERLAND:
To be deposed and shortly murdered.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
HOTSPUR:
But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then
HOTSPUR:
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
HOTSPUR:
Heir to the crown?
NORTHUMBERLAND:
He did, myself did hear it.
HOTSPUR:
Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
HOTSPUR:
That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
HOTSPUR:
But shall it be that you, that set the crown
HOTSPUR:
Upon the head of this forgetful man
HOTSPUR:
And for his sake wear the detested blot
HOTSPUR:
Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
HOTSPUR:
That you a world of curses undergo,
HOTSPUR:
Being the agents, or base second means,
HOTSPUR:
The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
HOTSPUR:
O, pardon me that I descend so low,
HOTSPUR:
To show the line and the predicament
HOTSPUR:
Wherein you range under this subtle king,
HOTSPUR:
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
HOTSPUR:
Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
HOTSPUR:
That men of your nobility and power
HOTSPUR:
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
HOTSPUR:
As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
HOTSPUR:
To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
HOTSPUR:
An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
HOTSPUR:
And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
HOTSPUR:
That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
HOTSPUR:
By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
HOTSPUR:
No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem
HOTSPUR:
Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
HOTSPUR:
Into the good thoughts of the world again,
HOTSPUR:
Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
HOTSPUR:
Of this proud king, who studies day and night
HOTSPUR:
To answer all the debt he owes to you
HOTSPUR:
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths
HOTSPUR:
Therefore, I say--
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Peace, cousin, say no more
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And now I will unclasp a secret book,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And to your quick-conceiving discontents
EARL OF WORCESTER:
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
EARL OF WORCESTER:
As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
EARL OF WORCESTER:
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
HOTSPUR:
If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim
HOTSPUR:
Send danger from the east unto the west,
HOTSPUR:
So honour cross it from the north to south,
HOTSPUR:
And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
HOTSPUR:
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Imagination of some great exploit
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
HOTSPUR:
By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
HOTSPUR:
To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
HOTSPUR:
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
HOTSPUR:
Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
HOTSPUR:
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,
HOTSPUR:
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
HOTSPUR:
Without corrival, all her dignities
HOTSPUR:
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
EARL OF WORCESTER:
He apprehends a world of figures here,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
But not the form of what he should attend.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
HOTSPUR:
I cry you mercy.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Those same noble Scots
EARL OF WORCESTER:
That are your prisoners,--
HOTSPUR:
I'll keep them all,
HOTSPUR:
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them,
HOTSPUR:
No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not
HOTSPUR:
I'll keep them, by this hand.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
You start away
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And lend no ear unto my purposes.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Those prisoners you shall keep.
HOTSPUR:
Nay, I will, that's flat
HOTSPUR:
He said he would not ransom Mortimer,
HOTSPUR:
Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer,
HOTSPUR:
But I will find him when he lies asleep,
HOTSPUR:
And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
HOTSPUR:
Nay,
HOTSPUR:
I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
HOTSPUR:
Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
HOTSPUR:
To keep his anger still in motion.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Hear you, cousin, a word.
HOTSPUR:
All studies here I solemnly defy,
HOTSPUR:
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke
HOTSPUR:
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
HOTSPUR:
But that I think his father loves him not
HOTSPUR:
And would be glad he met with some mischance,
HOTSPUR:
I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
EARL OF WORCESTER:
When you are better temper'd to attend.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
HOTSPUR:
Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
HOTSPUR:
Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
HOTSPUR:
Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
HOTSPUR:
In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
HOTSPUR:
A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire,
HOTSPUR:
'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
HOTSPUR:
His uncle York, where I first bow'd my knee
HOTSPUR:
Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
HOTSPUR:
'Sblood!--
HOTSPUR:
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
At Berkley castle.
HOTSPUR:
You say true
HOTSPUR:
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
HOTSPUR:
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
HOTSPUR:
Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
HOTSPUR:
And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin,'
HOTSPUR:
O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
HOTSPUR:
Good uncle, tell your tale, I have done.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Nay, if you have not, to it again,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
We will stay your leisure.
HOTSPUR:
I have done, i' faith.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And make the Douglas' son your only mean
EARL OF WORCESTER:
For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Which I shall send you written, be assured,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
To Northumberland
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Shall secretly into the bosom creep
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The archbishop.
HOTSPUR:
Of York, is it not?
EARL OF WORCESTER:
True, who bears hard
EARL OF WORCESTER:
His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
I speak not this in estimation,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
As what I think might be, but what I know
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And only stays but to behold the face
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
HOTSPUR:
I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.
HOTSPUR:
Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot,
HOTSPUR:
And then the power of Scotland and of York,
HOTSPUR:
To join with Mortimer, ha?
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And so they shall.
HOTSPUR:
In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
To save our heads by raising of a head,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The king will always think him in our debt,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Till he hath found a time to pay us home
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And see already how he doth begin
EARL OF WORCESTER:
To make us strangers to his looks of love.
HOTSPUR:
He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Than I by letters shall direct your course.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.
HOTSPUR:
Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short
HOTSPUR:
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!
HOTSPUR:
Exeunt
HOTSPUR:
ACT II
HOTSPUR:
SCENE I. Rochester. An inn yard.
HOTSPUR:
Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand
First Carrier:
Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be
First Carrier:
hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and
First Carrier:
yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!
Ostler:
[Within]   Anon, anon.
First Carrier:
I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks
First Carrier:
in the point, poor jade, is wrung in the withers out
First Carrier:
of all cess.
First Carrier:
Enter another Carrier
Second Carrier:
Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that
Second Carrier:
is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
Second Carrier:
house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
First Carrier:
Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats
First Carrier:
rose, it was the death of him.
Second Carrier:
I think this be the most villanous house in all
Second Carrier:
London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
First Carrier:
Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king
First Carrier:
christen could be better bit than I have been since
First Carrier:
the first cock.
Second Carrier:
Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we
Second Carrier:
leak in your chimney, and your chamber-lie breeds
Second Carrier:
fleas like a loach.
First Carrier:
What, ostler! come away and be hanged!
Second Carrier:
I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,
Second Carrier:
to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
First Carrier:
God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
First Carrier:
starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
First Carrier:
never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
First Carrier:
'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate
First Carrier:
on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!
First Carrier:
hast thou no faith in thee?
First Carrier:
Enter GADSHILL
GADSHILL:
Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?
First Carrier:
I think it be two o'clock.
GADSHILL:
I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
GADSHILL:
in the stable.
First Carrier:
Nay, by God, soft, I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.
GADSHILL:
I pray thee, lend me thine.
Second Carrier:
Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
Second Carrier:
he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.
GADSHILL:
Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?
Second Carrier:
Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant
Second Carrier:
thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
Second Carrier:
gentleman: they will along with company, for they
Second Carrier:
have great charge.
Second Carrier:
Exeunt carriers
GADSHILL:
What, ho! chamberlain!
Chamberlain:
[Within]  At hand, quoth pick-purse.
GADSHILL:
That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the
GADSHILL:
chamberlain, for thou variest no more from picking
GADSHILL:
of purses than giving direction doth from labouring,
GADSHILL:
thou layest the plot how.
GADSHILL:
Enter Chamberlain
Chamberlain:
Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
Chamberlain:
I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
Chamberlain:
wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
Chamberlain:
him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
Chamberlain:
company last night at supper, a kind of auditor, one
Chamberlain:
that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.
Chamberlain:
They are up already, and call for eggs and butter,
Chamberlain:
they will away presently.
GADSHILL:
Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
GADSHILL:
clerks, I'll give thee this neck.
Chamberlain:
No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the
Chamberlain:
hangman, for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
Chamberlain:
as truly as a man of falsehood may.
GADSHILL:
What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,
GADSHILL:
I'll make a fat pair of gallows, for if I hang, old
GADSHILL:
Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no
GADSHILL:
starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
GADSHILL:
dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
GADSHILL:
content to do the profession some grace, that would,
GADSHILL:
if matters should be looked into, for their own
GADSHILL:
credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no
GADSHILL:
foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
GADSHILL:
none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms,
GADSHILL:
but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
GADSHILL:
great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
GADSHILL:
strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
GADSHILL:
drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
GADSHILL:
I lie, for they pray continually to their saint, the
GADSHILL:
commonwealth, or rather, not pray to her, but prey
GADSHILL:
on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
GADSHILL:
her their boots.
Chamberlain:
What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
Chamberlain:
out water in foul way?
GADSHILL:
She will, she will, justice hath liquored her. We
GADSHILL:
steal as in a castle, cocksure, we have the receipt
GADSHILL:
of fern-seed, we walk invisible.
Chamberlain:
Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
Chamberlain:
the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
GADSHILL:
Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
GADSHILL:
purchase, as I am a true man.
Chamberlain:
Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
GADSHILL:
Go to, 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the
GADSHILL:
ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,
GADSHILL:
you muddy knave.
GADSHILL:
Exeunt
GADSHILL:
SCENE II. The highway, near Gadshill.
GADSHILL:
Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
POINS:
Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's
POINS:
horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.
PRINCE HENRY:
Stand close.
PRINCE HENRY:
Enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF:
Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!
PRINCE HENRY:
Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost
PRINCE HENRY:
thou keep!
FALSTAFF:
Where's Poins, Hal?
PRINCE HENRY:
He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
FALSTAFF:
I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
FALSTAFF:
rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
FALSTAFF:
not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
FALSTAFF:
further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
FALSTAFF:
not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
FALSTAFF:
'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
FALSTAFF:
forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
FALSTAFF:
twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
FALSTAFF:
rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
FALSTAFF:
medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged, it
FALSTAFF:
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
FALSTAFF:
Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
FALSTAFF:
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
FALSTAFF:
not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
FALSTAFF:
leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
FALSTAFF:
ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
FALSTAFF:
ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me,
FALSTAFF:
and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough
FALSTAFF:
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
FALSTAFF:
They whistle
FALSTAFF:
Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you
FALSTAFF:
rogues, give me my horse, and be hanged!
PRINCE HENRY:
Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down, lay thine ear close
PRINCE HENRY:
to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
PRINCE HENRY:
of travellers.
FALSTAFF:
Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?
FALSTAFF:
'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
FALSTAFF:
again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
FALSTAFF:
What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?
PRINCE HENRY:
Thou liest, thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.
FALSTAFF:
I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,
FALSTAFF:
good king's son.
PRINCE HENRY:
Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?
FALSTAFF:
Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
FALSTAFF:
garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I
FALSTAFF:
have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy
FALSTAFF:
tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
FALSTAFF:
is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.
FALSTAFF:
Enter GADSHILL, BARDOLPH and PETO
GADSHILL:
Stand.
FALSTAFF:
So I do, against my will.
POINS:
O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,
POINS:
what news?
BARDOLPH:
Case ye, case ye, on with your vizards: there 's
BARDOLPH:
money of the king's coming down the hill, 'tis going
BARDOLPH:
to the king's exchequer.
FALSTAFF:
You lie, ye rogue, 'tis going to the king's tavern.
GADSHILL:
There's enough to make us all.
FALSTAFF:
To be hanged.
PRINCE HENRY:
Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane,
PRINCE HENRY:
Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape
PRINCE HENRY:
from your encounter, then they light on us.
PETO:
How many be there of them?
GADSHILL:
Some eight or ten.
FALSTAFF:
'Zounds, will they not rob us?
PRINCE HENRY:
What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?
FALSTAFF:
Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather,
FALSTAFF:
but yet no coward, Hal.
PRINCE HENRY:
Well, we leave that to the proof.
POINS:
Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge
POINS:
when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.
POINS:
Farewell, and stand fast.
FALSTAFF:
Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.
PRINCE HENRY:
Ned, where are our disguises?
POINS:
Here, hard by: stand close.
POINS:
Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS
FALSTAFF:
Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I
FALSTAFF:
every man to his business.
FALSTAFF:
Enter the Travellers
First Traveller:
Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down
First Traveller:
the hill, we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs.
Thieves:
Stand!
Travellers:
Jesus bless us!
FALSTAFF:
Strike, down with them, cut the villains' throats
FALSTAFF:
ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
FALSTAFF:
hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.
Travellers:
O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!
FALSTAFF:
Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye
FALSTAFF:
fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,
FALSTAFF:
bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.
FALSTAFF:
You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.
FALSTAFF:
Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt
FALSTAFF:
Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
PRINCE HENRY:
The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
PRINCE HENRY:
and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it
PRINCE HENRY:
would be argument for a week, laughter for a month
PRINCE HENRY:
and a good jest for ever.
POINS:
Stand close, I hear them coming.
POINS:
Enter the Thieves again
FALSTAFF:
Come, my masters, let us share, and then to  horse
FALSTAFF:
before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
FALSTAFF:
arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
FALSTAFF:
no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.
PRINCE HENRY:
Your money!
POINS:
Villains!
POINS:
As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon  them, they all run away, and Falstaff, after a blow or two, runs away too, leaving the booty behind them
PRINCE HENRY:
Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse
PRINCE HENRY:
The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
PRINCE HENRY:
So strongly that they dare not meet each other,
PRINCE HENRY:
Each takes his fellow for an officer.
PRINCE HENRY:
Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,
PRINCE HENRY:
And lards the lean earth as he walks along
PRINCE HENRY:
Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.
POINS:
How the rogue roar'd!
POINS:
Exeunt
POINS:
SCENE III. Warkworth castle
POINS:
Enter HOTSPUR, solus, reading a letter
HOTSPUR:
'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well
HOTSPUR:
contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear
HOTSPUR:
your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,
HOTSPUR:
then? In respect of the love he bears our house
HOTSPUR:
he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than
HOTSPUR:
he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The
HOTSPUR:
purpose you undertake is dangerous,'--why, that's
HOTSPUR:
certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to
HOTSPUR:
drink, but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this
HOTSPUR:
nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The
HOTSPUR:
purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friends you
HOTSPUR:
have named uncertain, the time itself unsorted, and
HOTSPUR:
your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
HOTSPUR:
great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say
HOTSPUR:
unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and
HOTSPUR:
you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,
HOTSPUR:
our plot is a good plot as ever was laid, our
HOTSPUR:
friends true and constant: a good plot, good
HOTSPUR:
friends, and full of expectation, an excellent plot,
HOTSPUR:
very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is
HOTSPUR:
this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the
HOTSPUR:
general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by
HOTSPUR:
this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.
HOTSPUR:
Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord
HOTSPUR:
Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?
HOTSPUR:
is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
HOTSPUR:
their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the
HOTSPUR:
next month? and are they not some of them set
HOTSPUR:
forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
HOTSPUR:
infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
HOTSPUR:
of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
HOTSPUR:
open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
HOTSPUR:
and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
HOTSPUR:
skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!
HOTSPUR:
let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
HOTSPUR:
forward to-night.
HOTSPUR:
Enter LADY PERCY
HOTSPUR:
How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.
LADY PERCY:
O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
LADY PERCY:
For what offence have I this fortnight been
LADY PERCY:
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
LADY PERCY:
Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
LADY PERCY:
Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?
LADY PERCY:
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
LADY PERCY:
And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
LADY PERCY:
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks,
LADY PERCY:
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
LADY PERCY:
To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
LADY PERCY:
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
LADY PERCY:
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,
LADY PERCY:
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,
LADY PERCY:
Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
LADY PERCY:
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
LADY PERCY:
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
LADY PERCY:
Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
LADY PERCY:
Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
LADY PERCY:
And all the currents of a heady fight.
LADY PERCY:
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
LADY PERCY:
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
LADY PERCY:
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
LADY PERCY:
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream,
LADY PERCY:
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
LADY PERCY:
Such as we see when men restrain their breath
LADY PERCY:
On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
LADY PERCY:
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
LADY PERCY:
And I must know it, else he loves me not.
HOTSPUR:
What, ho!
HOTSPUR:
Enter Servant
HOTSPUR:
Is Gilliams with the packet gone?
Servant:
He is, my lord, an hour ago.
HOTSPUR:
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
Servant:
One horse, my lord, he brought even now.
HOTSPUR:
What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
Servant:
It is, my lord.
HOTSPUR:
That roan shall by my throne.
HOTSPUR:
Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!
HOTSPUR:
Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.
HOTSPUR:
Exit Servant
LADY PERCY:
But hear you, my lord.
HOTSPUR:
What say'st thou, my lady?
LADY PERCY:
What is it carries you away?
HOTSPUR:
Why, my horse, my love, my horse.
LADY PERCY:
Out, you mad-headed ape!
LADY PERCY:
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
LADY PERCY:
As you are toss'd with. In faith,
LADY PERCY:
I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
LADY PERCY:
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
LADY PERCY:
About his title, and hath sent for you
LADY PERCY:
To line his enterprise: but if you go,--
HOTSPUR:
So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.
LADY PERCY:
Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
LADY PERCY:
Directly unto this question that I ask
LADY PERCY:
In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
LADY PERCY:
An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
HOTSPUR:
Away,
HOTSPUR:
Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,
HOTSPUR:
I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world
HOTSPUR:
To play with mammets and to tilt with lips
HOTSPUR:
We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
HOTSPUR:
And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!
HOTSPUR:
What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou
HOTSPUR:
have with me?
LADY PERCY:
Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
LADY PERCY:
Well, do not then, for since you love me not,
LADY PERCY:
I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
LADY PERCY:
Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.
HOTSPUR:
Come, wilt thou see me ride?
HOTSPUR:
And when I am on horseback, I will swear
HOTSPUR:
I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate,
HOTSPUR:
I must not have you henceforth question me
HOTSPUR:
Whither I go, nor reason whereabout
HOTSPUR:
Whither I must, I must, and, to conclude,
HOTSPUR:
This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
HOTSPUR:
I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
HOTSPUR:
Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,
HOTSPUR:
But yet a woman: and for secrecy,
HOTSPUR:
No lady closer, for I well believe
HOTSPUR:
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know,
HOTSPUR:
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
LADY PERCY:
How! so far?
HOTSPUR:
Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate
HOTSPUR:
Whither I go, thither shall you go too,
HOTSPUR:
To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.
HOTSPUR:
Will this content you, Kate?
LADY PERCY:
It must of force.
LADY PERCY:
Exeunt
LADY PERCY:
SCENE IV. The Boar's-Head Tavern, Eastcheap.
LADY PERCY:
Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
PRINCE HENRY:
Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me
PRINCE HENRY:
thy hand to laugh a little.
POINS:
Where hast been, Hal?
PRINCE HENRY:
With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
PRINCE HENRY:
score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
PRINCE HENRY:
base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother
PRINCE HENRY:
to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by
PRINCE HENRY:
their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
PRINCE HENRY:
They take it already upon their salvation, that
PRINCE HENRY:
though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king
PRINCE HENRY:
of courtesy, and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
PRINCE HENRY:
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
PRINCE HENRY:
good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I
PRINCE HENRY:
am king of England, I shall command all the good
PRINCE HENRY:
lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
PRINCE HENRY:
scarlet, and when you breathe in your watering, they
PRINCE HENRY:
cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
PRINCE HENRY:
am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
PRINCE HENRY:
that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
PRINCE HENRY:
during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
PRINCE HENRY:
much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet
PRINCE HENRY:
action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of
PRINCE HENRY:
Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
PRINCE HENRY:
even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that
PRINCE HENRY:
never spake other English in his life than 'Eight
PRINCE HENRY:
shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with
PRINCE HENRY:
this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint
PRINCE HENRY:
of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to
PRINCE HENRY:
drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
PRINCE HENRY:
do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my
PRINCE HENRY:
puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do
PRINCE HENRY:
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale
PRINCE HENRY:
to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and
PRINCE HENRY:
I'll show thee a precedent.
POINS:
Francis!
PRINCE HENRY:
Thou art perfect.
POINS:
Francis!
POINS:
Exit POINS
POINS:
Enter FRANCIS
FRANCIS:
Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.
PRINCE HENRY:
Come hither, Francis.
FRANCIS:
My lord?
PRINCE HENRY:
How long hast thou to serve, Francis?
FRANCIS:
Forsooth, five years, and as much as to--
POINS:
[Within]  Francis!
FRANCIS:
Anon, anon, sir.
PRINCE HENRY:
Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking
PRINCE HENRY:
of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant
PRINCE HENRY:
as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
PRINCE HENRY:
a fair pair of heels and run from it?
FRANCIS:
O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in
FRANCIS:
England, I could find in my heart.
POINS:
[Within]  Francis!
FRANCIS:
Anon, sir.
PRINCE HENRY:
How old art thou, Francis?
FRANCIS:
Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--
POINS:
[Within]  Francis!
FRANCIS:
Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.
PRINCE HENRY:
Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou
PRINCE HENRY:
gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?
FRANCIS:
O Lord, I would it had been two!
PRINCE HENRY:
I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me
PRINCE HENRY:
when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.
POINS:
[Within]  Francis!
FRANCIS:
Anon, anon.
PRINCE HENRY:
Anon, Francis? No, Francis, but to-morrow, Francis,
PRINCE HENRY:
or, Francis, o' Thursday, or indeed, Francis, when
PRINCE HENRY:
thou wilt. But, Francis!
FRANCIS:
My lord?
PRINCE HENRY:
Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,
PRINCE HENRY:
not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,
PRINCE HENRY:
smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--
FRANCIS:
O Lord, sir, who do you mean?
PRINCE HENRY:
Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink,
PRINCE HENRY:
for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet
PRINCE HENRY:
will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.
FRANCIS:
What, sir?
POINS:
[Within]  Francis!
PRINCE HENRY:
Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?
PRINCE HENRY:
Here they both call him, the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which way to go
PRINCE HENRY:
Enter Vintner
Vintner:
What, standest thou still, and hearest such a
Vintner:
calling? Look to the guests within.
Vintner:
Exit Francis
Vintner:
My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are
Vintner:
at the door: shall I let them in?
PRINCE HENRY:
Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit Vintner
PRINCE HENRY:
Poins!
PRINCE HENRY:
Re-enter POINS
POINS:
Anon, anon, sir.
PRINCE HENRY:
Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at
PRINCE HENRY:
the door: shall we be merry?
POINS:
As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye, what
POINS:
cunning match have you made with this jest of the
POINS:
drawer? come, what's the issue?
PRINCE HENRY:
I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
PRINCE HENRY:
humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
PRINCE HENRY:
pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.
PRINCE HENRY:
Re-enter FRANCIS
PRINCE HENRY:
What's o'clock, Francis?
FRANCIS:
Anon, anon, sir.
FRANCIS:
Exit
PRINCE HENRY:
That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
PRINCE HENRY:
parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is
PRINCE HENRY:
upstairs and downstairs, his eloquence the parcel of
PRINCE HENRY:
a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the
PRINCE HENRY:
Hotspur of the north, he that kills me some six or
PRINCE HENRY:
seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his
PRINCE HENRY:
hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet
PRINCE HENRY:
life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,
PRINCE HENRY:
'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan
PRINCE HENRY:
horse a drench,' says he, and answers 'Some
PRINCE HENRY:
fourteen,' an hour after, 'a trifle, a trifle.' I
PRINCE HENRY:
prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and
PRINCE HENRY:
that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
PRINCE HENRY:
wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.
PRINCE HENRY:
Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO, FRANCIS following with wine
POINS:
Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?
FALSTAFF:
A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
FALSTAFF:
marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
FALSTAFF:
lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
FALSTAFF:
them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
FALSTAFF:
Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?
FALSTAFF:
He drinks
PRINCE HENRY:
Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
PRINCE HENRY:
pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
PRINCE HENRY:
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.
FALSTAFF:
You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
FALSTAFF:
nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man
FALSTAFF:
yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
FALSTAFF:
in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack,
FALSTAFF:
die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
FALSTAFF:
not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
FALSTAFF:
shotten herring. There live not three good men
FALSTAFF:
unhanged in England, and one of them is fat and
FALSTAFF:
grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
FALSTAFF:
I would I were a weaver, I could sing psalms or any
FALSTAFF:
thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.
PRINCE HENRY:
How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?
FALSTAFF:
A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
FALSTAFF:
kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
FALSTAFF:
subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,
FALSTAFF:
I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!
PRINCE HENRY:
Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?
FALSTAFF:
Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?
POINS:
'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the
POINS:
Lord, I'll stab thee.
FALSTAFF:
I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
FALSTAFF:
thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
FALSTAFF:
could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
FALSTAFF:
enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
FALSTAFF:
back: call you that backing of your friends? A
FALSTAFF:
plague upon such backing! give me them that will
FALSTAFF:
face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I
FALSTAFF:
drunk to-day.
PRINCE HENRY:
O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
PRINCE HENRY:
drunkest last.
FALSTAFF:
All's one for that.
FALSTAFF:
He drinks
FALSTAFF:
A plague of all cowards, still say I.
PRINCE HENRY:
What's the matter?
FALSTAFF:
What's the matter! there be four of us here have
FALSTAFF:
ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.
PRINCE HENRY:
Where is it, Jack? where is it?
FALSTAFF:
Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
FALSTAFF:
poor four of us.
PRINCE HENRY:
What, a hundred, man?
FALSTAFF:
I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
FALSTAFF:
dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
FALSTAFF:
miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
FALSTAFF:
doublet, four through the hose, my buckler cut
FALSTAFF:
through and through, my sword hacked like a
FALSTAFF:
hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since
FALSTAFF:
I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
FALSTAFF:
cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
FALSTAFF:
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
PRINCE HENRY:
Speak, sirs, how was it?
GADSHILL:
We four set upon some dozen--
FALSTAFF:
Sixteen at least, my lord.
GADSHILL:
And bound them.
PETO:
No, no, they were not bound.
FALSTAFF:
You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I
FALSTAFF:
am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
GADSHILL:
As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--
FALSTAFF:
And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
PRINCE HENRY:
What, fought you with them all?
FALSTAFF:
All! I know not what you call all, but if I fought
FALSTAFF:
not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
FALSTAFF:
there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
FALSTAFF:
Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.
PRINCE HENRY:
Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
FALSTAFF:
Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
FALSTAFF:
of them, two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
FALSTAFF:
in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
FALSTAFF:
thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
FALSTAFF:
knowest my old ward, here I lay and thus I bore my
FALSTAFF:
point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
PRINCE HENRY:
What, four? thou saidst but two even now.
FALSTAFF:
Four, Hal, I told thee four.
POINS:
Ay, ay, he said four.
FALSTAFF:
These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
FALSTAFF:
me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
FALSTAFF:
points in my target, thus.
PRINCE HENRY:
Seven? why, there were but four even now.
FALSTAFF:
In buckram?
POINS:
Ay, four, in buckram suits.
FALSTAFF:
Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
PRINCE HENRY:
Prithee, let him alone, we shall have more anon.
FALSTAFF:
Dost thou hear me, Hal?
PRINCE HENRY:
Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
FALSTAFF:
Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
FALSTAFF:
in buckram that I told thee of--
PRINCE HENRY:
So, two more already.
FALSTAFF:
Their points being broken,--
POINS:
Down fell their hose.
FALSTAFF:
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
FALSTAFF:
came in foot and hand, and with a thought seven of
FALSTAFF:
the eleven I paid.
PRINCE HENRY:
O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
FALSTAFF:
But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
FALSTAFF:
knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
FALSTAFF:
at me, for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
FALSTAFF:
not see thy hand.
PRINCE HENRY:
These lies are like their father that begets them,
PRINCE HENRY:
gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
PRINCE HENRY:
clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
PRINCE HENRY:
whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--
FALSTAFF:
What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
FALSTAFF:
the truth?
PRINCE HENRY:
Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
PRINCE HENRY:
green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
PRINCE HENRY:
hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?
POINS:
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
FALSTAFF:
What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the
FALSTAFF:
strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
FALSTAFF:
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
FALSTAFF:
compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
FALSTAFF:
blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
FALSTAFF:
compulsion, I.
PRINCE HENRY:
I'll be no longer guilty of this sin, this sanguine
PRINCE HENRY:
coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
PRINCE HENRY:
this huge hill of flesh,--
FALSTAFF:
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
FALSTAFF:
neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O
FALSTAFF:
for breath to utter what is like thee! you
FALSTAFF:
tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase, you vile
FALSTAFF:
standing-tuck,--
PRINCE HENRY:
Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
PRINCE HENRY:
when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,
PRINCE HENRY:
hear me speak but this.
POINS:
Mark, Jack.
PRINCE HENRY:
We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and
PRINCE HENRY:
were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
PRINCE HENRY:
tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
PRINCE HENRY:
four, and, with a word, out-faced you from your
PRINCE HENRY:
prize, and have it, yea, and can show it you here in
PRINCE HENRY:
the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
PRINCE HENRY:
away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
PRINCE HENRY:
for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
PRINCE HENRY:
bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
PRINCE HENRY:
as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
PRINCE HENRY:
What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
PRINCE HENRY:
thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
PRINCE HENRY:
apparent shame?
POINS:
Come, let's hear, Jack, what trick hast thou now?
FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
FALSTAFF:
Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
FALSTAFF:
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
FALSTAFF:
why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
FALSTAFF:
beware instinct, the lion will not touch the true
FALSTAFF:
prince. Instinct is a great matter, I was now a
FALSTAFF:
coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
FALSTAFF:
myself and thee during my life, I for a valiant
FALSTAFF:
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
FALSTAFF:
lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
FALSTAFF:
to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
FALSTAFF:
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
FALSTAFF:
of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
FALSTAFF:
merry? shall we have a play extempore?
PRINCE HENRY:
Content, and the argument shall be thy running away.
FALSTAFF:
Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!
FALSTAFF:
Enter Hostess
Hostess:
O Jesu, my lord the prince!
PRINCE HENRY:
How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to
PRINCE HENRY:
me?
Hostess:
Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at
Hostess:
door would speak with you: he says he comes from
Hostess:
your father.
PRINCE HENRY:
Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and
PRINCE HENRY:
send him back again to my mother.
FALSTAFF:
What manner of man is he?
Hostess:
An old man.
FALSTAFF:
What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
FALSTAFF:
I give him his answer?
PRINCE HENRY:
Prithee, do, Jack.
FALSTAFF:
'Faith, and I'll send him packing.
FALSTAFF:
Exit FALSTAFF
PRINCE HENRY:
Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair, so did you,
PRINCE HENRY:
Peto, so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you
PRINCE HENRY:
ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
PRINCE HENRY:
prince, no, fie!
BARDOLPH:
'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
PRINCE HENRY:
'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
PRINCE HENRY:
sword so hacked?
PETO:
Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
PETO:
swear truth out of England but he would make you
PETO:
believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.
BARDOLPH:
Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
BARDOLPH:
make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
BARDOLPH:
with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
BARDOLPH:
did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
BARDOLPH:
to hear his monstrous devices.
PRINCE HENRY:
O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
PRINCE HENRY:
ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
PRINCE HENRY:
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
PRINCE HENRY:
sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
PRINCE HENRY:
instinct hadst thou for it?
BARDOLPH:
My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
BARDOLPH:
these exhalations?
PRINCE HENRY:
I do.
BARDOLPH:
What think you they portend?
PRINCE HENRY:
Hot livers and cold purses.
BARDOLPH:
Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
PRINCE HENRY:
No, if rightly taken, halter.
PRINCE HENRY:
Re-enter FALSTAFF
PRINCE HENRY:
Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.
PRINCE HENRY:
How now, my sweet creature of bombast!
PRINCE HENRY:
How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?
FALSTAFF:
My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was
FALSTAFF:
not an eagle's talon in the waist, I could have
FALSTAFF:
crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
FALSTAFF:
sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
FALSTAFF:
bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
FALSTAFF:
Sir John Bracy from your father, you must to the
FALSTAFF:
court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
FALSTAFF:
north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
FALSTAFF:
bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
FALSTAFF:
devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
FALSTAFF:
hook--what a plague call you him?
POINS:
O, Glendower.
FALSTAFF:
Owen, Owen, the same, and his son-in-law Mortimer,
FALSTAFF:
and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
FALSTAFF:
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
FALSTAFF:
perpendicular,--
PRINCE HENRY:
He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
PRINCE HENRY:
kills a sparrow flying.
FALSTAFF:
You have hit it.
PRINCE HENRY:
So did he never the sparrow.
FALSTAFF:
Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him, he will not run.
PRINCE HENRY:
Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so
PRINCE HENRY:
for running!
FALSTAFF:
O' horseback, ye cuckoo, but afoot he will not budge a foot.
PRINCE HENRY:
Yes, Jack, upon instinct.
FALSTAFF:
I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
FALSTAFF:
and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more
FALSTAFF:
Worcester is stolen away to-night, thy father's
FALSTAFF:
beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
FALSTAFF:
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
PRINCE HENRY:
Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and
PRINCE HENRY:
this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
PRINCE HENRY:
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.
FALSTAFF:
By the mass, lad, thou sayest true, it is like we
FALSTAFF:
shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
FALSTAFF:
art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
FALSTAFF:
heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
FALSTAFF:
such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
FALSTAFF:
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
FALSTAFF:
not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
FALSTAFF:
it?
PRINCE HENRY:
Not a whit, i' faith, I lack some of thy instinct.
FALSTAFF:
Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
FALSTAFF:
comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.
PRINCE HENRY:
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
PRINCE HENRY:
particulars of my life.
FALSTAFF:
Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
FALSTAFF:
this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.
PRINCE HENRY:
Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
PRINCE HENRY:
sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
PRINCE HENRY:
crown for a pitiful bald crown!
FALSTAFF:
Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
FALSTAFF:
now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
FALSTAFF:
make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
FALSTAFF:
wept, for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
FALSTAFF:
in King Cambyses' vein.
PRINCE HENRY:
Well, here is my leg.
FALSTAFF:
And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.
Hostess:
O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
FALSTAFF:
Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain.
Hostess:
O, the father, how he holds his countenance!
FALSTAFF:
For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen,
FALSTAFF:
For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
Hostess:
O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
Hostess:
players as ever I see!
FALSTAFF:
Peace, good pint-pot, peace, good tickle-brain.
FALSTAFF:
Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
FALSTAFF:
time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
FALSTAFF:
the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
FALSTAFF:
it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
FALSTAFF:
sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
FALSTAFF:
partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
FALSTAFF:
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
FALSTAFF:
foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
FALSTAFF:
me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point,
FALSTAFF:
why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
FALSTAFF:
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
FALSTAFF:
blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
FALSTAFF:
the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
FALSTAFF:
question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
FALSTAFF:
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
FALSTAFF:
many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
FALSTAFF:
as ancient writers do report, doth defile, so doth
FALSTAFF:
the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
FALSTAFF:
speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
FALSTAFF:
pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
FALSTAFF:
woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
FALSTAFF:
have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
PRINCE HENRY:
What manner of man, an it like your majesty?
FALSTAFF:
A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent, of a
FALSTAFF:
cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
FALSTAFF:
carriage, and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
FALSTAFF:
by'r lady, inclining to three score, and now I
FALSTAFF:
remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
FALSTAFF:
should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me, for, Harry,
FALSTAFF:
I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
FALSTAFF:
known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
FALSTAFF:
peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
FALSTAFF:
Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
FALSTAFF:
me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
FALSTAFF:
thou been this month?
PRINCE HENRY:
Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
PRINCE HENRY:
and I'll play my father.
FALSTAFF:
Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
FALSTAFF:
majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
FALSTAFF:
the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
PRINCE HENRY:
Well, here I am set.
FALSTAFF:
And here I stand: judge, my masters.
PRINCE HENRY:
Now, Harry, whence come you?
FALSTAFF:
My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
PRINCE HENRY:
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
FALSTAFF:
'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
FALSTAFF:
ye for a young prince, i' faith.
PRINCE HENRY:
Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look
PRINCE HENRY:
on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace
PRINCE HENRY:
there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
PRINCE HENRY:
old fat man, a tun of man is thy companion. Why
PRINCE HENRY:
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
PRINCE HENRY:
bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
PRINCE HENRY:
of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
PRINCE HENRY:
cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
PRINCE HENRY:
the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
PRINCE HENRY:
grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
PRINCE HENRY:
years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
PRINCE HENRY:
drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
PRINCE HENRY:
capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
PRINCE HENRY:
wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
PRINCE HENRY:
but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?
FALSTAFF:
I would your grace would take me with you: whom
FALSTAFF:
means your grace?
PRINCE HENRY:
That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
PRINCE HENRY:
Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.
FALSTAFF:
My lord, the man I know.
PRINCE HENRY:
I know thou dost.
FALSTAFF:
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
FALSTAFF:
were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
FALSTAFF:
more the pity, his white hairs do witness it, but
FALSTAFF:
that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
FALSTAFF:
that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
FALSTAFF:
God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
FALSTAFF:
sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
FALSTAFF:
to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
FALSTAFF:
are to be loved. No, my good lord, banish Peto,
FALSTAFF:
banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
FALSTAFF:
Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
FALSTAFF:
valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
FALSTAFF:
being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
FALSTAFF:
thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
FALSTAFF:
company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.
PRINCE HENRY:
I do, I will.
PRINCE HENRY:
A knocking heard
PRINCE HENRY:
Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH
PRINCE HENRY:
Re-enter BARDOLPH, running
BARDOLPH:
O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
BARDOLPH:
monstrous watch is at the door.
FALSTAFF:
Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to
FALSTAFF:
say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
FALSTAFF:
Re-enter the Hostess
Hostess:
O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
PRINCE HENRY:
Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick
PRINCE HENRY:
what's the matter?
Hostess:
The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
Hostess:
are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?
FALSTAFF:
Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
FALSTAFF:
gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
FALSTAFF:
without seeming so.
PRINCE HENRY:
And thou a natural coward, without instinct.
FALSTAFF:
I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
FALSTAFF:
so, if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
FALSTAFF:
as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
FALSTAFF:
I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
PRINCE HENRY:
Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
PRINCE HENRY:
above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
PRINCE HENRY:
conscience.
FALSTAFF:
Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
FALSTAFF:
therefore I'll hide me.
PRINCE HENRY:
Call in the sheriff.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO
PRINCE HENRY:
Enter Sheriff and the Carrier
PRINCE HENRY:
Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
Sheriff:
First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
Sheriff:
Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.
PRINCE HENRY:
What men?
Sheriff:
One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
Sheriff:
A gross fat man.
Carrier:
As fat as butter.
PRINCE HENRY:
The man, I do assure you, is not here,
PRINCE HENRY:
For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
PRINCE HENRY:
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
PRINCE HENRY:
That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
PRINCE HENRY:
Send him to answer thee, or any man,
PRINCE HENRY:
For any thing he shall be charged withal
PRINCE HENRY:
And so let me entreat you leave the house.
Sheriff:
I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
Sheriff:
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
PRINCE HENRY:
It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
PRINCE HENRY:
He shall be answerable, and so farewell.
Sheriff:
Good night, my noble lord.
PRINCE HENRY:
I think it is good morrow, is it not?
Sheriff:
Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
Sheriff:
Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier
PRINCE HENRY:
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,
PRINCE HENRY:
call him forth.
PETO:
Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and
PETO:
snorting like a horse.
PRINCE HENRY:
Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
PRINCE HENRY:
He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers
PRINCE HENRY:
What hast thou found?
PETO:
Nothing but papers, my lord.
PRINCE HENRY:
Let's see what they be: read them.
PETO:
[Reads]  Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.
PETO:
Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.
PETO:
Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.
PETO:
Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.
PETO:
Item, Bread,        ob.
PRINCE HENRY:
O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
PRINCE HENRY:
this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
PRINCE HENRY:
keep close, we'll read it at more advantage: there
PRINCE HENRY:
let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
PRINCE HENRY:
morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
PRINCE HENRY:
shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
PRINCE HENRY:
charge of foot, and I know his death will be a
PRINCE HENRY:
march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
PRINCE HENRY:
back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
PRINCE HENRY:
the morning, and so, good morrow, Peto.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exeunt
PETO:
Good morrow, good my lord.
PETO:
ACT III
PETO:
SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.
PETO:
Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER
MORTIMER:
These promises are fair, the parties sure,
MORTIMER:
And our induction full of prosperous hope.
HOTSPUR:
Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
HOTSPUR:
Will you sit down?
HOTSPUR:
And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
HOTSPUR:
I have forgot the map.
GLENDOWER:
No, here it is.
GLENDOWER:
Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur,
GLENDOWER:
For by that name as oft as Lancaster
GLENDOWER:
Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
GLENDOWER:
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
HOTSPUR:
And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
GLENDOWER:
I cannot blame him: at my nativity
GLENDOWER:
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
GLENDOWER:
Of burning cressets, and at my birth
GLENDOWER:
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
GLENDOWER:
Shaked like a coward.
HOTSPUR:
Why, so it would have done at the same season, if
HOTSPUR:
your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
HOTSPUR:
had never been born.
GLENDOWER:
I say the earth did shake when I was born.
HOTSPUR:
And I say the earth was not of my mind,
HOTSPUR:
If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
GLENDOWER:
The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
HOTSPUR:
O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
HOTSPUR:
And not in fear of your nativity.
HOTSPUR:
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
HOTSPUR:
In strange eruptions, oft the teeming earth
HOTSPUR:
Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
HOTSPUR:
By the imprisoning of unruly wind
HOTSPUR:
Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,
HOTSPUR:
Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
HOTSPUR:
Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
HOTSPUR:
Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
HOTSPUR:
In passion shook.
GLENDOWER:
Cousin, of many men
GLENDOWER:
I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
GLENDOWER:
To tell you once again that at my birth
GLENDOWER:
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
GLENDOWER:
The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
GLENDOWER:
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
GLENDOWER:
These signs have mark'd me extraordinary,
GLENDOWER:
And all the courses of my life do show
GLENDOWER:
I am not in the roll of common men.
GLENDOWER:
Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
GLENDOWER:
That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
GLENDOWER:
Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
GLENDOWER:
And bring him out that is but woman's son
GLENDOWER:
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
GLENDOWER:
And hold me pace in deep experiments.
HOTSPUR:
I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
HOTSPUR:
I'll to dinner.
MORTIMER:
Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad.
GLENDOWER:
I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
HOTSPUR:
Why, so can I, or so can any man,
HOTSPUR:
But will they come when you do call for them?
GLENDOWER:
Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
GLENDOWER:
The devil.
HOTSPUR:
And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
HOTSPUR:
By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
HOTSPUR:
If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
HOTSPUR:
And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
HOTSPUR:
O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
MORTIMER:
Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
GLENDOWER:
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
GLENDOWER:
Against my power, thrice from the banks of Wye
GLENDOWER:
And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
GLENDOWER:
Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
HOTSPUR:
Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
HOTSPUR:
How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?
GLENDOWER:
Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
GLENDOWER:
According to our threefold order ta'en?
MORTIMER:
The archdeacon hath divided it
MORTIMER:
Into three limits very equally
MORTIMER:
England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
MORTIMER:
By south and east is to my part assign'd
MORTIMER:
All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
MORTIMER:
And all the fertile land within that bound,
MORTIMER:
To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
MORTIMER:
The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
MORTIMER:
And our indentures tripartite are drawn,
MORTIMER:
Which being sealed interchangeably,
MORTIMER:
A business that this night may execute,
MORTIMER:
To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
MORTIMER:
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
MORTIMER:
To meet your father and the Scottish power,
MORTIMER:
As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
MORTIMER:
My father Glendower is not ready yet,
MORTIMER:
Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
MORTIMER:
Within that space you may have drawn together
MORTIMER:
Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.
GLENDOWER:
A shorter time shall send me to you, lords
GLENDOWER:
And in my conduct shall your ladies come,
GLENDOWER:
From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
GLENDOWER:
For there will be a world of water shed
GLENDOWER:
Upon the parting of your wives and you.
HOTSPUR:
Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
HOTSPUR:
In quantity equals not one of yours
HOTSPUR:
See how this river comes me cranking in,
HOTSPUR:
And cuts me from the best of all my land
HOTSPUR:
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
HOTSPUR:
I'll have the current in this place damm'd up,
HOTSPUR:
And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
HOTSPUR:
In a new channel, fair and evenly,
HOTSPUR:
It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
HOTSPUR:
To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
GLENDOWER:
Not wind? it shall, it must, you see it doth.
MORTIMER:
Yea, but
MORTIMER:
Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
MORTIMER:
With like advantage on the other side,
MORTIMER:
Gelding the opposed continent as much
MORTIMER:
As on the other side it takes from you.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And on this north side win this cape of land,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And then he runs straight and even.
HOTSPUR:
I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
GLENDOWER:
I'll not have it alter'd.
HOTSPUR:
Will not you?
GLENDOWER:
No, nor you shall not.
HOTSPUR:
Who shall say me nay?
GLENDOWER:
Why, that will I.
HOTSPUR:
Let me not understand you, then, speak it in Welsh.
GLENDOWER:
I can speak English, lord, as well as you,
GLENDOWER:
For I was train'd up in the English court,
GLENDOWER:
Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
GLENDOWER:
Many an English ditty lovely well
GLENDOWER:
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
GLENDOWER:
A virtue that was never seen in you.
HOTSPUR:
Marry,
HOTSPUR:
And I am glad of it with all my heart
HOTSPUR:
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
HOTSPUR:
Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers,
HOTSPUR:
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,
HOTSPUR:
Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree,
HOTSPUR:
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
HOTSPUR:
Nothing so much as mincing poetry
HOTSPUR:
'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
GLENDOWER:
Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.
HOTSPUR:
I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
HOTSPUR:
To any well-deserving friend,
HOTSPUR:
But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
HOTSPUR:
I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
HOTSPUR:
Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
GLENDOWER:
The moon shines fair, you may away by night
GLENDOWER:
I'll haste the writer and withal
GLENDOWER:
Break with your wives of your departure hence
GLENDOWER:
I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
GLENDOWER:
So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
GLENDOWER:
Exit GLENDOWER
MORTIMER:
Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
HOTSPUR:
I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
HOTSPUR:
With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
HOTSPUR:
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
HOTSPUR:
And of a dragon and a finless fish,
HOTSPUR:
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
HOTSPUR:
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
HOTSPUR:
And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
HOTSPUR:
As puts me from my faith. I tell you what,
HOTSPUR:
He held me last night at least nine hours
HOTSPUR:
In reckoning up the several devils' names
HOTSPUR:
That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
HOTSPUR:
But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
HOTSPUR:
As a tired horse, a railing wife,
HOTSPUR:
Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
HOTSPUR:
With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
HOTSPUR:
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
HOTSPUR:
In any summer-house in Christendom.
MORTIMER:
In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
MORTIMER:
Exceedingly well read, and profited
MORTIMER:
In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
MORTIMER:
And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
MORTIMER:
As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
MORTIMER:
He holds your temper in a high respect
MORTIMER:
And curbs himself even of his natural scope
MORTIMER:
When you come 'cross his humour, faith, he does
MORTIMER:
I warrant you, that man is not alive
MORTIMER:
Might so have tempted him as you have done,
MORTIMER:
Without the taste of danger and reproof
MORTIMER:
But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And since your coming hither have done enough
EARL OF WORCESTER:
To put him quite beside his patience.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Defect of manners, want of government,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The least of which haunting a nobleman
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Beguiling them of commendation.
HOTSPUR:
Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!
HOTSPUR:
Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.
HOTSPUR:
Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies
MORTIMER:
This is the deadly spite that angers me,
MORTIMER:
My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
GLENDOWER:
My daughter weeps: she will not part with you,
GLENDOWER:
She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
MORTIMER:
Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
MORTIMER:
Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
MORTIMER:
Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same
GLENDOWER:
She is desperate here, a peevish self-wind harlotry,
GLENDOWER:
one that no persuasion can do good upon.
GLENDOWER:
The lady speaks in Welsh
MORTIMER:
I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
MORTIMER:
Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
MORTIMER:
I am too perfect in, and, but for shame,
MORTIMER:
In such a parley should I answer thee.
MORTIMER:
The lady speaks again in Welsh
MORTIMER:
I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
MORTIMER:
And that's a feeling disputation
MORTIMER:
But I will never be a truant, love,
MORTIMER:
Till I have learned thy language, for thy tongue
MORTIMER:
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
MORTIMER:
Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
MORTIMER:
With ravishing division, to her lute.
GLENDOWER:
Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
GLENDOWER:
The lady speaks again in Welsh
MORTIMER:
O, I am ignorance itself in this!
GLENDOWER:
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
GLENDOWER:
And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
GLENDOWER:
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
GLENDOWER:
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
GLENDOWER:
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
GLENDOWER:
Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
GLENDOWER:
As is the difference betwixt day and night
GLENDOWER:
The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
GLENDOWER:
Begins his golden progress in the east.
MORTIMER:
With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing
MORTIMER:
By that time will our book, I think, be drawn
GLENDOWER:
Do so,
GLENDOWER:
And those musicians that shall play to you
GLENDOWER:
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
GLENDOWER:
And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.
HOTSPUR:
Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,
HOTSPUR:
quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.
LADY PERCY:
Go, ye giddy goose.
LADY PERCY:
The music plays
HOTSPUR:
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,
HOTSPUR:
And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
HOTSPUR:
By'r lady, he is a good musician.
LADY PERCY:
Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
LADY PERCY:
altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
LADY PERCY:
and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
HOTSPUR:
I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
LADY PERCY:
Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
HOTSPUR:
No.
LADY PERCY:
Then be still.
HOTSPUR:
Neither,'tis a woman's fault.
LADY PERCY:
Now God help thee!
HOTSPUR:
To the Welsh lady's bed.
LADY PERCY:
What's that?
HOTSPUR:
Peace! she sings.
HOTSPUR:
Here the lady sings a Welsh song
HOTSPUR:
Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.
LADY PERCY:
Not mine, in good sooth.
HOTSPUR:
Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a
HOTSPUR:
comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and
HOTSPUR:
'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
HOTSPUR:
'as sure as day,'
HOTSPUR:
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
HOTSPUR:
As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
HOTSPUR:
Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
HOTSPUR:
A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
HOTSPUR:
And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
HOTSPUR:
To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
HOTSPUR:
Come, sing.
LADY PERCY:
I will not sing.
HOTSPUR:
'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast
HOTSPUR:
teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away
HOTSPUR:
within these two hours, and so, come in when ye will.
HOTSPUR:
Exit
GLENDOWER:
Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow
GLENDOWER:
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
GLENDOWER:
By this our book is drawn, we'll but seal,
GLENDOWER:
And then to horse immediately.
MORTIMER:
With all my heart.
MORTIMER:
Exeunt
MORTIMER:
SCENE II. London. The palace.
MORTIMER:
Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others
KING HENRY IV:
Lords, give us leave, the Prince of Wales and I
KING HENRY IV:
Must have some private conference, but be near at hand,
KING HENRY IV:
For we shall presently have need of you.
KING HENRY IV:
Exeunt Lords
KING HENRY IV:
I know not whether God will have it so,
KING HENRY IV:
For some displeasing service I have done,
KING HENRY IV:
That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
KING HENRY IV:
He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me,
KING HENRY IV:
But thou dost in thy passages of life
KING HENRY IV:
Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
KING HENRY IV:
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
KING HENRY IV:
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
KING HENRY IV:
Could such inordinate and low desires,
KING HENRY IV:
Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
KING HENRY IV:
Such barren pleasures, rude society,
KING HENRY IV:
As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
KING HENRY IV:
Accompany the greatness of thy blood
KING HENRY IV:
And hold their level with thy princely heart?
PRINCE HENRY:
So please your majesty, I would I could
PRINCE HENRY:
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
PRINCE HENRY:
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
PRINCE HENRY:
Myself of many I am charged withal
PRINCE HENRY:
Yet such extenuation let me beg,
PRINCE HENRY:
As, in reproof of many tales devised,
PRINCE HENRY:
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
PRINCE HENRY:
By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
PRINCE HENRY:
I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
PRINCE HENRY:
Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
PRINCE HENRY:
Find pardon on my true submission.
KING HENRY IV:
God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
KING HENRY IV:
At thy affections, which do hold a wing
KING HENRY IV:
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
KING HENRY IV:
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
KING HENRY IV:
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
KING HENRY IV:
And art almost an alien to the hearts
KING HENRY IV:
Of all the court and princes of my blood
KING HENRY IV:
The hope and expectation of thy time
KING HENRY IV:
Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
KING HENRY IV:
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
KING HENRY IV:
Had I so lavish of my presence been,
KING HENRY IV:
So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
KING HENRY IV:
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
KING HENRY IV:
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
KING HENRY IV:
Had still kept loyal to possession
KING HENRY IV:
And left me in reputeless banishment,
KING HENRY IV:
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
KING HENRY IV:
By being seldom seen, I could not stir
KING HENRY IV:
But like a comet I was wonder'd at,
KING HENRY IV:
That men would tell their children 'This is he,'
KING HENRY IV:
Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
KING HENRY IV:
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
KING HENRY IV:
And dress'd myself in such humility
KING HENRY IV:
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
KING HENRY IV:
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
KING HENRY IV:
Even in the presence of the crowned king.
KING HENRY IV:
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,
KING HENRY IV:
My presence, like a robe pontifical,
KING HENRY IV:
Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
KING HENRY IV:
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
KING HENRY IV:
And won by rareness such solemnity.
KING HENRY IV:
The skipping king, he ambled up and down
KING HENRY IV:
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
KING HENRY IV:
Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,
KING HENRY IV:
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
KING HENRY IV:
Had his great name profaned with their scorns
KING HENRY IV:
And gave his countenance, against his name,
KING HENRY IV:
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
KING HENRY IV:
Of every beardless vain comparative,
KING HENRY IV:
Grew a companion to the common streets,
KING HENRY IV:
Enfeoff'd himself to popularity,
KING HENRY IV:
That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
KING HENRY IV:
They surfeited with honey and began
KING HENRY IV:
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
KING HENRY IV:
More than a little is by much too much.
KING HENRY IV:
So when he had occasion to be seen,
KING HENRY IV:
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
KING HENRY IV:
Heard, not regarded, seen, but with such eyes
KING HENRY IV:
As, sick and blunted with community,
KING HENRY IV:
Afford no extraordinary gaze,
KING HENRY IV:
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
KING HENRY IV:
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes,
KING HENRY IV:
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
KING HENRY IV:
Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
KING HENRY IV:
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
KING HENRY IV:
Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
KING HENRY IV:
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,
KING HENRY IV:
For thou has lost thy princely privilege
KING HENRY IV:
With vile participation: not an eye
KING HENRY IV:
But is a-weary of thy common sight,
KING HENRY IV:
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,
KING HENRY IV:
Which now doth that I would not have it do,
KING HENRY IV:
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
PRINCE HENRY:
I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
PRINCE HENRY:
Be more myself.
KING HENRY IV:
For all the world
KING HENRY IV:
As thou art to this hour was Richard then
KING HENRY IV:
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
KING HENRY IV:
And even as I was then is Percy now.
KING HENRY IV:
Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
KING HENRY IV:
He hath more worthy interest to the state
KING HENRY IV:
Than thou the shadow of succession,
KING HENRY IV:
For of no right, nor colour like to right,
KING HENRY IV:
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
KING HENRY IV:
Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
KING HENRY IV:
And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
KING HENRY IV:
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
KING HENRY IV:
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
KING HENRY IV:
What never-dying honour hath he got
KING HENRY IV:
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
KING HENRY IV:
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
KING HENRY IV:
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
KING HENRY IV:
And military title capital
KING HENRY IV:
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ
KING HENRY IV:
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
KING HENRY IV:
This infant warrior, in his enterprises
KING HENRY IV:
Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
KING HENRY IV:
Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
KING HENRY IV:
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
KING HENRY IV:
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
KING HENRY IV:
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
KING HENRY IV:
The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
KING HENRY IV:
Capitulate against us and are up.
KING HENRY IV:
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
KING HENRY IV:
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
KING HENRY IV:
Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
KING HENRY IV:
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
KING HENRY IV:
Base inclination and the start of spleen
KING HENRY IV:
To fight against me under Percy's pay,
KING HENRY IV:
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
KING HENRY IV:
To show how much thou art degenerate.
PRINCE HENRY:
Do not think so, you shall not find it so
PRINCE HENRY:
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
PRINCE HENRY:
Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
PRINCE HENRY:
I will redeem all this on Percy's head
PRINCE HENRY:
And in the closing of some glorious day
PRINCE HENRY:
Be bold to tell you that I am your son,
PRINCE HENRY:
When I will wear a garment all of blood
PRINCE HENRY:
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
PRINCE HENRY:
Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it
PRINCE HENRY:
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
PRINCE HENRY:
That this same child of honour and renown,
PRINCE HENRY:
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
PRINCE HENRY:
And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
PRINCE HENRY:
For every honour sitting on his helm,
PRINCE HENRY:
Would they were multitudes, and on my head
PRINCE HENRY:
My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
PRINCE HENRY:
That I shall make this northern youth exchange
PRINCE HENRY:
His glorious deeds for my indignities.
PRINCE HENRY:
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
PRINCE HENRY:
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf,
PRINCE HENRY:
And I will call him to so strict account,
PRINCE HENRY:
That he shall render every glory up,
PRINCE HENRY:
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
PRINCE HENRY:
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
PRINCE HENRY:
This, in the name of God, I promise here
PRINCE HENRY:
The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
PRINCE HENRY:
I do beseech your majesty may salve
PRINCE HENRY:
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance
PRINCE HENRY:
If not, the end of life cancels all bands,
PRINCE HENRY:
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
PRINCE HENRY:
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
KING HENRY IV:
A hundred thousand rebels die in this
KING HENRY IV:
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
KING HENRY IV:
Enter BLUNT
KING HENRY IV:
How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
So hath the business that I come to speak of.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
That Douglas and the English rebels met
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
If promises be kept on every hand,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
As ever offer'd foul play in the state.
KING HENRY IV:
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day,
KING HENRY IV:
With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster,
KING HENRY IV:
For this advertisement is five days old
KING HENRY IV:
On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward,
KING HENRY IV:
On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
KING HENRY IV:
Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march
KING HENRY IV:
Through Gloucestershire, by which account,
KING HENRY IV:
Our business valued, some twelve days hence
KING HENRY IV:
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
KING HENRY IV:
Our hands are full of business: let's away,
KING HENRY IV:
Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.
KING HENRY IV:
Exeunt
Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.
Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
FALSTAFF:
action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
FALSTAFF:
skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
FALSTAFF:
gown, I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
FALSTAFF:
I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
FALSTAFF:
liking, I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
FALSTAFF:
shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
FALSTAFF:
forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
FALSTAFF:
am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
FALSTAFF:
church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
FALSTAFF:
spoil of me.
BARDOLPH:
Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.
FALSTAFF:
Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song, make
FALSTAFF:
me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
FALSTAFF:
need to be, virtuous enough, swore little, diced not
FALSTAFF:
above seven times a week, went to a bawdy-house once
FALSTAFF:
in a quarter--of an hour, paid money that I
FALSTAFF:
borrowed, three of four times, lived well and in
FALSTAFF:
good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
FALSTAFF:
of all compass.
BARDOLPH:
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
BARDOLPH:
be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
BARDOLPH:
compass, Sir John.
FALSTAFF:
Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life
FALSTAFF:
thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
FALSTAFF:
the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee, thou art the
FALSTAFF:
Knight of the Burning Lamp.
BARDOLPH:
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
FALSTAFF:
No, I'll be sworn, I make as good use of it as many
FALSTAFF:
a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
FALSTAFF:
never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
FALSTAFF:
Dives that lived in purple, for there he is in his
FALSTAFF:
robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
FALSTAFF:
given to virtue, I would swear by thy face, my oath
FALSTAFF:
should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
FALSTAFF:
thou art altogether given over, and wert indeed, but
FALSTAFF:
for the light in thy face, the son of utter
FALSTAFF:
darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the
FALSTAFF:
night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
FALSTAFF:
hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
FALSTAFF:
there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a
FALSTAFF:
perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
FALSTAFF:
Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
FALSTAFF:
torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
FALSTAFF:
tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
FALSTAFF:
drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
FALSTAFF:
at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
FALSTAFF:
maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
FALSTAFF:
time this two and thirty years, God reward me for
FALSTAFF:
it!
BARDOLPH:
'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!
FALSTAFF:
God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
FALSTAFF:
Enter Hostess
FALSTAFF:
How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired
FALSTAFF:
yet who picked my pocket?
Hostess:
Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you
Hostess:
think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,
Hostess:
I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy
Hostess:
by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
Hostess:
was never lost in my house before.
FALSTAFF:
Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
FALSTAFF:
a hair, and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
FALSTAFF:
to, you are a woman, go.
Hostess:
Who, I? no, I defy thee: God's light, I was never
Hostess:
called so in mine own house before.
FALSTAFF:
Go to, I know you well enough.
Hostess:
No, Sir John, You do not know me, Sir John. I know
Hostess:
you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John, and now
Hostess:
you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
Hostess:
you a dozen of shirts to your back.
FALSTAFF:
Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
FALSTAFF:
bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.
Hostess:
Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight
Hostess:
shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir
Hostess:
John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent
Hostess:
you, four and twenty pound.
FALSTAFF:
He had his part of it, let him pay.
Hostess:
He? alas, he is poor, he hath nothing.
FALSTAFF:
How! poor? look upon his face, what call you rich?
FALSTAFF:
let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks
FALSTAFF:
Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
FALSTAFF:
of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
FALSTAFF:
shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
FALSTAFF:
seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
Hostess:
O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not
Hostess:
how oft, that ring was copper!
FALSTAFF:
How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an
FALSTAFF:
he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he
FALSTAFF:
would say so.
FALSTAFF:
Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them playing on his truncheon like a life
FALSTAFF:
How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?
FALSTAFF:
must we all march?
BARDOLPH:
Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
Hostess:
My lord, I pray you, hear me.
PRINCE HENRY:
What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy
PRINCE HENRY:
husband? I love him well, he is an honest man.
Hostess:
Good my lord, hear me.
FALSTAFF:
Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.
PRINCE HENRY:
What sayest thou, Jack?
FALSTAFF:
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
FALSTAFF:
and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
FALSTAFF:
bawdy-house, they pick pockets.
PRINCE HENRY:
What didst thou lose, Jack?
FALSTAFF:
Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
FALSTAFF:
forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
FALSTAFF:
grandfather's.
PRINCE HENRY:
A trifle, some eight-penny matter.
Hostess:
So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your
Hostess:
grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
Hostess:
of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is, and said
Hostess:
he would cudgel you.
PRINCE HENRY:
What! he did not?
Hostess:
There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
FALSTAFF:
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
FALSTAFF:
prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
FALSTAFF:
fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
FALSTAFF:
deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
FALSTAFF:
go
Hostess:
Say, what thing? what thing?
FALSTAFF:
What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.
Hostess:
I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
Hostess:
shouldst know it, I am an honest man's wife: and,
Hostess:
setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
Hostess:
call me so.
FALSTAFF:
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
FALSTAFF:
otherwise.
Hostess:
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
FALSTAFF:
What beast! why, an otter.
PRINCE HENRY:
An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?
FALSTAFF:
Why, she's neither fish nor flesh, a man knows not
FALSTAFF:
where to have her.
Hostess:
Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
Hostess:
man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!
PRINCE HENRY:
Thou sayest true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly.
Hostess:
So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you
Hostess:
ought him a thousand pound.
PRINCE HENRY:
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
FALSTAFF:
A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
FALSTAFF:
a million: thou owest me thy love.
Hostess:
Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would
Hostess:
cudgel you.
FALSTAFF:
Did I, Bardolph?
BARDOLPH:
Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
FALSTAFF:
Yea, if he said my ring was copper.
PRINCE HENRY:
I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
FALSTAFF:
Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare
FALSTAFF:
but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
FALSTAFF:
roaring of a lion's whelp.
PRINCE HENRY:
And why not as the lion?
FALSTAFF:
The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
FALSTAFF:
think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
FALSTAFF:
I do, I pray God my girdle break.
PRINCE HENRY:
O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
PRINCE HENRY:
knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,
PRINCE HENRY:
truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine, it is all
PRINCE HENRY:
filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
PRINCE HENRY:
woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,
PRINCE HENRY:
impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
PRINCE HENRY:
thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
PRINCE HENRY:
bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
PRINCE HENRY:
sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
PRINCE HENRY:
were enriched with any other injuries but these, I
PRINCE HENRY:
am a villain: and yet you will stand to if, you will
PRINCE HENRY:
not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
FALSTAFF:
Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
FALSTAFF:
innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack
FALSTAFF:
Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
FALSTAFF:
have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
FALSTAFF:
frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?
PRINCE HENRY:
It appears so by the story.
FALSTAFF:
Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast,
FALSTAFF:
love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
FALSTAFF:
guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
FALSTAFF:
reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
FALSTAFF:
prithee, be gone.
FALSTAFF:
Exit Hostess
FALSTAFF:
Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,
FALSTAFF:
lad, how is that answered?
PRINCE HENRY:
O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to
PRINCE HENRY:
thee: the money is paid back again.
FALSTAFF:
O, I do not like that paying back, 'tis a double labour.
PRINCE HENRY:
I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
FALSTAFF:
Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
FALSTAFF:
do it with unwashed hands too.
BARDOLPH:
Do, my lord.
PRINCE HENRY:
I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
FALSTAFF:
I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
FALSTAFF:
one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
FALSTAFF:
age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
FALSTAFF:
heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
FALSTAFF:
these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I
FALSTAFF:
laud them, I praise them.
PRINCE HENRY:
Bardolph!
BARDOLPH:
My lord?
PRINCE HENRY:
Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my
PRINCE HENRY:
brother John, this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit Bardolph
PRINCE HENRY:
Go, Peto, to horse, to horse, for thou and I have
PRINCE HENRY:
thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit Peto
PRINCE HENRY:
Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two
PRINCE HENRY:
o'clock in the afternoon.
PRINCE HENRY:
There shalt thou know thy charge, and there receive
PRINCE HENRY:
Money and order for their furniture.
PRINCE HENRY:
The land is burning, Percy stands on high,
PRINCE HENRY:
And either we or they must lower lie.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit PRINCE HENRY
FALSTAFF:
Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
FALSTAFF:
O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
FALSTAFF:
Exit
FALSTAFF:
ACT IV
FALSTAFF:
SCENE I. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
FALSTAFF:
Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS
HOTSPUR:
Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
HOTSPUR:
In this fine age were not thought flattery,
HOTSPUR:
Such attribution should the Douglas have,
HOTSPUR:
As not a soldier of this season's stamp
HOTSPUR:
Should go so general current through the world.
HOTSPUR:
By God, I cannot flatter, I do defy
HOTSPUR:
The tongues of soothers, but a braver place
HOTSPUR:
In my heart's love hath no man than yourself
HOTSPUR:
Nay, task me to my word, approve me, lord.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Thou art the king of honour
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
No man so potent breathes upon the ground
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
But I will beard him.
HOTSPUR:
Do so, and 'tis well.
HOTSPUR:
Enter a Messenger with letters
HOTSPUR:
What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
Messenger:
These letters come from your father.
HOTSPUR:
Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
Messenger:
He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick.
HOTSPUR:
'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
HOTSPUR:
In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
HOTSPUR:
Under whose government come they along?
Messenger:
His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
Messenger:
He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,
Messenger:
And at the time of my departure thence
Messenger:
He was much fear'd by his physicians.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
I would the state of time had first been whole
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Ere he by sickness had been visited
EARL OF WORCESTER:
His health was never better worth than now.
HOTSPUR:
Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
HOTSPUR:
The very life-blood of our enterprise,
HOTSPUR:
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
HOTSPUR:
He writes me here, that inward sickness--
HOTSPUR:
And that his friends by deputation could not
HOTSPUR:
So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
HOTSPUR:
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
HOTSPUR:
On any soul removed but on his own.
HOTSPUR:
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
HOTSPUR:
That with our small conjunction we should on,
HOTSPUR:
To see how fortune is disposed to us,
HOTSPUR:
For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.
HOTSPUR:
Because the king is certainly possess'd
HOTSPUR:
Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
HOTSPUR:
A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off
HOTSPUR:
And yet, in faith, it is not, his present want
HOTSPUR:
Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
HOTSPUR:
To set the exact wealth of all our states
HOTSPUR:
All at one cast? to set so rich a main
HOTSPUR:
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
HOTSPUR:
It were not good, for therein should we read
HOTSPUR:
The very bottom and the soul of hope,
HOTSPUR:
The very list, the very utmost bound
HOTSPUR:
Of all our fortunes.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
'Faith, and so we should,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Where now remains a sweet reversion
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Is to come in
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
HOTSPUR:
A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.
HOTSPUR:
If that the devil and mischance look big
HOTSPUR:
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
But yet I would your father had been here.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The quality and hair of our attempt
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Brooks no division: it will be thought
EARL OF WORCESTER:
By some, that know not why he is away,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And think how such an apprehension
EARL OF WORCESTER:
May turn the tide of fearful faction
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And breed a kind of question in our cause,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
For well you know we of the offering side
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The eye of reason may pry in upon us
EARL OF WORCESTER:
This absence of your father's draws a curtain,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Before not dreamt of.
HOTSPUR:
You strain too far.
HOTSPUR:
I rather of his absence make this use
HOTSPUR:
It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
HOTSPUR:
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
HOTSPUR:
Than if the earl were here, for men must think,
HOTSPUR:
If we without his help can make a head
HOTSPUR:
To push against a kingdom, with his help
HOTSPUR:
We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
HOTSPUR:
Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
As heart can think: there is not such a word
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON
HOTSPUR:
My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.
VERNON:
Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
VERNON:
The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
VERNON:
Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John.
HOTSPUR:
No harm: what more?
VERNON:
And further, I have learn'd,
VERNON:
The king himself in person is set forth,
VERNON:
Or hitherwards intended speedily,
VERNON:
With strong and mighty preparation.
HOTSPUR:
He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
HOTSPUR:
The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
HOTSPUR:
And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,
HOTSPUR:
And bid it pass?
VERNON:
All furnish'd, all in arms,
VERNON:
All plumed like estridges that with the wind
VERNON:
Baited like eagles having lately bathed,
VERNON:
Glittering in golden coats, like images,
VERNON:
As full of spirit as the month of May,
VERNON:
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer,
VERNON:
Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
VERNON:
I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,
VERNON:
His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd
VERNON:
Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,
VERNON:
And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
VERNON:
As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,
VERNON:
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
VERNON:
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
HOTSPUR:
No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,
HOTSPUR:
This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come
HOTSPUR:
They come like sacrifices in their trim,
HOTSPUR:
And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
HOTSPUR:
All hot and bleeding will we offer them
HOTSPUR:
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
HOTSPUR:
Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
HOTSPUR:
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
HOTSPUR:
And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,
HOTSPUR:
Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
HOTSPUR:
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales
HOTSPUR:
Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
HOTSPUR:
Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
HOTSPUR:
O that Glendower were come!
VERNON:
There is more news
VERNON:
I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,
VERNON:
He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
WORCESTER:
Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
HOTSPUR:
What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
VERNON:
To thirty thousand.
HOTSPUR:
Forty let it be
HOTSPUR:
My father and Glendower being both away,
HOTSPUR:
The powers of us may serve so great a day
HOTSPUR:
Come, let us take a muster speedily
HOTSPUR:
Doomsday is near, die all, die merrily.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Exeunt
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
SCENE II. A public road near Coventry.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry, fill me a
FALSTAFF:
bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through,
FALSTAFF:
we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
BARDOLPH:
Will you give me money, captain?
FALSTAFF:
Lay out, lay out.
BARDOLPH:
This bottle makes an angel.
FALSTAFF:
An if it do, take it for thy labour, and if it make
FALSTAFF:
twenty, take them all, I'll answer the coinage. Bid
FALSTAFF:
my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
BARDOLPH:
I will, captain: farewell.
BARDOLPH:
Exit
FALSTAFF:
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
FALSTAFF:
gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
FALSTAFF:
I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
FALSTAFF:
soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
FALSTAFF:
none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons, inquire
FALSTAFF:
me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
FALSTAFF:
twice on the banns, such a commodity of warm slaves,
FALSTAFF:
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum, such as
FALSTAFF:
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
FALSTAFF:
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
FALSTAFF:
toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
FALSTAFF:
bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
FALSTAFF:
their services, and now my whole charge consists of
FALSTAFF:
ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
FALSTAFF:
companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
FALSTAFF:
painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
FALSTAFF:
sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
FALSTAFF:
discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
FALSTAFF:
younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
FALSTAFF:
trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
FALSTAFF:
long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
FALSTAFF:
an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
FALSTAFF:
the rooms of them that have bought out their
FALSTAFF:
services, that you would think that I had a hundred
FALSTAFF:
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
FALSTAFF:
swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
FALSTAFF:
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
FALSTAFF:
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
FALSTAFF:
hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
FALSTAFF:
Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
FALSTAFF:
villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
FALSTAFF:
gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of
FALSTAFF:
prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
FALSTAFF:
company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
FALSTAFF:
together and thrown over the shoulders like an
FALSTAFF:
herald's coat without sleeves, and the shirt, to say
FALSTAFF:
the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
FALSTAFF:
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
FALSTAFF:
one, they'll find linen enough on every hedge.
FALSTAFF:
Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND
PRINCE HENRY:
How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!
FALSTAFF:
What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
FALSTAFF:
in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
FALSTAFF:
cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
FALSTAFF:
at Shrewsbury.
WESTMORELAND:
Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were
WESTMORELAND:
there, and you too, but my powers are there already.
WESTMORELAND:
The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must
WESTMORELAND:
away all night.
FALSTAFF:
Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
FALSTAFF:
steal cream.
PRINCE HENRY:
I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath
PRINCE HENRY:
already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
PRINCE HENRY:
fellows are these that come after?
FALSTAFF:
Mine, Hal, mine.
PRINCE HENRY:
I did never see such pitiful rascals.
FALSTAFF:
Tut, tut, good enough to toss, food for powder, food
FALSTAFF:
for powder, they'll fill a pit as well as better
FALSTAFF:
tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.
WESTMORELAND:
Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor
WESTMORELAND:
and bare, too beggarly.
FALSTAFF:
'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
FALSTAFF:
that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never
FALSTAFF:
learned that of me.
PRINCE HENRY:
No I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on
PRINCE HENRY:
the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
PRINCE HENRY:
already in the field.
FALSTAFF:
What, is the king encamped?
WESTMORELAND:
He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.
FALSTAFF:
Well,
FALSTAFF:
To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
FALSTAFF:
Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.
FALSTAFF:
Exeunt
FALSTAFF:
SCENE III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
FALSTAFF:
Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON
HOTSPUR:
We'll fight with him to-night.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
It may not be.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
You give him then the advantage.
VERNON:
Not a whit.
HOTSPUR:
Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
VERNON:
So do we.
HOTSPUR:
His is certain, ours is doubtful.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Good cousin, be advised, stir not tonight.
VERNON:
Do not, my lord.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
You do not counsel well
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
VERNON:
Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,
VERNON:
And I dare well maintain it with my life,
VERNON:
If well-respected honour bid me on,
VERNON:
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
VERNON:
As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives
VERNON:
Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
VERNON:
Which of us fears.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Yea, or to-night.
VERNON:
Content.
HOTSPUR:
To-night, say I.
VERNON:
Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
VERNON:
Being men of such great leading as you are,
VERNON:
That you foresee not what impediments
VERNON:
Drag back our expedition: certain horse
VERNON:
Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up
VERNON:
Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today,
VERNON:
And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
VERNON:
Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
VERNON:
That not a horse is half the half of himself.
HOTSPUR:
So are the horses of the enemy
HOTSPUR:
In general, journey-bated and brought low
HOTSPUR:
The better part of ours are full of rest.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The number of the king exceedeth ours
EARL OF WORCESTER:
For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The trumpet sounds a parley
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
I come with gracious offers from the king,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
HOTSPUR:
Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God
HOTSPUR:
You were of our determination!
HOTSPUR:
Some of us love you well, and even those some
HOTSPUR:
Envy your great deservings and good name,
HOTSPUR:
Because you are not of our quality,
HOTSPUR:
But stand against us like an enemy.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
And God defend but still I should stand so,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
So long as out of limit and true rule
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
You stand against anointed majesty.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
You conjure from the breast of civil peace
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Audacious cruelty. If that the king
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Have any way your good deserts forgot,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Which he confesseth to be manifold,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
You shall have your desires with interest
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
And pardon absolute for yourself and these
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Herein misled by your suggestion.
HOTSPUR:
The king is kind, and well we know the king
HOTSPUR:
Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
HOTSPUR:
My father and my uncle and myself
HOTSPUR:
Did give him that same royalty he wears,
HOTSPUR:
And when he was not six and twenty strong,
HOTSPUR:
Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
HOTSPUR:
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
HOTSPUR:
My father gave him welcome to the shore,
HOTSPUR:
And when he heard him swear and vow to God
HOTSPUR:
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
HOTSPUR:
To sue his livery and beg his peace,
HOTSPUR:
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
HOTSPUR:
My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
HOTSPUR:
Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
HOTSPUR:
Now when the lords and barons of the realm
HOTSPUR:
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
HOTSPUR:
The more and less came in with cap and knee,
HOTSPUR:
Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
HOTSPUR:
Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
HOTSPUR:
Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
HOTSPUR:
Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him
HOTSPUR:
Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
HOTSPUR:
He presently, as greatness knows itself,
HOTSPUR:
Steps me a little higher than his vow
HOTSPUR:
Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
HOTSPUR:
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,
HOTSPUR:
And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
HOTSPUR:
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
HOTSPUR:
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
HOTSPUR:
Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
HOTSPUR:
Over his country's wrongs, and by this face,
HOTSPUR:
This seeming brow of justice, did he win
HOTSPUR:
The hearts of all that he did angle for,
HOTSPUR:
Proceeded further, cut me off the heads
HOTSPUR:
Of all the favourites that the absent king
HOTSPUR:
In deputation left behind him here,
HOTSPUR:
When he was personal in the Irish war.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Tut, I came not to hear this.
HOTSPUR:
Then to the point.
HOTSPUR:
In short time after, he deposed the king,
HOTSPUR:
Soon after that, deprived him of his life,
HOTSPUR:
And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state
HOTSPUR:
To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,
HOTSPUR:
Who is, if every owner were well placed,
HOTSPUR:
Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
HOTSPUR:
There without ransom to lie forfeited,
HOTSPUR:
Disgraced me in my happy victories,
HOTSPUR:
Sought to entrap me by intelligence,
HOTSPUR:
Rated mine uncle from the council-board,
HOTSPUR:
In rage dismiss'd my father from the court,
HOTSPUR:
Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
HOTSPUR:
And in conclusion drove us to seek out
HOTSPUR:
This head of safety, and withal to pry
HOTSPUR:
Into his title, the which we find
HOTSPUR:
Too indirect for long continuance.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Shall I return this answer to the king?
HOTSPUR:
Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
HOTSPUR:
Go to the king, and let there be impawn'd
HOTSPUR:
Some surety for a safe return again,
HOTSPUR:
And in the morning early shall my uncle
HOTSPUR:
Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
I would you would accept of grace and love.
HOTSPUR:
And may be so we shall.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Pray God you do.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Exeunt
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealed brief
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
With winged haste to the lord marshal,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
To whom they are directed. If you knew
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
How much they do to import, you would make haste.
SIR MICHAEL:
My good lord,
SIR MICHAEL:
I guess their tenor.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Like enough you do.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Must bide the touch, for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
As I am truly given to understand,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
The king with mighty and quick-raised power
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
What with the sickness of Northumberland,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Whose power was in the first proportion,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Who with them was a rated sinew too
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
I fear the power of Percy is too weak
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
To wage an instant trial with the king.
SIR MICHAEL:
Why, my good lord, you need not fear,
SIR MICHAEL:
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
No, Mortimer is not there.
SIR MICHAEL:
But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
SIR MICHAEL:
And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
SIR MICHAEL:
Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
The special head of all the land together
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
And moe corrivals and dear men
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Of estimation and command in arms.
SIR MICHAEL:
Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
For he hath heard of our confederacy,
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Therefore make haste. I must go write again
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
To other friends, and so farewell, Sir Michael.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Exeunt
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
ACT V
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of  LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF
KING HENRY IV:
How bloodily the sun begins to peer
KING HENRY IV:
Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
KING HENRY IV:
At his distemperature.
PRINCE HENRY:
The southern wind
PRINCE HENRY:
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
PRINCE HENRY:
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
PRINCE HENRY:
Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
KING HENRY IV:
Then with the losers let it sympathize,
KING HENRY IV:
For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
KING HENRY IV:
The trumpet sounds
KING HENRY IV:
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
KING HENRY IV:
How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
KING HENRY IV:
That you and I should meet upon such terms
KING HENRY IV:
As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
KING HENRY IV:
And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
KING HENRY IV:
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
KING HENRY IV:
This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
KING HENRY IV:
What say you to it? will you again unknit
KING HENRY IV:
This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
KING HENRY IV:
And move in that obedient orb again
KING HENRY IV:
Where you did give a fair and natural light,
KING HENRY IV:
And be no more an exhaled meteor,
KING HENRY IV:
A prodigy of fear and a portent
KING HENRY IV:
Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Hear me, my liege
EARL OF WORCESTER:
For mine own part, I could be well content
EARL OF WORCESTER:
To entertain the lag-end of my life
EARL OF WORCESTER:
With quiet hours, for I do protest,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
I have not sought the day of this dislike.
KING HENRY IV:
You have not sought it! how comes it, then?
FALSTAFF:
Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.
PRINCE HENRY:
Peace, chewet, peace!
EARL OF WORCESTER:
It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Of favour from myself and all our house,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And yet I must remember you, my lord,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
We were the first and dearest of your friends.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
For you my staff of office did I break
EARL OF WORCESTER:
In Richard's time, and posted day and night
EARL OF WORCESTER:
to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
When yet you were in place and in account
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
It was myself, my brother and his son,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
That brought you home and boldly did outdare
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster
EARL OF WORCESTER:
To this we swore our aid. But in short space
EARL OF WORCESTER:
It rain'd down fortune showering on your head,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
What with our help, what with the absent king,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
What with the injuries of a wanton time,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And the contrarious winds that held the king
EARL OF WORCESTER:
So long in his unlucky Irish wars
EARL OF WORCESTER:
That all in England did repute him dead
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And from this swarm of fair advantages
EARL OF WORCESTER:
You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
EARL OF WORCESTER:
To gripe the general sway into your hand,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And being fed by us you used us so
EARL OF WORCESTER:
As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Useth the sparrow, did oppress our nest,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
EARL OF WORCESTER:
That even our love durst not come near your sight
EARL OF WORCESTER:
For fear of swallowing, but with nimble wing
EARL OF WORCESTER:
We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Out of sight and raise this present head,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Whereby we stand opposed by such means
EARL OF WORCESTER:
As you yourself have forged against yourself
EARL OF WORCESTER:
By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And violation of all faith and troth
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
KING HENRY IV:
These things indeed you have articulate,
KING HENRY IV:
Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
KING HENRY IV:
To face the garment of rebellion
KING HENRY IV:
With some fine colour that may please the eye
KING HENRY IV:
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
KING HENRY IV:
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
KING HENRY IV:
Of hurlyburly innovation
KING HENRY IV:
And never yet did insurrection want
KING HENRY IV:
Such water-colours to impaint his cause,
KING HENRY IV:
Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
KING HENRY IV:
Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
PRINCE HENRY:
In both your armies there is many a soul
PRINCE HENRY:
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
PRINCE HENRY:
If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
PRINCE HENRY:
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
PRINCE HENRY:
In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,
PRINCE HENRY:
This present enterprise set off his head,
PRINCE HENRY:
I do not think a braver gentleman,
PRINCE HENRY:
More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
PRINCE HENRY:
More daring or more bold, is now alive
PRINCE HENRY:
To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
PRINCE HENRY:
For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
PRINCE HENRY:
I have a truant been to chivalry,
PRINCE HENRY:
And so I hear he doth account me too,
PRINCE HENRY:
Yet this before my father's majesty--
PRINCE HENRY:
I am content that he shall take the odds
PRINCE HENRY:
Of his great name and estimation,
PRINCE HENRY:
And will, to save the blood on either side,
PRINCE HENRY:
Try fortune with him in a single fight.
KING HENRY IV:
And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
KING HENRY IV:
Albeit considerations infinite
KING HENRY IV:
Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
KING HENRY IV:
We love our people well, even those we love
KING HENRY IV:
That are misled upon your cousin's part,
KING HENRY IV:
And, will they take the offer of our grace,
KING HENRY IV:
Both he and they and you, every man
KING HENRY IV:
Shall be my friend again and I'll be his
KING HENRY IV:
So tell your cousin, and bring me word
KING HENRY IV:
What he will do: but if he will not yield,
KING HENRY IV:
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
KING HENRY IV:
And they shall do their office. So, be gone,
KING HENRY IV:
We will not now be troubled with reply
KING HENRY IV:
We offer fair, take it advisedly.
KING HENRY IV:
Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON
PRINCE HENRY:
It will not be accepted, on my life
PRINCE HENRY:
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
PRINCE HENRY:
Are confident against the world in arms.
KING HENRY IV:
Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge,
KING HENRY IV:
For, on their answer, will we set on them
KING HENRY IV:
And God befriend us, as our cause is just!
KING HENRY IV:
Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF:
Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
FALSTAFF:
me, so, 'tis a point of friendship.
PRINCE HENRY:
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
PRINCE HENRY:
Say thy prayers, and farewell.
FALSTAFF:
I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.
PRINCE HENRY:
Why, thou owest God a death.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit PRINCE HENRY
FALSTAFF:
'Tis not due yet, I would be loath to pay him before
FALSTAFF:
his day. What need I be so forward with him that
FALSTAFF:
calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter, honour pricks
FALSTAFF:
me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
FALSTAFF:
come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
FALSTAFF:
an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
FALSTAFF:
Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
FALSTAFF:
honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
FALSTAFF:
is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
FALSTAFF:
he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
FALSTAFF:
Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,
FALSTAFF:
to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
FALSTAFF:
no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
FALSTAFF:
I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
FALSTAFF:
ends my catechism.
FALSTAFF:
Exit
FALSTAFF:
SCENE II. The rebel camp.
FALSTAFF:
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
EARL OF WORCESTER:
O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The liberal and kind offer of the king.
VERNON:
'Twere best he did.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Then are we all undone.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
It is not possible, it cannot be,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The king should keep his word in loving us,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
He will suspect us still and find a time
EARL OF WORCESTER:
To punish this offence in other faults
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
For treason is but trusted like the fox,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Interpretation will misquote our looks,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
My nephew's trespass may be well forgot,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And an adopted name of privilege,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen
EARL OF WORCESTER:
All his offences live upon my head
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And on his father's, we did train him on,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
In any case, the offer of the king.
VERNON:
Deliver what you will, I'll say 'tis so.
VERNON:
Here comes your cousin.
VERNON:
Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS
HOTSPUR:
My uncle is return'd
HOTSPUR:
Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
HOTSPUR:
Uncle, what news?
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The king will bid you battle presently.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
HOTSPUR:
Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Marry, and shall, and very willingly.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Exit
EARL OF WORCESTER:
There is no seeming mercy in the king.
HOTSPUR:
Did you beg any? God forbid!
EARL OF WORCESTER:
I told him gently of our grievances,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Of his oath-breaking, which he mended thus,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
By now forswearing that he is forsworn
EARL OF WORCESTER:
He calls us rebels, traitors, and will scourge
EARL OF WORCESTER:
With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Arm, gentlemen, to arms! for I have thrown
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.
HOTSPUR:
O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
HOTSPUR:
And that no man might draw short breath today
HOTSPUR:
But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
HOTSPUR:
How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?
VERNON:
No, by my soul, I never in my life
VERNON:
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
VERNON:
Unless a brother should a brother dare
VERNON:
To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
VERNON:
He gave you all the duties of a man,
VERNON:
Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,
VERNON:
Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,
VERNON:
Making you ever better than his praise
VERNON:
By still dispraising praise valued in you,
VERNON:
And, which became him like a prince indeed,
VERNON:
He made a blushing cital of himself,
VERNON:
And chid his truant youth with such a grace
VERNON:
As if he master'd there a double spirit.
VERNON:
Of teaching and of learning instantly.
VERNON:
There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
VERNON:
If he outlive the envy of this day,
VERNON:
England did never owe so sweet a hope,
VERNON:
So much misconstrued in his wantonness.
HOTSPUR:
Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
HOTSPUR:
On his follies: never did I hear
HOTSPUR:
Of any prince so wild a libertine.
HOTSPUR:
But be he as he will, yet once ere night
HOTSPUR:
I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
HOTSPUR:
That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
HOTSPUR:
Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,
HOTSPUR:
Better consider what you have to do
HOTSPUR:
Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
HOTSPUR:
Can lift your blood up with persuasion.
HOTSPUR:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
My lord, here are letters for you.
HOTSPUR:
I cannot read them now.
HOTSPUR:
O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
HOTSPUR:
To spend that shortness basely were too long,
HOTSPUR:
If life did ride upon a dial's point,
HOTSPUR:
Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
HOTSPUR:
An if we live, we live to tread on kings,
HOTSPUR:
If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
HOTSPUR:
Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
HOTSPUR:
When the intent of bearing them is just.
HOTSPUR:
Enter another Messenger
Messenger:
My lord, prepare, the king comes on apace.
HOTSPUR:
I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
HOTSPUR:
For I profess not talking, only this--
HOTSPUR:
Let each man do his best: and here draw I
HOTSPUR:
A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
HOTSPUR:
With the best blood that I can meet withal
HOTSPUR:
In the adventure of this perilous day.
HOTSPUR:
Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
HOTSPUR:
Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
HOTSPUR:
And by that music let us all embrace,
HOTSPUR:
For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall
HOTSPUR:
A second time do such a courtesy.
HOTSPUR:
The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt
HOTSPUR:
SCENE III. Plain between the camps.
HOTSPUR:
KING HENRY enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
What is thy name, that in the battle thus
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Upon my head?
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Know then, my name is Douglas,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Because some tell me that thou art a king.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
They tell thee true.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
Lord Stafford's death.
SIR WALTER BLUNT:
They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT. Enter HOTSPUR
HOTSPUR:
O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
HOTSPUR:
never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
All's done, all's won, here breathless lies the king.
HOTSPUR:
Where?
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Here.
HOTSPUR:
This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well
HOTSPUR:
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt,
HOTSPUR:
Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
HOTSPUR:
The king hath many marching in his coats.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Until I meet the king.
HOTSPUR:
Up, and away!
HOTSPUR:
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
HOTSPUR:
Exeunt
HOTSPUR:
Alarum. Enter FALSTAFF, solus
FALSTAFF:
Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear
FALSTAFF:
the shot here, here's no scoring but upon the pate.
FALSTAFF:
Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
FALSTAFF:
for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
FALSTAFF:
lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I
FALSTAFF:
need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
FALSTAFF:
led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
FALSTAFF:
not three of my hundred and fifty left alive, and
FALSTAFF:
they are for the town's end, to beg during life.
FALSTAFF:
But who comes here?
FALSTAFF:
Enter PRINCE HENRY
PRINCE HENRY:
What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword
PRINCE HENRY:
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
PRINCE HENRY:
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
PRINCE HENRY:
Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,
PRINCE HENRY:
lend me thy sword.
FALSTAFF:
O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
FALSTAFF:
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
FALSTAFF:
done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.
PRINCE HENRY:
He is, indeed, and living to kill thee. I prithee,
PRINCE HENRY:
lend me thy sword.
FALSTAFF:
Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st
FALSTAFF:
not my sword, but take my pistol, if thou wilt.
PRINCE HENRY:
Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
FALSTAFF:
Ay, Hal, 'tis hot, 'tis hot, there's that will sack a city.
FALSTAFF:
PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack
PRINCE HENRY:
What, is it a time to jest and dally now?
PRINCE HENRY:
He throws the bottle at him. Exit
FALSTAFF:
Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do
FALSTAFF:
come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his
FALSTAFF:
willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like
FALSTAFF:
not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
FALSTAFF:
life: which if I can save, so, if not, honour comes
FALSTAFF:
unlooked for, and there's an end.
FALSTAFF:
Exit FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF:
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
FALSTAFF:
Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, and EARL OF WESTMORELAND
KING HENRY IV:
I prithee,
KING HENRY IV:
Harry, withdraw thyself, thou bleed'st too much.
KING HENRY IV:
Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
LANCASTER:
Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
PRINCE HENRY:
I beseech your majesty, make up,
PRINCE HENRY:
Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
KING HENRY IV:
I will do so.
KING HENRY IV:
My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.
WESTMORELAND:
Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
PRINCE HENRY:
Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help
PRINCE HENRY:
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
PRINCE HENRY:
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
PRINCE HENRY:
Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
PRINCE HENRY:
and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
LANCASTER:
We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,
LANCASTER:
Our duty this way lies, for God's sake come.
LANCASTER:
Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND
PRINCE HENRY:
By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster,
PRINCE HENRY:
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit
PRINCE HENRY:
Before, I loved thee as a brother, John,
PRINCE HENRY:
But now, I do respect thee as my soul.
KING HENRY IV:
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
KING HENRY IV:
With lustier maintenance than I did look for
KING HENRY IV:
Of such an ungrown warrior.
PRINCE HENRY:
O, this boy
PRINCE HENRY:
Lends mettle to us all!
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit
PRINCE HENRY:
Enter DOUGLAS
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
KING HENRY IV:
The king himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart
KING HENRY IV:
So many of his shadows thou hast met
KING HENRY IV:
And not the very king. I have two boys
KING HENRY IV:
Seek Percy and thyself about the field
KING HENRY IV:
But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
KING HENRY IV:
I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
I fear thou art another counterfeit,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
And thus I win thee.
EARL OF DOUGLAS:
They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE HENRY enters
PRINCE HENRY:
Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
PRINCE HENRY:
Never to hold it up again! the spirits
PRINCE HENRY:
Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms
PRINCE HENRY:
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,
PRINCE HENRY:
Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
PRINCE HENRY:
They fight: DOUGLAS flies
PRINCE HENRY:
Cheerly, my lord	how fares your grace?
PRINCE HENRY:
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,
PRINCE HENRY:
And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.
KING HENRY IV:
Stay, and breathe awhile
KING HENRY IV:
Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,
KING HENRY IV:
And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,
KING HENRY IV:
In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
PRINCE HENRY:
O God! they did me too much injury
PRINCE HENRY:
That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
PRINCE HENRY:
If it were so, I might have let alone
PRINCE HENRY:
The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
PRINCE HENRY:
Which would have been as speedy in your end
PRINCE HENRY:
As all the poisonous potions in the world
PRINCE HENRY:
And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
KING HENRY IV:
Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
KING HENRY IV:
Exit
KING HENRY IV:
Enter HOTSPUR
HOTSPUR:
If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.
PRINCE HENRY:
Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
HOTSPUR:
My name is Harry Percy.
PRINCE HENRY:
Why, then I see
PRINCE HENRY:
A very valiant rebel of the name.
PRINCE HENRY:
I am the Prince of Wales, and think not, Percy,
PRINCE HENRY:
To share with me in glory any more
PRINCE HENRY:
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,
PRINCE HENRY:
Nor can one England brook a double reign,
PRINCE HENRY:
Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
HOTSPUR:
Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come
HOTSPUR:
To end the one of us, and would to God
HOTSPUR:
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
PRINCE HENRY:
I'll make it greater ere I part from thee,
PRINCE HENRY:
And all the budding honours on thy crest
PRINCE HENRY:
I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.
HOTSPUR:
I can no longer brook thy vanities.
HOTSPUR:
They fight
HOTSPUR:
Enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF:
Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
FALSTAFF:
boy's play here, I can tell you.
FALSTAFF:
Re-enter DOUGLAS, he fights with FALSTAFF,  who falls down as if he were dead, and exit DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls
HOTSPUR:
O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
HOTSPUR:
I better brook the loss of brittle life
HOTSPUR:
Than those proud titles thou hast won of me,
HOTSPUR:
They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh
HOTSPUR:
But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool,
HOTSPUR:
And time, that takes survey of all the world,
HOTSPUR:
Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
HOTSPUR:
But that the earthy and cold hand of death
HOTSPUR:
Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
HOTSPUR:
And food for--
HOTSPUR:
Dies
PRINCE HENRY:
For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!
PRINCE HENRY:
Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
PRINCE HENRY:
When that this body did contain a spirit,
PRINCE HENRY:
A kingdom for it was too small a bound,
PRINCE HENRY:
But now two paces of the vilest earth
PRINCE HENRY:
Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
PRINCE HENRY:
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
PRINCE HENRY:
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
PRINCE HENRY:
I should not make so dear a show of zeal
PRINCE HENRY:
But let my favours hide thy mangled face,
PRINCE HENRY:
And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
PRINCE HENRY:
For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
PRINCE HENRY:
Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
PRINCE HENRY:
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
PRINCE HENRY:
But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
PRINCE HENRY:
He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground
PRINCE HENRY:
What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
PRINCE HENRY:
Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
PRINCE HENRY:
I could have better spared a better man
PRINCE HENRY:
O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
PRINCE HENRY:
If I were much in love with vanity!
PRINCE HENRY:
Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
PRINCE HENRY:
Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
PRINCE HENRY:
Embowell'd will I see thee by and by
PRINCE HENRY:
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exit PRINCE HENRY
FALSTAFF:
[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
FALSTAFF:
I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
FALSTAFF:
to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or
FALSTAFF:
that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
FALSTAFF:
Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
FALSTAFF:
is to be a counterfeit, for he is but the
FALSTAFF:
counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man
FALSTAFF:
but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
FALSTAFF:
liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and
FALSTAFF:
perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
FALSTAFF:
valour is discretion, in the which better part I
FALSTAFF:
have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this
FALSTAFF:
gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
FALSTAFF:
should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am
FALSTAFF:
afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
FALSTAFF:
Therefore I'll make him sure, yea, and I'll swear I
FALSTAFF:
killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
FALSTAFF:
Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
FALSTAFF:
Therefore, sirrah,
FALSTAFF:
Stabbing him
FALSTAFF:
with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.
FALSTAFF:
Takes up HOTSPUR on his back
FALSTAFF:
Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER
PRINCE HENRY:
Come, brother John, full bravely hast thou flesh'd
PRINCE HENRY:
Thy maiden sword.
LANCASTER:
But, soft! whom have we here?
LANCASTER:
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
PRINCE HENRY:
I did, I saw him dead,
PRINCE HENRY:
Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
PRINCE HENRY:
thou alive?
PRINCE HENRY:
Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
PRINCE HENRY:
I prithee, speak, we will not trust our eyes
PRINCE HENRY:
Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
FALSTAFF:
No, that's certain, I am not a double man: but if I
FALSTAFF:
be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy
FALSTAFF:
Throwing the body down
FALSTAFF:
if your father will do me any honour, so, if not, let
FALSTAFF:
him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
FALSTAFF:
earl or duke, I can assure you.
PRINCE HENRY:
Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.
FALSTAFF:
Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
FALSTAFF:
lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath,
FALSTAFF:
and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
FALSTAFF:
fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
FALSTAFF:
believed, so, if not, let them that should reward
FALSTAFF:
valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
FALSTAFF:
it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
FALSTAFF:
thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
FALSTAFF:
'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.
LANCASTER:
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
PRINCE HENRY:
This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
PRINCE HENRY:
Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back
PRINCE HENRY:
For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
PRINCE HENRY:
I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
PRINCE HENRY:
A retreat is sounded
PRINCE HENRY:
The trumpet sounds retreat, the day is ours.
PRINCE HENRY:
Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
PRINCE HENRY:
To see what friends are living, who are dead.
PRINCE HENRY:
Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER
FALSTAFF:
I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
FALSTAFF:
rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
FALSTAFF:
I'll grow less, for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
FALSTAFF:
live cleanly as a nobleman should do.
FALSTAFF:
Exit
FALSTAFF:
SCENE V. Another part of the field.
FALSTAFF:
The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE  HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners
KING HENRY IV:
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
KING HENRY IV:
Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
KING HENRY IV:
Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
KING HENRY IV:
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
KING HENRY IV:
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
KING HENRY IV:
Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
KING HENRY IV:
A noble earl and many a creature else
KING HENRY IV:
Had been alive this hour,
KING HENRY IV:
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
KING HENRY IV:
Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
EARL OF WORCESTER:
What I have done my safety urged me to,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
And I embrace this fortune patiently,
EARL OF WORCESTER:
Since not to be avoided it falls on me.
KING HENRY IV:
Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too
KING HENRY IV:
Other offenders we will pause upon.
KING HENRY IV:
Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded
KING HENRY IV:
How goes the field?
PRINCE HENRY:
The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
PRINCE HENRY:
The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
PRINCE HENRY:
The noble Percy slain, and all his men
PRINCE HENRY:
Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest,
PRINCE HENRY:
And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
PRINCE HENRY:
That the pursuers took him. At my tent
PRINCE HENRY:
The Douglas is, and I beseech your grace
PRINCE HENRY:
I may dispose of him.
KING HENRY IV:
With all my heart.
PRINCE HENRY:
Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
PRINCE HENRY:
This honourable bounty shall belong
PRINCE HENRY:
Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
PRINCE HENRY:
Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free
PRINCE HENRY:
His valour shown upon our crests to-day
PRINCE HENRY:
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
PRINCE HENRY:
Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
LANCASTER:
I thank your grace for this high courtesy,
LANCASTER:
Which I shall give away immediately.
KING HENRY IV:
Then this remains, that we divide our power.
KING HENRY IV:
You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland
KING HENRY IV:
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
KING HENRY IV:
To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
KING HENRY IV:
Who, as we hear, are busily in arms
KING HENRY IV:
Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
KING HENRY IV:
To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
KING HENRY IV:
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
KING HENRY IV:
Meeting the cheque of such another day
KING HENRY IV:
And since this business so fair is done,
KING HENRY IV:
Let us not leave till all our own be won.
KING HENRY IV:
Exeunt
