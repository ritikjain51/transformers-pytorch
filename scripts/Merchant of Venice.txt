DUKE VINCENTIO:
ACT I
DUKE VINCENTIO:
SCENE I. Venice. A street.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO
ANTONIO:
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad
ANTONIO:
It wearies me, you say it wearies you,
ANTONIO:
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
ANTONIO:
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
ANTONIO:
I am to learn,
ANTONIO:
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
ANTONIO:
That I have much ado to know myself.
SALARINO:
Your mind is tossing on the ocean,
SALARINO:
There, where your argosies with portly sail,
SALARINO:
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
SALARINO:
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
SALARINO:
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
SALARINO:
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
SALARINO:
As they fly by them with their woven wings.
SALANIO:
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
SALANIO:
The better part of my affections would
SALANIO:
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
SALANIO:
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
SALANIO:
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads,
SALANIO:
And every object that might make me fear
SALANIO:
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
SALANIO:
Would make me sad.
SALARINO:
My wind cooling my broth
SALARINO:
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
SALARINO:
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
SALARINO:
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
SALARINO:
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
SALARINO:
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
SALARINO:
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
SALARINO:
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
SALARINO:
And see the holy edifice of stone,
SALARINO:
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
SALARINO:
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
SALARINO:
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
SALARINO:
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
SALARINO:
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
SALARINO:
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
SALARINO:
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
SALARINO:
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
SALARINO:
But tell not me, I know, Antonio
SALARINO:
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
ANTONIO:
Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
ANTONIO:
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
ANTONIO:
Nor to one place, nor is my whole estate
ANTONIO:
Upon the fortune of this present year
ANTONIO:
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
SALARINO:
Why, then you are in love.
ANTONIO:
Fie, fie!
SALARINO:
Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
SALARINO:
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
SALARINO:
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
SALARINO:
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
SALARINO:
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time
SALARINO:
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
SALARINO:
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
SALARINO:
And other of such vinegar aspect
SALARINO:
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
SALARINO:
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
SALARINO:
Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO
SALANIO:
Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
SALANIO:
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well
SALANIO:
We leave you now with better company.
SALARINO:
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
SALARINO:
If worthier friends had not prevented me.
ANTONIO:
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
ANTONIO:
I take it, your own business calls on you
ANTONIO:
And you embrace the occasion to depart.
SALARINO:
Good morrow, my good lords.
BASSANIO:
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
BASSANIO:
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
SALARINO:
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
SALARINO:
Exeunt Salarino and Salanio
LORENZO:
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
LORENZO:
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
LORENZO:
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
BASSANIO:
I will not fail you.
GRATIANO:
You look not well, Signior Antonio,
GRATIANO:
You have too much respect upon the world
GRATIANO:
They lose it that do buy it with much care
GRATIANO:
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
ANTONIO:
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,
ANTONIO:
A stage where every man must play a part,
ANTONIO:
And mine a sad one.
GRATIANO:
Let me play the fool
GRATIANO:
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
GRATIANO:
And let my liver rather heat with wine
GRATIANO:
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
GRATIANO:
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
GRATIANO:
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
GRATIANO:
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
GRATIANO:
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
GRATIANO:
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
GRATIANO:
There are a sort of men whose visages
GRATIANO:
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
GRATIANO:
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
GRATIANO:
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
GRATIANO:
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
GRATIANO:
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
GRATIANO:
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
GRATIANO:
O my Antonio, I do know of these
GRATIANO:
That therefore only are reputed wise
GRATIANO:
For saying nothing, when, I am very sure,
GRATIANO:
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
GRATIANO:
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
GRATIANO:
I'll tell thee more of this another time
GRATIANO:
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
GRATIANO:
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
GRATIANO:
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile
GRATIANO:
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
LORENZO:
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time
LORENZO:
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
LORENZO:
For Gratiano never lets me speak.
GRATIANO:
Well, keep me company but two years moe,
GRATIANO:
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
ANTONIO:
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
GRATIANO:
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
GRATIANO:
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
GRATIANO:
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO
ANTONIO:
Is that any thing now?
BASSANIO:
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
BASSANIO:
than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
BASSANIO:
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
BASSANIO:
shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
BASSANIO:
have them, they are not worth the search.
ANTONIO:
Well, tell me now what lady is the same
ANTONIO:
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
ANTONIO:
That you to-day promised to tell me of?
BASSANIO:
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
BASSANIO:
How much I have disabled mine estate,
BASSANIO:
By something showing a more swelling port
BASSANIO:
Than my faint means would grant continuance
BASSANIO:
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
BASSANIO:
From such a noble rate, but my chief care
BASSANIO:
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
BASSANIO:
Wherein my time something too prodigal
BASSANIO:
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
BASSANIO:
I owe the most, in money and in love,
BASSANIO:
And from your love I have a warranty
BASSANIO:
To unburden all my plots and purposes
BASSANIO:
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
ANTONIO:
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it,
ANTONIO:
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
ANTONIO:
Within the eye of honour, be assured,
ANTONIO:
My purse, my person, my extremest means,
ANTONIO:
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
BASSANIO:
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
BASSANIO:
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
BASSANIO:
The self-same way with more advised watch,
BASSANIO:
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
BASSANIO:
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
BASSANIO:
Because what follows is pure innocence.
BASSANIO:
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
BASSANIO:
That which I owe is lost, but if you please
BASSANIO:
To shoot another arrow that self way
BASSANIO:
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
BASSANIO:
As I will watch the aim, or to find both
BASSANIO:
Or bring your latter hazard back again
BASSANIO:
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
ANTONIO:
You know me well, and herein spend but time
ANTONIO:
To wind about my love with circumstance,
ANTONIO:
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
ANTONIO:
In making question of my uttermost
ANTONIO:
Than if you had made waste of all I have
ANTONIO:
Then do but say to me what I should do
ANTONIO:
That in your knowledge may by me be done,
ANTONIO:
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
BASSANIO:
In Belmont is a lady richly left,
BASSANIO:
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
BASSANIO:
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
BASSANIO:
I did receive fair speechless messages
BASSANIO:
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
BASSANIO:
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia
BASSANIO:
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
BASSANIO:
For the four winds blow in from every coast
BASSANIO:
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
BASSANIO:
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
BASSANIO:
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
BASSANIO:
And many Jasons come in quest of her.
BASSANIO:
O my Antonio, had I but the means
BASSANIO:
To hold a rival place with one of them,
BASSANIO:
I have a mind presages me such thrift,
BASSANIO:
That I should questionless be fortunate!
ANTONIO:
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea,
ANTONIO:
Neither have I money nor commodity
ANTONIO:
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth,
ANTONIO:
Try what my credit can in Venice do
ANTONIO:
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
ANTONIO:
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
ANTONIO:
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
ANTONIO:
Where money is, and I no question make
ANTONIO:
To have it of my trust or for my sake.
ANTONIO:
Exeunt
ANTONIO:
SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
ANTONIO:
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
PORTIA:
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
PORTIA:
this great world.
NERISSA:
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
NERISSA:
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
NERISSA:
yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
NERISSA:
with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
NERISSA:
is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
NERISSA:
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
NERISSA:
competency lives longer.
PORTIA:
Good sentences and well pronounced.
NERISSA:
They would be better, if well followed.
PORTIA:
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
PORTIA:
do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
PORTIA:
cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
PORTIA:
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
PORTIA:
twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
PORTIA:
twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
PORTIA:
devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
PORTIA:
o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
PORTIA:
youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
PORTIA:
cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
PORTIA:
choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
PORTIA:
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
PORTIA:
dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curbed
PORTIA:
by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
PORTIA:
Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
NERISSA:
Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their
NERISSA:
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
NERISSA:
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
NERISSA:
silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
NERISSA:
chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
NERISSA:
rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
NERISSA:
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
NERISSA:
these princely suitors that are already come?
PORTIA:
I pray thee, over-name them, and as thou namest
PORTIA:
them, I will describe them, and, according to my
PORTIA:
description, level at my affection.
NERISSA:
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
PORTIA:
Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
PORTIA:
talk of his horse, and he makes it a great
PORTIA:
appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
PORTIA:
shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
PORTIA:
mother played false with a smith.
NERISSA:
Then there is the County Palatine.
PORTIA:
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
PORTIA:
will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
PORTIA:
smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
PORTIA:
philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
PORTIA:
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
PORTIA:
married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
PORTIA:
than to either of these. God defend me from these
PORTIA:
two!
NERISSA:
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
PORTIA:
God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
PORTIA:
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
PORTIA:
he! why, he hath a horse better than the
PORTIA:
Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
PORTIA:
the Count Palatine, he is every man in no man, if a
PORTIA:
throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
PORTIA:
fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
PORTIA:
should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
PORTIA:
I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
PORTIA:
shall never requite him.
NERISSA:
What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
NERISSA:
of England?
PORTIA:
You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
PORTIA:
not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
PORTIA:
nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
PORTIA:
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
PORTIA:
He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
PORTIA:
converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
PORTIA:
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
PORTIA:
hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
PORTIA:
behavior every where.
NERISSA:
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
PORTIA:
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
PORTIA:
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
PORTIA:
swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
PORTIA:
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
PORTIA:
under for another.
NERISSA:
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
PORTIA:
Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
PORTIA:
most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
PORTIA:
he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
PORTIA:
when he is worst, he is little better than a beast
PORTIA:
and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
PORTIA:
make shift to go without him.
NERISSA:
If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
NERISSA:
casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
NERISSA:
will, if you should refuse to accept him.
PORTIA:
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
PORTIA:
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
PORTIA:
for if the devil be within and that temptation
PORTIA:
without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
PORTIA:
thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
NERISSA:
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
NERISSA:
lords: they have acquainted me with their
NERISSA:
determinations, which is, indeed, to return to their
NERISSA:
home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
NERISSA:
you may be won by some other sort than your father's
NERISSA:
imposition depending on the caskets.
PORTIA:
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
PORTIA:
chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
PORTIA:
of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
PORTIA:
are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
PORTIA:
but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
PORTIA:
them a fair departure.
NERISSA:
Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
NERISSA:
Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
NERISSA:
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
PORTIA:
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, he was so called.
NERISSA:
True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
NERISSA:
eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
PORTIA:
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
PORTIA:
thy praise.
PORTIA:
Enter a Serving-man
PORTIA:
How now! what news?
Servant:
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
Servant:
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
Servant:
fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
Servant:
prince his master will be here to-night.
PORTIA:
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
PORTIA:
heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
PORTIA:
be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
PORTIA:
of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
PORTIA:
rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
PORTIA:
Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
PORTIA:
Whiles we shut the gates
PORTIA:
upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.
PORTIA:
Exeunt
PORTIA:
SCENE III. Venice. A public place.
PORTIA:
Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK
SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats, well.
BASSANIO:
Ay, sir, for three months.
SHYLOCK:
For three months, well.
BASSANIO:
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
SHYLOCK:
Antonio shall become bound, well.
BASSANIO:
May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
BASSANIO:
know your answer?
SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
BASSANIO:
Your answer to that.
SHYLOCK:
Antonio is a good man.
BASSANIO:
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
SHYLOCK:
Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
SHYLOCK:
good man is to have you understand me that he is
SHYLOCK:
sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
SHYLOCK:
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
SHYLOCK:
Indies, I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
SHYLOCK:
hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
SHYLOCK:
other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
SHYLOCK:
are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
SHYLOCK:
and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
SHYLOCK:
mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
SHYLOCK:
winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
SHYLOCK:
sufficient. Three thousand ducats, I think I may
SHYLOCK:
take his bond.
BASSANIO:
Be assured you may.
SHYLOCK:
I will be assured I may, and, that I may be assured,
SHYLOCK:
I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
BASSANIO:
If it please you to dine with us.
SHYLOCK:
Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which
SHYLOCK:
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
SHYLOCK:
will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
SHYLOCK:
walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
SHYLOCK:
with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
SHYLOCK:
news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
SHYLOCK:
Enter ANTONIO
BASSANIO:
This is Signior Antonio.
SHYLOCK:
[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
SHYLOCK:
I hate him for he is a Christian,
SHYLOCK:
But more for that in low simplicity
SHYLOCK:
He lends out money gratis and brings down
SHYLOCK:
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
SHYLOCK:
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
SHYLOCK:
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
SHYLOCK:
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
SHYLOCK:
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
SHYLOCK:
On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
SHYLOCK:
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
SHYLOCK:
If I forgive him!
BASSANIO:
Shylock, do you hear?
SHYLOCK:
I am debating of my present store,
SHYLOCK:
And, by the near guess of my memory,
SHYLOCK:
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
SHYLOCK:
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
SHYLOCK:
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
SHYLOCK:
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
SHYLOCK:
Do you desire?
SHYLOCK:
To ANTONIO
SHYLOCK:
Rest you fair, good signior,
SHYLOCK:
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
ANTONIO:
Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
ANTONIO:
By taking nor by giving of excess,
ANTONIO:
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
ANTONIO:
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
ANTONIO:
How much ye would?
SHYLOCK:
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
ANTONIO:
And for three months.
SHYLOCK:
I had forgot, three months, you told me so.
SHYLOCK:
Well then, your bond, and let me see, but hear you,
SHYLOCK:
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
SHYLOCK:
Upon advantage.
ANTONIO:
I do never use it.
SHYLOCK:
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
SHYLOCK:
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
SHYLOCK:
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
SHYLOCK:
The third possessor, ay, he was the third--
ANTONIO:
And what of him? did he take interest?
SHYLOCK:
No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
SHYLOCK:
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
SHYLOCK:
When Laban and himself were compromised
SHYLOCK:
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
SHYLOCK:
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
SHYLOCK:
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
SHYLOCK:
And, when the work of generation was
SHYLOCK:
Between these woolly breeders in the act,
SHYLOCK:
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
SHYLOCK:
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
SHYLOCK:
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
SHYLOCK:
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
SHYLOCK:
Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
SHYLOCK:
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest
SHYLOCK:
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
ANTONIO:
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for,
ANTONIO:
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
ANTONIO:
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
ANTONIO:
Was this inserted to make interest good?
ANTONIO:
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
SHYLOCK:
I cannot tell, I make it breed as fast
SHYLOCK:
But note me, signior.
ANTONIO:
Mark you this, Bassanio,
ANTONIO:
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
ANTONIO:
An evil soul producing holy witness
ANTONIO:
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
ANTONIO:
A goodly apple rotten at the heart
ANTONIO:
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats, 'tis a good round sum.
SHYLOCK:
Three months from twelve, then, let me see, the rate--
ANTONIO:
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
SHYLOCK:
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
SHYLOCK:
In the Rialto you have rated me
SHYLOCK:
About my moneys and my usances
SHYLOCK:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
SHYLOCK:
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
SHYLOCK:
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
SHYLOCK:
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
SHYLOCK:
And all for use of that which is mine own.
SHYLOCK:
Well then, it now appears you need my help
SHYLOCK:
Go to, then, you come to me, and you say
SHYLOCK:
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so,
SHYLOCK:
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
SHYLOCK:
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
SHYLOCK:
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
SHYLOCK:
What should I say to you? Should I not say
SHYLOCK:
'Hath a dog money? is it possible
SHYLOCK:
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
SHYLOCK:
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
SHYLOCK:
With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this,
SHYLOCK:
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last,
SHYLOCK:
You spurn'd me such a day, another time
SHYLOCK:
You call'd me dog, and for these courtesies
SHYLOCK:
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
ANTONIO:
I am as like to call thee so again,
ANTONIO:
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
ANTONIO:
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
ANTONIO:
As to thy friends, for when did friendship take
ANTONIO:
A breed for barren metal of his friend?
ANTONIO:
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
ANTONIO:
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
ANTONIO:
Exact the penalty.
SHYLOCK:
Why, look you, how you storm!
SHYLOCK:
I would be friends with you and have your love,
SHYLOCK:
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
SHYLOCK:
Supply your present wants and take no doit
SHYLOCK:
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me
SHYLOCK:
This is kind I offer.
BASSANIO:
This were kindness.
SHYLOCK:
This kindness will I show.
SHYLOCK:
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
SHYLOCK:
Your single bond, and, in a merry sport,
SHYLOCK:
If you repay me not on such a day,
SHYLOCK:
In such a place, such sum or sums as are
SHYLOCK:
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
SHYLOCK:
Be nominated for an equal pound
SHYLOCK:
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
SHYLOCK:
In what part of your body pleaseth me.
ANTONIO:
Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
ANTONIO:
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
BASSANIO:
You shall not seal to such a bond for me
BASSANIO:
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
ANTONIO:
Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it
ANTONIO:
Within these two months, that's a month before
ANTONIO:
This bond expires, I do expect return
ANTONIO:
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
SHYLOCK:
O father Abram, what these Christians are,
SHYLOCK:
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
SHYLOCK:
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this,
SHYLOCK:
If he should break his day, what should I gain
SHYLOCK:
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
SHYLOCK:
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
SHYLOCK:
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
SHYLOCK:
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
SHYLOCK:
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship
SHYLOCK:
If he will take it, so, if not, adieu,
SHYLOCK:
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
ANTONIO:
Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
SHYLOCK:
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's,
SHYLOCK:
Give him direction for this merry bond,
SHYLOCK:
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
SHYLOCK:
See to my house, left in the fearful guard
SHYLOCK:
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
SHYLOCK:
I will be with you.
ANTONIO:
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
ANTONIO:
Exit Shylock
ANTONIO:
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
BASSANIO:
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
ANTONIO:
Come on: in this there can be no dismay,
ANTONIO:
My ships come home a month before the day.
ANTONIO:
Exeunt
ANTONIO:
ACT II
ANTONIO:
SCENE I. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
ANTONIO:
Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO  and his train, PORTIA, NERISSA, and others attending
MOROCCO:
Mislike me not for my complexion,
MOROCCO:
The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
MOROCCO:
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
MOROCCO:
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
MOROCCO:
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
MOROCCO:
And let us make incision for your love,
MOROCCO:
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
MOROCCO:
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
MOROCCO:
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
MOROCCO:
The best-regarded virgins of our clime
MOROCCO:
Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
MOROCCO:
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
PORTIA:
In terms of choice I am not solely led
PORTIA:
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes,
PORTIA:
Besides, the lottery of my destiny
PORTIA:
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing
PORTIA:
But if my father had not scanted me
PORTIA:
And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
PORTIA:
His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
PORTIA:
Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
PORTIA:
As any comer I have look'd on yet
PORTIA:
For my affection.
MOROCCO:
Even for that I thank you
MOROCCO:
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
MOROCCO:
To try my fortune. By this scimitar
MOROCCO:
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
MOROCCO:
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
MOROCCO:
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
MOROCCO:
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
MOROCCO:
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
MOROCCO:
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
MOROCCO:
To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
MOROCCO:
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
MOROCCO:
Which is the better man, the greater throw
MOROCCO:
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand
MOROCCO:
So is Alcides beaten by his page,
MOROCCO:
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
MOROCCO:
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
MOROCCO:
And die with grieving.
PORTIA:
You must take your chance,
PORTIA:
And either not attempt to choose at all
PORTIA:
Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
PORTIA:
Never to speak to lady afterward
PORTIA:
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
MOROCCO:
Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
PORTIA:
First, forward to the temple: after dinner
PORTIA:
Your hazard shall be made.
MOROCCO:
Good fortune then!
MOROCCO:
To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
MOROCCO:
Cornets, and exeunt
MOROCCO:
SCENE II. Venice. A street.
MOROCCO:
Enter LAUNCELOT
LAUNCELOT:
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
LAUNCELOT:
this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
LAUNCELOT:
tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
LAUNCELOT:
Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
LAUNCELOT:
Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
LAUNCELOT:
conscience says 'No, take heed,' honest Launcelot,
LAUNCELOT:
take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
LAUNCELOT:
Launcelot Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy
LAUNCELOT:
heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
LAUNCELOT:
pack: 'Via!' says the fiend, 'away!' says the
LAUNCELOT:
fiend, 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
LAUNCELOT:
says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
LAUNCELOT:
hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
LAUNCELOT:
to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
LAUNCELOT:
man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son, for,
LAUNCELOT:
indeed, my father did something smack, something
LAUNCELOT:
grow to, he had a kind of taste, well, my conscience
LAUNCELOT:
says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
LAUNCELOT:
fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
LAUNCELOT:
'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well,' ' Fiend,'
LAUNCELOT:
say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
LAUNCELOT:
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
LAUNCELOT:
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil, and, to
LAUNCELOT:
run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
LAUNCELOT:
fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
LAUNCELOT:
himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
LAUNCELOT:
incarnal, and, in my conscience, my conscience is
LAUNCELOT:
but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
LAUNCELOT:
me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
LAUNCELOT:
friendly counsel: I will run, fiend, my heels are
LAUNCELOT:
at your command, I will run.
LAUNCELOT:
Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket
GOBBO:
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way
GOBBO:
to master Jew's?
LAUNCELOT:
[Aside]  O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!
LAUNCELOT:
who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,
LAUNCELOT:
knows me not: I will try confusions with him.
GOBBO:
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way
GOBBO:
to master Jew's?
LAUNCELOT:
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
LAUNCELOT:
at the next turning of all, on your left, marry, at
LAUNCELOT:
the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
LAUNCELOT:
down indirectly to the Jew's house.
GOBBO:
By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
GOBBO:
you tell me whether one Launcelot,
GOBBO:
that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
LAUNCELOT:
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
LAUNCELOT:
Aside
LAUNCELOT:
Mark me now, now will I raise the waters. Talk you
LAUNCELOT:
of young Master Launcelot?
GOBBO:
No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
GOBBO:
though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
GOBBO:
and, God be thanked, well to live.
LAUNCELOT:
Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
LAUNCELOT:
young Master Launcelot.
GOBBO:
Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.
LAUNCELOT:
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
LAUNCELOT:
talk you of young Master Launcelot?
GOBBO:
Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
LAUNCELOT:
Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
LAUNCELOT:
Launcelot, father, for the young gentleman,
LAUNCELOT:
according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
LAUNCELOT:
sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
LAUNCELOT:
learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
LAUNCELOT:
in plain terms, gone to heaven.
GOBBO:
Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
GOBBO:
age, my very prop.
LAUNCELOT:
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
LAUNCELOT:
a prop? Do you know me, father?
GOBBO:
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman
GOBBO:
but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
GOBBO:
soul, alive or dead?
LAUNCELOT:
Do you not know me, father?
GOBBO:
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.
LAUNCELOT:
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
LAUNCELOT:
the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
LAUNCELOT:
own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
LAUNCELOT:
your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
LAUNCELOT:
to light, murder cannot be hid long, a man's son
LAUNCELOT:
may, but at the length truth will out.
GOBBO:
Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not
GOBBO:
Launcelot, my boy.
LAUNCELOT:
Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
LAUNCELOT:
give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy
LAUNCELOT:
that was, your son that is, your child that shall
LAUNCELOT:
be.
GOBBO:
I cannot think you are my son.
LAUNCELOT:
I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
LAUNCELOT:
Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your
LAUNCELOT:
wife is my mother.
GOBBO:
Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou
GOBBO:
be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
GOBBO:
Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
GOBBO:
got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
GOBBO:
Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
LAUNCELOT:
It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
LAUNCELOT:
backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
LAUNCELOT:
than I have of my face when I last saw him.
GOBBO:
Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy
GOBBO:
master agree? I have brought him a present. How
GOBBO:
'gree you now?
LAUNCELOT:
Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set
LAUNCELOT:
up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
LAUNCELOT:
have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
LAUNCELOT:
him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
LAUNCELOT:
his service, you may tell every finger I have with
LAUNCELOT:
my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
LAUNCELOT:
your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
LAUNCELOT:
gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
LAUNCELOT:
will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
LAUNCELOT:
fortune! here comes the man: to him, father, for I
LAUNCELOT:
am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
LAUNCELOT:
Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers
BASSANIO:
You may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper
BASSANIO:
be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
BASSANIO:
these letters delivered, put the liveries to making,
BASSANIO:
and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
BASSANIO:
Exit a Servant
LAUNCELOT:
To him, father.
GOBBO:
God bless your worship!
BASSANIO:
Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?
GOBBO:
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--
LAUNCELOT:
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that
LAUNCELOT:
would, sir, as my father shall specify--
GOBBO:
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--
LAUNCELOT:
Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
LAUNCELOT:
and have a desire, as my father shall specify--
GOBBO:
His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
GOBBO:
are scarce cater-cousins--
LAUNCELOT:
To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having
LAUNCELOT:
done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I
LAUNCELOT:
hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--
GOBBO:
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
GOBBO:
your worship, and my suit is--
LAUNCELOT:
In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
LAUNCELOT:
your worship shall know by this honest old man, and,
LAUNCELOT:
though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
BASSANIO:
One speak for both. What would you?
LAUNCELOT:
Serve you, sir.
GOBBO:
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
BASSANIO:
I know thee well, thou hast obtain'd thy suit
BASSANIO:
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
BASSANIO:
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
BASSANIO:
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
BASSANIO:
The follower of so poor a gentleman.
LAUNCELOT:
The old proverb is very well parted between my
LAUNCELOT:
master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of
LAUNCELOT:
God, sir, and he hath enough.
BASSANIO:
Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
BASSANIO:
Take leave of thy old master and inquire
BASSANIO:
My lodging out. Give him a livery
BASSANIO:
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.
LAUNCELOT:
Father, in. I cannot get a service, no, I have
LAUNCELOT:
ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
LAUNCELOT:
Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
LAUNCELOT:
upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
LAUNCELOT:
here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
LAUNCELOT:
of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
LAUNCELOT:
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
LAUNCELOT:
man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be
LAUNCELOT:
in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed,
LAUNCELOT:
here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
LAUNCELOT:
woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
LAUNCELOT:
come, I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
LAUNCELOT:
Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo
BASSANIO:
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this
BASSANIO:
These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
BASSANIO:
Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
BASSANIO:
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.
LEONARDO:
My best endeavours shall be done herein.
LEONARDO:
Enter GRATIANO
GRATIANO:
Where is your master?
LEONARDO:
Yonder, sir, he walks.
LEONARDO:
Exit
GRATIANO:
Signior Bassanio!
BASSANIO:
Gratiano!
GRATIANO:
I have a suit to you.
BASSANIO:
You have obtain'd it.
GRATIANO:
You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
BASSANIO:
Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano,
BASSANIO:
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice,
BASSANIO:
Parts that become thee happily enough
BASSANIO:
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults,
BASSANIO:
But where thou art not known, why, there they show
BASSANIO:
Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
BASSANIO:
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
BASSANIO:
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
BASSANIO:
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
BASSANIO:
And lose my hopes.
GRATIANO:
Signior Bassanio, hear me
GRATIANO:
If I do not put on a sober habit,
GRATIANO:
Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
GRATIANO:
Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
GRATIANO:
Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
GRATIANO:
Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
GRATIANO:
Use all the observance of civility,
GRATIANO:
Like one well studied in a sad ostent
GRATIANO:
To please his grandam, never trust me more.
BASSANIO:
Well, we shall see your bearing.
GRATIANO:
Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
GRATIANO:
By what we do to-night.
BASSANIO:
No, that were pity
BASSANIO:
I would entreat you rather to put on
BASSANIO:
Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
BASSANIO:
That purpose merriment. But fare you well
BASSANIO:
I have some business.
GRATIANO:
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest
GRATIANO:
But we will visit you at supper-time.
GRATIANO:
Exeunt
GRATIANO:
SCENE III. The same. A room in SHYLOCK'S house.
GRATIANO:
Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT
JESSICA:
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so
JESSICA:
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
JESSICA:
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
JESSICA:
But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee
JESSICA:
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
JESSICA:
Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest
JESSICA:
Give him this letter, do it secretly,
JESSICA:
And so farewell: I would not have my father
JESSICA:
See me in talk with thee.
LAUNCELOT:
Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
LAUNCELOT:
pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play
LAUNCELOT:
the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,
LAUNCELOT:
adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
LAUNCELOT:
manly spirit: adieu.
JESSICA:
Farewell, good Launcelot.
JESSICA:
Exit Launcelot
JESSICA:
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
JESSICA:
To be ashamed to be my father's child!
JESSICA:
But though I am a daughter to his blood,
JESSICA:
I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
JESSICA:
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
JESSICA:
Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
JESSICA:
Exit
JESSICA:
SCENE IV. The same. A street.
JESSICA:
Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SALANIO
LORENZO:
Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
LORENZO:
Disguise us at my lodging and return,
LORENZO:
All in an hour.
GRATIANO:
We have not made good preparation.
SALARINO:
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
SALANIO:
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
SALANIO:
And better in my mind not undertook.
LORENZO:
'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
LORENZO:
To furnish us.
LORENZO:
Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter
LORENZO:
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
LAUNCELOT:
An it shall please you to break up
LAUNCELOT:
this, it shall seem to signify.
LORENZO:
I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand,
LORENZO:
And whiter than the paper it writ on
LORENZO:
Is the fair hand that writ.
GRATIANO:
Love-news, in faith.
LAUNCELOT:
By your leave, sir.
LORENZO:
Whither goest thou?
LAUNCELOT:
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
LAUNCELOT:
Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
LORENZO:
Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
LORENZO:
I will not fail her, speak it privately.
LORENZO:
Go, gentlemen,
LORENZO:
Exit Launcelot
LORENZO:
Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
LORENZO:
I am provided of a torch-bearer.
SALANIO:
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
SALANIO:
And so will I.
LORENZO:
Meet me and Gratiano
LORENZO:
At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
SALARINO:
'Tis good we do so.
SALARINO:
Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO
GRATIANO:
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
LORENZO:
I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
LORENZO:
How I shall take her from her father's house,
LORENZO:
What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
LORENZO:
What page's suit she hath in readiness.
LORENZO:
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
LORENZO:
It will be for his gentle daughter's sake
LORENZO:
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
LORENZO:
Unless she do it under this excuse,
LORENZO:
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
LORENZO:
Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest
LORENZO:
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.
LORENZO:
Exeunt
LORENZO:
SCENE V. The same. Before SHYLOCK'S house.
LORENZO:
Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT
SHYLOCK:
Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
SHYLOCK:
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
SHYLOCK:
What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
SHYLOCK:
As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
SHYLOCK:
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out,--
SHYLOCK:
Why, Jessica, I say!
LAUNCELOT:
Why, Jessica!
SHYLOCK:
Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
LAUNCELOT:
Your worship was wont to tell me that
LAUNCELOT:
I could do nothing without bidding.
LAUNCELOT:
Enter Jessica
JESSICA:
Call you? what is your will?
SHYLOCK:
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica
SHYLOCK:
There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
SHYLOCK:
I am not bid for love, they flatter me
SHYLOCK:
But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
SHYLOCK:
The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
SHYLOCK:
Look to my house. I am right loath to go
SHYLOCK:
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
SHYLOCK:
For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
LAUNCELOT:
I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
LAUNCELOT:
your reproach.
SHYLOCK:
So do I his.
LAUNCELOT:
An they have conspired together, I will not say you
LAUNCELOT:
shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not
LAUNCELOT:
for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
LAUNCELOT:
Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
LAUNCELOT:
falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
LAUNCELOT:
year, in the afternoon.
SHYLOCK:
What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica
SHYLOCK:
Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum
SHYLOCK:
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
SHYLOCK:
Clamber not you up to the casements then,
SHYLOCK:
Nor thrust your head into the public street
SHYLOCK:
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
SHYLOCK:
But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements
SHYLOCK:
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
SHYLOCK:
My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
SHYLOCK:
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night
SHYLOCK:
But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah,
SHYLOCK:
Say I will come.
LAUNCELOT:
I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
LAUNCELOT:
window, for all this, There will come a Christian
LAUNCELOT:
boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.
LAUNCELOT:
Exit
SHYLOCK:
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
JESSICA:
His words were 'Farewell mistress,' nothing else.
SHYLOCK:
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,
SHYLOCK:
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
SHYLOCK:
More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me,
SHYLOCK:
Therefore I part with him, and part with him
SHYLOCK:
To one that would have him help to waste
SHYLOCK:
His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in,
SHYLOCK:
Perhaps I will return immediately
SHYLOCK:
Do as I bid you, shut doors after you
SHYLOCK:
Fast bind, fast find,
SHYLOCK:
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
SHYLOCK:
Exit
JESSICA:
Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost,
JESSICA:
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
JESSICA:
Exit
JESSICA:
SCENE VI. The same.
JESSICA:
Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued
GRATIANO:
This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
GRATIANO:
Desired us to make stand.
SALARINO:
His hour is almost past.
GRATIANO:
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
GRATIANO:
For lovers ever run before the clock.
SALARINO:
O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
SALARINO:
To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
SALARINO:
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
GRATIANO:
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
GRATIANO:
With that keen appetite that he sits down?
GRATIANO:
Where is the horse that doth untread again
GRATIANO:
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
GRATIANO:
That he did pace them first? All things that are,
GRATIANO:
Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
GRATIANO:
How like a younker or a prodigal
GRATIANO:
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
GRATIANO:
Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
GRATIANO:
How like the prodigal doth she return,
GRATIANO:
With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
GRATIANO:
Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
SALARINO:
Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
SALARINO:
Enter LORENZO
LORENZO:
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode,
LORENZO:
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait
LORENZO:
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
LORENZO:
I'll watch as long for you then. Approach,
LORENZO:
Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
LORENZO:
Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes
JESSICA:
Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
JESSICA:
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
LORENZO:
Lorenzo, and thy love.
JESSICA:
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
JESSICA:
For who love I so much? And now who knows
JESSICA:
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
LORENZO:
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
JESSICA:
Here, catch this casket, it is worth the pains.
JESSICA:
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
JESSICA:
For I am much ashamed of my exchange
JESSICA:
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
JESSICA:
The pretty follies that themselves commit,
JESSICA:
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
JESSICA:
To see me thus transformed to a boy.
LORENZO:
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
JESSICA:
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
JESSICA:
They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
JESSICA:
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,
JESSICA:
And I should be obscured.
LORENZO:
So are you, sweet,
LORENZO:
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
LORENZO:
But come at once,
LORENZO:
For the close night doth play the runaway,
LORENZO:
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
JESSICA:
I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
JESSICA:
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
JESSICA:
Exit above
GRATIANO:
Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.
LORENZO:
Beshrew me but I love her heartily,
LORENZO:
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
LORENZO:
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
LORENZO:
And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
LORENZO:
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
LORENZO:
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
LORENZO:
Enter JESSICA, below
LORENZO:
What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away!
LORENZO:
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
LORENZO:
Exit with Jessica and Salarino
LORENZO:
Enter ANTONIO
ANTONIO:
Who's there?
GRATIANO:
Signior Antonio!
ANTONIO:
Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
ANTONIO:
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
ANTONIO:
No masque to-night: the wind is come about,
ANTONIO:
Bassanio presently will go aboard
ANTONIO:
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
GRATIANO:
I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
GRATIANO:
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
GRATIANO:
Exeunt
GRATIANO:
SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
GRATIANO:
Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains
PORTIA:
Go draw aside the curtains and discover
PORTIA:
The several caskets to this noble prince.
PORTIA:
Now make your choice.
MOROCCO:
The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
MOROCCO:
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire,'
MOROCCO:
The second, silver, which this promise carries,
MOROCCO:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves,'
MOROCCO:
This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
MOROCCO:
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
MOROCCO:
How shall I know if I do choose the right?
PORTIA:
The one of them contains my picture, prince
PORTIA:
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
MOROCCO:
Some god direct my judgment! Let me see,
MOROCCO:
I will survey the inscriptions back again.
MOROCCO:
What says this leaden casket?
MOROCCO:
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
MOROCCO:
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
MOROCCO:
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
MOROCCO:
Do it in hope of fair advantages
MOROCCO:
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross,
MOROCCO:
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
MOROCCO:
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
MOROCCO:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
MOROCCO:
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
MOROCCO:
And weigh thy value with an even hand
MOROCCO:
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
MOROCCO:
Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough
MOROCCO:
May not extend so far as to the lady
MOROCCO:
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
MOROCCO:
Were but a weak disabling of myself.
MOROCCO:
As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady
MOROCCO:
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
MOROCCO:
In graces and in qualities of breeding,
MOROCCO:
But more than these, in love I do deserve.
MOROCCO:
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
MOROCCO:
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
MOROCCO:
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
MOROCCO:
Why, that's the lady, all the world desires her,
MOROCCO:
From the four corners of the earth they come,
MOROCCO:
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint
MOROCCO:
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
MOROCCO:
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
MOROCCO:
For princes to come view fair Portia
MOROCCO:
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
MOROCCO:
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
MOROCCO:
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
MOROCCO:
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
MOROCCO:
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
MOROCCO:
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
MOROCCO:
To think so base a thought: it were too gross
MOROCCO:
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
MOROCCO:
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
MOROCCO:
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
MOROCCO:
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
MOROCCO:
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
MOROCCO:
A coin that bears the figure of an angel
MOROCCO:
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon,
MOROCCO:
But here an angel in a golden bed
MOROCCO:
Lies all within. Deliver me the key
MOROCCO:
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
PORTIA:
There, take it, prince, and if my form lie there,
PORTIA:
Then I am yours.
PORTIA:
He unlocks the golden casket
MOROCCO:
O hell! what have we here?
MOROCCO:
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
MOROCCO:
There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
MOROCCO:
Reads
MOROCCO:
All that glitters is not gold,
MOROCCO:
Often have you heard that told
MOROCCO:
Many a man his life hath sold
MOROCCO:
But my outside to behold
MOROCCO:
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
MOROCCO:
Had you been as wise as bold,
MOROCCO:
Young in limbs, in judgment old,
MOROCCO:
Your answer had not been inscroll'd
MOROCCO:
Fare you well, your suit is cold.
MOROCCO:
Cold, indeed, and labour lost
MOROCCO:
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
MOROCCO:
Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
MOROCCO:
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
MOROCCO:
Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets
PORTIA:
A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
PORTIA:
Let all of his complexion choose me so.
PORTIA:
Exeunt
PORTIA:
SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.
PORTIA:
Enter SALARINO and SALANIO
SALARINO:
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail
SALARINO:
With him is Gratiano gone along,
SALARINO:
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
SALANIO:
The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
SALANIO:
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
SALARINO:
He came too late, the ship was under sail
SALARINO:
But there the duke was given to understand
SALARINO:
That in a gondola were seen together
SALARINO:
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica
SALARINO:
Besides, Antonio certified the duke
SALARINO:
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
SALANIO:
I never heard a passion so confused,
SALANIO:
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
SALANIO:
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets
SALANIO:
'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
SALANIO:
Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
SALANIO:
Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
SALANIO:
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
SALANIO:
Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
SALANIO:
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
SALANIO:
Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl,
SALANIO:
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'
SALARINO:
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
SALARINO:
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
SALANIO:
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
SALANIO:
Or he shall pay for this.
SALARINO:
Marry, well remember'd.
SALARINO:
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
SALARINO:
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
SALARINO:
The French and English, there miscarried
SALARINO:
A vessel of our country richly fraught
SALARINO:
I thought upon Antonio when he told me,
SALARINO:
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
SALANIO:
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear,
SALANIO:
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
SALARINO:
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
SALARINO:
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part
SALARINO:
Bassanio told him he would make some speed
SALARINO:
Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so,
SALARINO:
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
SALARINO:
But stay the very riping of the time,
SALARINO:
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
SALARINO:
Let it not enter in your mind of love
SALARINO:
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
SALARINO:
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
SALARINO:
As shall conveniently become you there:'
SALARINO:
And even there, his eye being big with tears,
SALARINO:
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
SALARINO:
And with affection wondrous sensible
SALARINO:
He wrung Bassanio's hand, and so they parted.
SALANIO:
I think he only loves the world for him.
SALANIO:
I pray thee, let us go and find him out
SALANIO:
And quicken his embraced heaviness
SALANIO:
With some delight or other.
SALARINO:
Do we so.
SALARINO:
Exeunt
SALARINO:
SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
SALARINO:
Enter NERISSA with a Servitor
NERISSA:
Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight
NERISSA:
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
NERISSA:
And comes to his election presently.
NERISSA:
Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their trains
PORTIA:
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince
PORTIA:
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
PORTIA:
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized
PORTIA:
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
PORTIA:
You must be gone from hence immediately.
ARRAGON:
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things
ARRAGON:
First, never to unfold to any one
ARRAGON:
Which casket 'twas I chose, next, if I fail
ARRAGON:
Of the right casket, never in my life
ARRAGON:
To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
ARRAGON:
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
ARRAGON:
Immediately to leave you and be gone.
PORTIA:
To these injunctions every one doth swear
PORTIA:
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
ARRAGON:
And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
ARRAGON:
To my heart's hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.
ARRAGON:
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
ARRAGON:
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
ARRAGON:
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see
ARRAGON:
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
ARRAGON:
What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
ARRAGON:
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
ARRAGON:
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,
ARRAGON:
Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
ARRAGON:
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
ARRAGON:
Even in the force and road of casualty.
ARRAGON:
I will not choose what many men desire,
ARRAGON:
Because I will not jump with common spirits
ARRAGON:
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
ARRAGON:
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house,
ARRAGON:
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear
ARRAGON:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
ARRAGON:
And well said too, for who shall go about
ARRAGON:
To cozen fortune and be honourable
ARRAGON:
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
ARRAGON:
To wear an undeserved dignity.
ARRAGON:
O, that estates, degrees and offices
ARRAGON:
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
ARRAGON:
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
ARRAGON:
How many then should cover that stand bare!
ARRAGON:
How many be commanded that command!
ARRAGON:
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
ARRAGON:
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
ARRAGON:
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
ARRAGON:
To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice
ARRAGON:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
ARRAGON:
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
ARRAGON:
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
ARRAGON:
He opens the silver casket
PORTIA:
Too long a pause for that which you find there.
ARRAGON:
What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
ARRAGON:
Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
ARRAGON:
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
ARRAGON:
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
ARRAGON:
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
ARRAGON:
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
ARRAGON:
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
PORTIA:
To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
PORTIA:
And of opposed natures.
ARRAGON:
What is here?
ARRAGON:
Reads
ARRAGON:
The fire seven times tried this
ARRAGON:
Seven times tried that judgment is,
ARRAGON:
That did never choose amiss.
ARRAGON:
Some there be that shadows kiss,
ARRAGON:
Such have but a shadow's bliss
ARRAGON:
There be fools alive, I wis,
ARRAGON:
Silver'd o'er, and so was this.
ARRAGON:
Take what wife you will to bed,
ARRAGON:
I will ever be your head
ARRAGON:
So be gone: you are sped.
ARRAGON:
Still more fool I shall appear
ARRAGON:
By the time I linger here
ARRAGON:
With one fool's head I came to woo,
ARRAGON:
But I go away with two.
ARRAGON:
Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
ARRAGON:
Patiently to bear my wroth.
ARRAGON:
Exeunt Arragon and train
PORTIA:
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
PORTIA:
O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
PORTIA:
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
NERISSA:
The ancient saying is no heresy,
NERISSA:
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
PORTIA:
Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
PORTIA:
Enter a Servant
Servant:
Where is my lady?
PORTIA:
Here: what would my lord?
Servant:
Madam, there is alighted at your gate
Servant:
A young Venetian, one that comes before
Servant:
To signify the approaching of his lord,
Servant:
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
Servant:
To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
Servant:
Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
Servant:
So likely an ambassador of love
Servant:
A day in April never came so sweet,
Servant:
To show how costly summer was at hand,
Servant:
As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
PORTIA:
No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
PORTIA:
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
PORTIA:
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
PORTIA:
Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see
PORTIA:
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
NERISSA:
Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!
NERISSA:
Exeunt
NERISSA:
ACT III
NERISSA:
SCENE I. Venice. A street.
NERISSA:
Enter SALANIO and SALARINO
SALANIO:
Now, what news on the Rialto?
SALARINO:
Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath
SALARINO:
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas,
SALARINO:
the Goodwins, I think they call the place, a very
SALARINO:
dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
SALARINO:
a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
SALARINO:
Report be an honest woman of her word.
SALANIO:
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
SALANIO:
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
SALANIO:
wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
SALANIO:
true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
SALANIO:
plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
SALANIO:
honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
SALANIO:
to keep his name company!--
SALARINO:
Come, the full stop.
SALANIO:
Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
SALANIO:
lost a ship.
SALARINO:
I would it might prove the end of his losses.
SALANIO:
Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
SALANIO:
prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
SALANIO:
Enter SHYLOCK
SALANIO:
How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?
SHYLOCK:
You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
SHYLOCK:
daughter's flight.
SALARINO:
That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
SALARINO:
that made the wings she flew withal.
SALANIO:
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
SALANIO:
fledged, and then it is the complexion of them all
SALANIO:
to leave the dam.
SHYLOCK:
She is damned for it.
SALANIO:
That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
SHYLOCK:
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
SALANIO:
Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?
SHYLOCK:
I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
SALARINO:
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
SALARINO:
than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods
SALARINO:
than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
SALARINO:
tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
SALARINO:
loss at sea or no?
SHYLOCK:
There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
SHYLOCK:
prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
SHYLOCK:
Rialto, a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
SHYLOCK:
the mart, let him look to his bond: he was wont to
SHYLOCK:
call me usurer, let him look to his bond: he was
SHYLOCK:
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy, let him
SHYLOCK:
look to his bond.
SALARINO:
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take
SALARINO:
his flesh: what's that good for?
SHYLOCK:
To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
SHYLOCK:
it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
SHYLOCK:
hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses,
SHYLOCK:
mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
SHYLOCK:
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
SHYLOCK:
enemies, and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
SHYLOCK:
not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
SHYLOCK:
dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
SHYLOCK:
the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
SHYLOCK:
to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
SHYLOCK:
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
SHYLOCK:
a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
SHYLOCK:
if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
SHYLOCK:
us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
SHYLOCK:
revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
SHYLOCK:
resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
SHYLOCK:
what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
SHYLOCK:
wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
SHYLOCK:
Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
SHYLOCK:
teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
SHYLOCK:
will better the instruction.
SHYLOCK:
Enter a Servant
Servant:
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and
Servant:
desires to speak with you both.
SALARINO:
We have been up and down to seek him.
SALARINO:
Enter TUBAL
SALANIO:
Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
SALANIO:
matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
SALANIO:
Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant
SHYLOCK:
How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
SHYLOCK:
found my daughter?
TUBAL:
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
SHYLOCK:
Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,
SHYLOCK:
cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
SHYLOCK:
never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it
SHYLOCK:
till now: two thousand ducats in that, and other
SHYLOCK:
precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
SHYLOCK:
were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
SHYLOCK:
would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
SHYLOCK:
her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
SHYLOCK:
not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
SHYLOCK:
loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
SHYLOCK:
find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge
SHYLOCK:
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
SHYLOCK:
shoulders, no sighs but of my breathing, no tears
SHYLOCK:
but of my shedding.
TUBAL:
Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I
TUBAL:
heard in Genoa,--
SHYLOCK:
What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?
TUBAL:
Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.
SHYLOCK:
I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?
TUBAL:
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
SHYLOCK:
I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
SHYLOCK:
ha, ha! where? in Genoa?
TUBAL:
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one
TUBAL:
night fourscore ducats.
SHYLOCK:
Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
SHYLOCK:
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
SHYLOCK:
fourscore ducats!
TUBAL:
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
TUBAL:
company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.
SHYLOCK:
I am very glad of it: I'll plague him, I'll torture
SHYLOCK:
him: I am glad of it.
TUBAL:
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
TUBAL:
daughter for a monkey.
SHYLOCK:
Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
SHYLOCK:
turquoise, I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor
SHYLOCK:
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
TUBAL:
But Antonio is certainly undone.
SHYLOCK:
Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee
SHYLOCK:
me an officer, bespeak him a fortnight before. I
SHYLOCK:
will have the heart of him, if he forfeit, for, were
SHYLOCK:
he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
SHYLOCK:
will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue,
SHYLOCK:
go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.
SHYLOCK:
Exeunt
SHYLOCK:
SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
SHYLOCK:
Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and Attendants
PORTIA:
I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
PORTIA:
Before you hazard, for, in choosing wrong,
PORTIA:
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
PORTIA:
There's something tells me, but it is not love,
PORTIA:
I would not lose you, and you know yourself,
PORTIA:
Hate counsels not in such a quality.
PORTIA:
But lest you should not understand me well,--
PORTIA:
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
PORTIA:
I would detain you here some month or two
PORTIA:
Before you venture for me. I could teach you
PORTIA:
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn,
PORTIA:
So will I never be: so may you miss me,
PORTIA:
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
PORTIA:
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
PORTIA:
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me,
PORTIA:
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
PORTIA:
Mine own, I would say, but if mine, then yours,
PORTIA:
And so all yours. O, these naughty times
PORTIA:
Put bars between the owners and their rights!
PORTIA:
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
PORTIA:
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
PORTIA:
I speak too long, but 'tis to peize the time,
PORTIA:
To eke it and to draw it out in length,
PORTIA:
To stay you from election.
BASSANIO:
Let me choose
BASSANIO:
For as I am, I live upon the rack.
PORTIA:
Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
PORTIA:
What treason there is mingled with your love.
BASSANIO:
None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
BASSANIO:
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love
BASSANIO:
There may as well be amity and life
BASSANIO:
'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
PORTIA:
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
PORTIA:
Where men enforced do speak anything.
BASSANIO:
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
PORTIA:
Well then, confess and live.
BASSANIO:
'Confess' and 'love'
BASSANIO:
Had been the very sum of my confession
BASSANIO:
O happy torment, when my torturer
BASSANIO:
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
BASSANIO:
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
PORTIA:
Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them
PORTIA:
If you do love me, you will find me out.
PORTIA:
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
PORTIA:
Let music sound while he doth make his choice,
PORTIA:
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
PORTIA:
Fading in music: that the comparison
PORTIA:
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
PORTIA:
And watery death-bed for him. He may win,
PORTIA:
And what is music then? Then music is
PORTIA:
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
PORTIA:
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
PORTIA:
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
PORTIA:
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
PORTIA:
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
PORTIA:
With no less presence, but with much more love,
PORTIA:
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
PORTIA:
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
PORTIA:
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
PORTIA:
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
PORTIA:
With bleared visages, come forth to view
PORTIA:
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
PORTIA:
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
PORTIA:
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
PORTIA:
Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself
PORTIA:
SONG.
PORTIA:
Tell me where is fancy bred,
PORTIA:
Or in the heart, or in the head?
PORTIA:
How begot, how nourished?
PORTIA:
Reply, reply.
PORTIA:
It is engender'd in the eyes,
PORTIA:
With gazing fed, and fancy dies
PORTIA:
In the cradle where it lies.
PORTIA:
Let us all ring fancy's knell
PORTIA:
I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.
ALL:
Ding, dong, bell.
BASSANIO:
So may the outward shows be least themselves
BASSANIO:
The world is still deceived with ornament.
BASSANIO:
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
BASSANIO:
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
BASSANIO:
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
BASSANIO:
What damned error, but some sober brow
BASSANIO:
Will bless it and approve it with a text,
BASSANIO:
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
BASSANIO:
There is no vice so simple but assumes
BASSANIO:
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts
BASSANIO:
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
BASSANIO:
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
BASSANIO:
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,
BASSANIO:
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk,
BASSANIO:
And these assume but valour's excrement
BASSANIO:
To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
BASSANIO:
And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight,
BASSANIO:
Which therein works a miracle in nature,
BASSANIO:
Making them lightest that wear most of it
BASSANIO:
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
BASSANIO:
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
BASSANIO:
Upon supposed fairness, often known
BASSANIO:
To be the dowry of a second head,
BASSANIO:
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
BASSANIO:
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
BASSANIO:
To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf
BASSANIO:
Veiling an Indian beauty, in a word,
BASSANIO:
The seeming truth which cunning times put on
BASSANIO:
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
BASSANIO:
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,
BASSANIO:
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
BASSANIO:
'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
BASSANIO:
Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
BASSANIO:
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence,
BASSANIO:
And here choose I, joy be the consequence!
PORTIA:
[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,
PORTIA:
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
PORTIA:
And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,
PORTIA:
Be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,
PORTIA:
In measure rein thy joy, scant this excess.
PORTIA:
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
PORTIA:
For fear I surfeit.
BASSANIO:
What find I here?
BASSANIO:
Opening the leaden casket
BASSANIO:
Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
BASSANIO:
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
BASSANIO:
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
BASSANIO:
Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
BASSANIO:
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
BASSANIO:
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
BASSANIO:
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
BASSANIO:
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
BASSANIO:
Faster than gnats in cobwebs, but her eyes,--
BASSANIO:
How could he see to do them? having made one,
BASSANIO:
Methinks it should have power to steal both his
BASSANIO:
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
BASSANIO:
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
BASSANIO:
In underprizing it, so far this shadow
BASSANIO:
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
BASSANIO:
The continent and summary of my fortune.
BASSANIO:
Reads
BASSANIO:
You that choose not by the view,
BASSANIO:
Chance as fair and choose as true!
BASSANIO:
Since this fortune falls to you,
BASSANIO:
Be content and seek no new,
BASSANIO:
If you be well pleased with this
BASSANIO:
And hold your fortune for your bliss,
BASSANIO:
Turn you where your lady is
BASSANIO:
And claim her with a loving kiss.
BASSANIO:
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave,
BASSANIO:
I come by note, to give and to receive.
BASSANIO:
Like one of two contending in a prize,
BASSANIO:
That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
BASSANIO:
Hearing applause and universal shout,
BASSANIO:
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
BASSANIO:
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no,
BASSANIO:
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so,
BASSANIO:
As doubtful whether what I see be true,
BASSANIO:
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
PORTIA:
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
PORTIA:
Such as I am: though for myself alone
PORTIA:
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
PORTIA:
To wish myself much better, yet, for you
PORTIA:
I would be trebled twenty times myself,
PORTIA:
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
PORTIA:
That only to stand high in your account,
PORTIA:
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
PORTIA:
Exceed account, but the full sum of me
PORTIA:
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
PORTIA:
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised,
PORTIA:
Happy in this, she is not yet so old
PORTIA:
But she may learn, happier than this,
PORTIA:
She is not bred so dull but she can learn,
PORTIA:
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
PORTIA:
Commits itself to yours to be directed,
PORTIA:
As from her lord, her governor, her king.
PORTIA:
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
PORTIA:
Is now converted: but now I was the lord
PORTIA:
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
PORTIA:
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
PORTIA:
This house, these servants and this same myself
PORTIA:
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring,
PORTIA:
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
PORTIA:
Let it presage the ruin of your love
PORTIA:
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
BASSANIO:
Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
BASSANIO:
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,
BASSANIO:
And there is such confusion in my powers,
BASSANIO:
As after some oration fairly spoke
BASSANIO:
By a beloved prince, there doth appear
BASSANIO:
Among the buzzing pleased multitude,
BASSANIO:
Where every something, being blent together,
BASSANIO:
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
BASSANIO:
Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
BASSANIO:
Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence
BASSANIO:
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
NERISSA:
My lord and lady, it is now our time,
NERISSA:
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
NERISSA:
To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!
GRATIANO:
My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
GRATIANO:
I wish you all the joy that you can wish,
GRATIANO:
For I am sure you can wish none from me
GRATIANO:
And when your honours mean to solemnize
GRATIANO:
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
GRATIANO:
Even at that time I may be married too.
BASSANIO:
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
GRATIANO:
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
GRATIANO:
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours
GRATIANO:
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid,
GRATIANO:
You loved, I loved for intermission.
GRATIANO:
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
GRATIANO:
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
GRATIANO:
And so did mine too, as the matter falls,
GRATIANO:
For wooing here until I sweat again,
GRATIANO:
And sweating until my very roof was dry
GRATIANO:
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
GRATIANO:
I got a promise of this fair one here
GRATIANO:
To have her love, provided that your fortune
GRATIANO:
Achieved her mistress.
PORTIA:
Is this true, Nerissa?
NERISSA:
Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
BASSANIO:
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
GRATIANO:
Yes, faith, my lord.
BASSANIO:
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
GRATIANO:
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
NERISSA:
What, and stake down?
GRATIANO:
No, we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
GRATIANO:
But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
GRATIANO:
and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
GRATIANO:
Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger from Venice
BASSANIO:
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,
BASSANIO:
If that the youth of my new interest here
BASSANIO:
Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
BASSANIO:
I bid my very friends and countrymen,
BASSANIO:
Sweet Portia, welcome.
PORTIA:
So do I, my lord
PORTIA:
They are entirely welcome.
LORENZO:
I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
LORENZO:
My purpose was not to have seen you here,
LORENZO:
But meeting with Salerio by the way,
LORENZO:
He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
LORENZO:
To come with him along.
SALERIO:
I did, my lord,
SALERIO:
And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
SALERIO:
Commends him to you.
SALERIO:
Gives Bassanio a letter
BASSANIO:
Ere I ope his letter,
BASSANIO:
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
SALERIO:
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,
SALERIO:
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
SALERIO:
Will show you his estate.
GRATIANO:
Nerissa, cheer yon stranger, bid her welcome.
GRATIANO:
Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
GRATIANO:
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
GRATIANO:
I know he will be glad of our success,
GRATIANO:
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
SALERIO:
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
PORTIA:
There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
PORTIA:
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek
PORTIA:
Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world
PORTIA:
Could turn so much the constitution
PORTIA:
Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
PORTIA:
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
PORTIA:
And I must freely have the half of anything
PORTIA:
That this same paper brings you.
BASSANIO:
O sweet Portia,
BASSANIO:
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
BASSANIO:
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
BASSANIO:
When I did first impart my love to you,
BASSANIO:
I freely told you, all the wealth I had
BASSANIO:
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman,
BASSANIO:
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
BASSANIO:
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
BASSANIO:
How much I was a braggart. When I told you
BASSANIO:
My state was nothing, I should then have told you
BASSANIO:
That I was worse than nothing, for, indeed,
BASSANIO:
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
BASSANIO:
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
BASSANIO:
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,
BASSANIO:
The paper as the body of my friend,
BASSANIO:
And every word in it a gaping wound,
BASSANIO:
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
BASSANIO:
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
BASSANIO:
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
BASSANIO:
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
BASSANIO:
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
BASSANIO:
Of merchant-marring rocks?
SALERIO:
Not one, my lord.
SALERIO:
Besides, it should appear, that if he had
SALERIO:
The present money to discharge the Jew,
SALERIO:
He would not take it. Never did I know
SALERIO:
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
SALERIO:
So keen and greedy to confound a man
SALERIO:
He plies the duke at morning and at night,
SALERIO:
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
SALERIO:
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
SALERIO:
The duke himself, and the magnificoes
SALERIO:
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him,
SALERIO:
But none can drive him from the envious plea
SALERIO:
Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
JESSICA:
When I was with him I have heard him swear
JESSICA:
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
JESSICA:
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
JESSICA:
Than twenty times the value of the sum
JESSICA:
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
JESSICA:
If law, authority and power deny not,
JESSICA:
It will go hard with poor Antonio.
PORTIA:
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
BASSANIO:
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
BASSANIO:
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
BASSANIO:
In doing courtesies, and one in whom
BASSANIO:
The ancient Roman honour more appears
BASSANIO:
Than any that draws breath in Italy.
PORTIA:
What sum owes he the Jew?
BASSANIO:
For me three thousand ducats.
PORTIA:
What, no more?
PORTIA:
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond,
PORTIA:
Double six thousand, and then treble that,
PORTIA:
Before a friend of this description
PORTIA:
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
PORTIA:
First go with me to church and call me wife,
PORTIA:
And then away to Venice to your friend,
PORTIA:
For never shall you lie by Portia's side
PORTIA:
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
PORTIA:
To pay the petty debt twenty times over
PORTIA:
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
PORTIA:
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
PORTIA:
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
PORTIA:
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day
PORTIA:
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer
PORTIA:
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
PORTIA:
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
BASSANIO:
[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
BASSANIO:
miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
BASSANIO:
very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since
BASSANIO:
in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
BASSANIO:
debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
BASSANIO:
see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
BASSANIO:
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
BASSANIO:
let not my letter.
PORTIA:
O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!
BASSANIO:
Since I have your good leave to go away,
BASSANIO:
I will make haste: but, till I come again,
BASSANIO:
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
BASSANIO:
No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
BASSANIO:
Exeunt
BASSANIO:
SCENE III. Venice. A street.
BASSANIO:
Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler
SHYLOCK:
Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy,
SHYLOCK:
This is the fool that lent out money gratis
SHYLOCK:
Gaoler, look to him.
ANTONIO:
Hear me yet, good Shylock.
SHYLOCK:
I'll have my bond, speak not against my bond
SHYLOCK:
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
SHYLOCK:
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,
SHYLOCK:
But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs
SHYLOCK:
The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
SHYLOCK:
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
SHYLOCK:
To come abroad with him at his request.
ANTONIO:
I pray thee, hear me speak.
SHYLOCK:
I'll have my bond, I will not hear thee speak
SHYLOCK:
I'll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.
SHYLOCK:
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
SHYLOCK:
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
SHYLOCK:
To Christian intercessors. Follow not,
SHYLOCK:
I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
SHYLOCK:
Exit
SALARINO:
It is the most impenetrable cur
SALARINO:
That ever kept with men.
ANTONIO:
Let him alone
ANTONIO:
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
ANTONIO:
He seeks my life, his reason well I know
ANTONIO:
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
ANTONIO:
Many that have at times made moan to me,
ANTONIO:
Therefore he hates me.
SALARINO:
I am sure the duke
SALARINO:
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
ANTONIO:
The duke cannot deny the course of law
ANTONIO:
For the commodity that strangers have
ANTONIO:
With us in Venice, if it be denied,
ANTONIO:
Will much impeach the justice of his state,
ANTONIO:
Since that the trade and profit of the city
ANTONIO:
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go
ANTONIO:
These griefs and losses have so bated me,
ANTONIO:
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
ANTONIO:
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
ANTONIO:
Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
ANTONIO:
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
ANTONIO:
Exeunt
ANTONIO:
SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
ANTONIO:
Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR
LORENZO:
Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
LORENZO:
You have a noble and a true conceit
LORENZO:
Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly
LORENZO:
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
LORENZO:
But if you  knew to whom you show this honour,
LORENZO:
How true a gentleman you send relief,
LORENZO:
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
LORENZO:
I know you would be prouder of the work
LORENZO:
Than customary bounty can enforce you.
PORTIA:
I never did repent for doing good,
PORTIA:
Nor shall not now: for in companions
PORTIA:
That do converse and waste the time together,
PORTIA:
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
PORTIA:
There must be needs a like proportion
PORTIA:
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit,
PORTIA:
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
PORTIA:
Being the bosom lover of my lord,
PORTIA:
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
PORTIA:
How little is the cost I have bestow'd
PORTIA:
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
PORTIA:
From out the state of hellish misery!
PORTIA:
This comes too near the praising of myself,
PORTIA:
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
PORTIA:
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
PORTIA:
The husbandry and manage of my house
PORTIA:
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
PORTIA:
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
PORTIA:
To live in prayer and contemplation,
PORTIA:
Only attended by Nerissa here,
PORTIA:
Until her husband and my lord's return
PORTIA:
There is a monastery two miles off,
PORTIA:
And there will we abide. I do desire you
PORTIA:
Not to deny this imposition,
PORTIA:
The which my love and some necessity
PORTIA:
Now lays upon you.
LORENZO:
Madam, with all my heart,
LORENZO:
I shall obey you in all fair commands.
PORTIA:
My people do already know my mind,
PORTIA:
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
PORTIA:
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
PORTIA:
And so farewell, till we shall meet again.
LORENZO:
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
JESSICA:
I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
PORTIA:
I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
PORTIA:
To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
PORTIA:
Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO
PORTIA:
Now, Balthasar,
PORTIA:
As I have ever found thee honest-true,
PORTIA:
So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
PORTIA:
And use thou all the endeavour of a man
PORTIA:
In speed to Padua: see thou render this
PORTIA:
Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario,
PORTIA:
And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
PORTIA:
Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
PORTIA:
Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
PORTIA:
Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
PORTIA:
But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.
BALTHASAR:
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
BALTHASAR:
Exit
PORTIA:
Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand
PORTIA:
That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
PORTIA:
Before they think of us.
NERISSA:
Shall they see us?
PORTIA:
They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit,
PORTIA:
That they shall think we are accomplished
PORTIA:
With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
PORTIA:
When we are both accoutred like young men,
PORTIA:
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
PORTIA:
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
PORTIA:
And speak between the change of man and boy
PORTIA:
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
PORTIA:
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
PORTIA:
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
PORTIA:
How honourable ladies sought my love,
PORTIA:
Which I denying, they fell sick and died,
PORTIA:
I could not do withal, then I'll repent,
PORTIA:
And wish for all that, that I had not killed them,
PORTIA:
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
PORTIA:
That men shall swear I have discontinued school
PORTIA:
Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
PORTIA:
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
PORTIA:
Which I will practise.
NERISSA:
Why, shall we turn to men?
PORTIA:
Fie, what a question's that,
PORTIA:
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
PORTIA:
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
PORTIA:
When I am in my coach, which stays for us
PORTIA:
At the park gate, and therefore haste away,
PORTIA:
For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
PORTIA:
Exeunt
PORTIA:
SCENE V. The same. A garden.
PORTIA:
Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA
LAUNCELOT:
Yes, truly, for, look you, the sins of the father
LAUNCELOT:
are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
LAUNCELOT:
promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
LAUNCELOT:
you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter
LAUNCELOT:
therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
LAUNCELOT:
are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
LAUNCELOT:
you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard
LAUNCELOT:
hope neither.
JESSICA:
And what hope is that, I pray thee?
LAUNCELOT:
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
LAUNCELOT:
not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
JESSICA:
That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
JESSICA:
sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
LAUNCELOT:
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
LAUNCELOT:
mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
LAUNCELOT:
fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
LAUNCELOT:
gone both ways.
JESSICA:
I shall be saved by my husband, he hath made me a
JESSICA:
Christian.
LAUNCELOT:
Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
LAUNCELOT:
enow before, e'en as many as could well live, one by
LAUNCELOT:
another. This making Christians will raise the
LAUNCELOT:
price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
LAUNCELOT:
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
LAUNCELOT:
Enter LORENZO
JESSICA:
I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.
LORENZO:
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
LORENZO:
you thus get my wife into corners.
JESSICA:
Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
JESSICA:
are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
JESSICA:
me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
JESSICA:
says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
JESSICA:
for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
JESSICA:
price of pork.
LORENZO:
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
LORENZO:
you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
LORENZO:
Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
LAUNCELOT:
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason
LAUNCELOT:
but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
LAUNCELOT:
indeed more than I took her for.
LORENZO:
How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
LORENZO:
best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
LORENZO:
and discourse grow commendable in none only but
LORENZO:
parrots. Go in, sirrah, bid them prepare for dinner.
LAUNCELOT:
That is done, sir, they have all stomachs.
LORENZO:
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
LORENZO:
them prepare dinner.
LAUNCELOT:
That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
LORENZO:
Will you cover then, sir?
LAUNCELOT:
Not so, sir, neither, I know my duty.
LORENZO:
Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
LORENZO:
the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
LORENZO:
tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning
LORENZO:
go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve
LORENZO:
in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
LAUNCELOT:
For the table, sir, it shall be served in, for the
LAUNCELOT:
meat, sir, it shall be covered, for your coming in
LAUNCELOT:
to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
LAUNCELOT:
conceits shall govern.
LAUNCELOT:
Exit
LORENZO:
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
LORENZO:
The fool hath planted in his memory
LORENZO:
An army of good words, and I do know
LORENZO:
A many fools, that stand in better place,
LORENZO:
Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
LORENZO:
Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
LORENZO:
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
LORENZO:
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
JESSICA:
Past all expressing. It is very meet
JESSICA:
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,
JESSICA:
For, having such a blessing in his lady,
JESSICA:
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth,
JESSICA:
And if on earth he do not mean it, then
JESSICA:
In reason he should never come to heaven
JESSICA:
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
JESSICA:
And on the wager lay two earthly women,
JESSICA:
And Portia one, there must be something else
JESSICA:
Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
JESSICA:
Hath not her fellow.
LORENZO:
Even such a husband
LORENZO:
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
JESSICA:
Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
LORENZO:
I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.
JESSICA:
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
LORENZO:
No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk,
LORENZO:
'	Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
LORENZO:
I shall digest it.
JESSICA:
Well, I'll set you forth.
JESSICA:
Exeunt
JESSICA:
ACT IV
JESSICA:
SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.
JESSICA:
Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others
DUKE:
What, is Antonio here?
ANTONIO:
Ready, so please your grace.
DUKE:
I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
DUKE:
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
DUKE:
uncapable of pity, void and empty
DUKE:
From any dram of mercy.
ANTONIO:
I have heard
ANTONIO:
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
ANTONIO:
His rigorous course, but since he stands obdurate
ANTONIO:
And that no lawful means can carry me
ANTONIO:
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
ANTONIO:
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
ANTONIO:
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
ANTONIO:
The very tyranny and rage of his.
DUKE:
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
SALERIO:
He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
SALERIO:
Enter SHYLOCK
DUKE:
Make room, and let him stand before our face.
DUKE:
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
DUKE:
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
DUKE:
To the last hour of act, and then 'tis thought
DUKE:
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
DUKE:
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty,
DUKE:
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
DUKE:
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
DUKE:
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
DUKE:
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
DUKE:
Forgive a moiety of the principal,
DUKE:
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
DUKE:
That have of late so huddled on his back,
DUKE:
Enow to press a royal merchant down
DUKE:
And pluck commiseration of his state
DUKE:
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
DUKE:
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
DUKE:
To offices of tender courtesy.
DUKE:
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
SHYLOCK:
I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose,
SHYLOCK:
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
SHYLOCK:
To have the due and forfeit of my bond
SHYLOCK:
If you deny it, let the danger light
SHYLOCK:
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
SHYLOCK:
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
SHYLOCK:
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that
SHYLOCK:
But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
SHYLOCK:
What if my house be troubled with a rat
SHYLOCK:
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
SHYLOCK:
To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
SHYLOCK:
Some men there are love not a gaping pig,
SHYLOCK:
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat,
SHYLOCK:
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
SHYLOCK:
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
SHYLOCK:
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
SHYLOCK:
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer
SHYLOCK:
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
SHYLOCK:
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig,
SHYLOCK:
Why he, a harmless necessary cat,
SHYLOCK:
Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force
SHYLOCK:
Must yield to such inevitable shame
SHYLOCK:
As to offend, himself being offended,
SHYLOCK:
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
SHYLOCK:
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
SHYLOCK:
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
SHYLOCK:
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
BASSANIO:
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
BASSANIO:
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
SHYLOCK:
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
BASSANIO:
Do all men kill the things they do not love?
SHYLOCK:
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
BASSANIO:
Every offence is not a hate at first.
SHYLOCK:
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
ANTONIO:
I pray you, think you question with the Jew
ANTONIO:
You may as well go stand upon the beach
ANTONIO:
And bid the main flood bate his usual height,
ANTONIO:
You may as well use question with the wolf
ANTONIO:
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb,
ANTONIO:
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
ANTONIO:
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
ANTONIO:
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven,
ANTONIO:
You may as well do anything most hard,
ANTONIO:
As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
ANTONIO:
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
ANTONIO:
Make no more offers, use no farther means,
ANTONIO:
But with all brief and plain conveniency
ANTONIO:
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
BASSANIO:
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
SHYLOCK:
What judgment shall I dread, doing
SHYLOCK:
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
SHYLOCK:
I would not draw them, I would have my bond.
DUKE:
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
SHYLOCK:
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
SHYLOCK:
You have among you many a purchased slave,
SHYLOCK:
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
SHYLOCK:
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
SHYLOCK:
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
SHYLOCK:
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
SHYLOCK:
Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
SHYLOCK:
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
SHYLOCK:
Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
SHYLOCK:
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you
SHYLOCK:
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
SHYLOCK:
Is dearly bought, 'tis mine and I will have it.
SHYLOCK:
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
SHYLOCK:
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
SHYLOCK:
I stand for judgment: answer, shall I have it?
DUKE:
Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
DUKE:
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
DUKE:
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
DUKE:
Come here to-day.
SALERIO:
My lord, here stays without
SALERIO:
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
SALERIO:
New come from Padua.
DUKE:
Bring us the letter, call the messenger.
BASSANIO:
Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
BASSANIO:
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
BASSANIO:
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
ANTONIO:
I am a tainted wether of the flock,
ANTONIO:
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
ANTONIO:
Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me
ANTONIO:
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
ANTONIO:
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
ANTONIO:
Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk
DUKE:
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
NERISSA:
From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
NERISSA:
Presenting a letter
BASSANIO:
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
SHYLOCK:
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
GRATIANO:
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
GRATIANO:
Thou makest thy knife keen, but no metal can,
GRATIANO:
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
GRATIANO:
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
SHYLOCK:
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
GRATIANO:
O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
GRATIANO:
And for thy life let justice be accused.
GRATIANO:
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
GRATIANO:
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
GRATIANO:
That souls of animals infuse themselves
GRATIANO:
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
GRATIANO:
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
GRATIANO:
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
GRATIANO:
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
GRATIANO:
Infused itself in thee, for thy desires
GRATIANO:
Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.
SHYLOCK:
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
SHYLOCK:
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud
SHYLOCK:
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
SHYLOCK:
To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
DUKE:
This letter from Bellario doth commend
DUKE:
A young and learned doctor to our court.
DUKE:
Where is he?
NERISSA:
He attendeth here hard by,
NERISSA:
To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
DUKE:
With all my heart. Some three or four of you
DUKE:
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
DUKE:
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
Clerk:
[Reads]
Clerk:
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
Clerk:
your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
Clerk:
your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
Clerk:
me a young doctor of Rome, his name is Balthasar. I
Clerk:
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
Clerk:
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
Clerk:
many books together: he is furnished with my
Clerk:
opinion, which, bettered with his own learning, the
Clerk:
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
Clerk:
with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
Clerk:
request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
Clerk:
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
Clerk:
estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so
Clerk:
old a head. I leave him to your gracious
Clerk:
acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
Clerk:
commendation.
DUKE:
You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes
DUKE:
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
DUKE:
Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws
DUKE:
Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
PORTIA:
I did, my lord.
DUKE:
You are welcome: take your place.
DUKE:
Are you acquainted with the difference
DUKE:
That holds this present question in the court?
PORTIA:
I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
PORTIA:
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
DUKE:
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
PORTIA:
Is your name Shylock?
SHYLOCK:
Shylock is my name.
PORTIA:
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,
PORTIA:
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
PORTIA:
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
PORTIA:
You stand within his danger, do you not?
ANTONIO:
Ay, so he says.
PORTIA:
Do you confess the bond?
ANTONIO:
I do.
PORTIA:
Then must the Jew be merciful.
SHYLOCK:
On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
PORTIA:
The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
PORTIA:
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
PORTIA:
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest,
PORTIA:
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
PORTIA:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
PORTIA:
The throned monarch better than his crown,
PORTIA:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
PORTIA:
The attribute to awe and majesty,
PORTIA:
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings,
PORTIA:
But mercy is above this sceptred sway,
PORTIA:
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
PORTIA:
It is an attribute to God himself,
PORTIA:
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
PORTIA:
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
PORTIA:
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
PORTIA:
That, in the course of justice, none of us
PORTIA:
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy,
PORTIA:
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
PORTIA:
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
PORTIA:
To mitigate the justice of thy plea,
PORTIA:
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
PORTIA:
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
SHYLOCK:
My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
SHYLOCK:
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
PORTIA:
Is he not able to discharge the money?
BASSANIO:
Yes, here I tender it for him in the court,
BASSANIO:
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
BASSANIO:
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
BASSANIO:
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart
BASSANIO:
If this will not suffice, it must appear
BASSANIO:
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
BASSANIO:
Wrest once the law to your authority
BASSANIO:
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
BASSANIO:
And curb this cruel devil of his will.
PORTIA:
It must not be, there is no power in Venice
PORTIA:
Can alter a decree established
PORTIA:
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
PORTIA:
And many an error by the same example
PORTIA:
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
SHYLOCK:
A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
SHYLOCK:
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
PORTIA:
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
SHYLOCK:
Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
PORTIA:
Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.
SHYLOCK:
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven
SHYLOCK:
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
SHYLOCK:
No, not for Venice.
PORTIA:
Why, this bond is forfeit,
PORTIA:
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
PORTIA:
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
PORTIA:
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful
PORTIA:
Take thrice thy money, bid me tear the bond.
SHYLOCK:
When it is paid according to the tenor.
SHYLOCK:
It doth appear you are a worthy judge,
SHYLOCK:
You know the law, your exposition
SHYLOCK:
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
SHYLOCK:
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
SHYLOCK:
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
SHYLOCK:
There is no power in the tongue of man
SHYLOCK:
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
ANTONIO:
Most heartily I do beseech the court
ANTONIO:
To give the judgment.
PORTIA:
Why then, thus it is
PORTIA:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
SHYLOCK:
O noble judge! O excellent young man!
PORTIA:
For the intent and purpose of the law
PORTIA:
Hath full relation to the penalty,
PORTIA:
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
SHYLOCK:
'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
SHYLOCK:
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
PORTIA:
Therefore lay bare your bosom.
SHYLOCK:
Ay, his breast
SHYLOCK:
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
SHYLOCK:
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
PORTIA:
It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
PORTIA:
The flesh?
SHYLOCK:
I have them ready.
PORTIA:
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
PORTIA:
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
SHYLOCK:
Is it so nominated in the bond?
PORTIA:
It is not so express'd: but what of that?
PORTIA:
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
SHYLOCK:
I cannot find it, 'tis not in the bond.
PORTIA:
You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
ANTONIO:
But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
ANTONIO:
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
ANTONIO:
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you,
ANTONIO:
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
ANTONIO:
Than is her custom: it is still her use
ANTONIO:
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
ANTONIO:
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
ANTONIO:
An age of poverty, from which lingering penance
ANTONIO:
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
ANTONIO:
Commend me to your honourable wife
ANTONIO:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end,
ANTONIO:
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death,
ANTONIO:
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
ANTONIO:
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
ANTONIO:
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
ANTONIO:
And he repents not that he pays your debt,
ANTONIO:
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
ANTONIO:
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
BASSANIO:
Antonio, I am married to a wife
BASSANIO:
Which is as dear to me as life itself,
BASSANIO:
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
BASSANIO:
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life
BASSANIO:
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
BASSANIO:
Here to this devil, to deliver you.
PORTIA:
Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
PORTIA:
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
GRATIANO:
I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love
GRATIANO:
I would she were in heaven, so she could
GRATIANO:
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
NERISSA:
'Tis well you offer it behind her back,
NERISSA:
The wish would make else an unquiet house.
SHYLOCK:
These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter,
SHYLOCK:
Would any of the stock of Barrabas
SHYLOCK:
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
SHYLOCK:
Aside
SHYLOCK:
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
PORTIA:
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine
PORTIA:
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
SHYLOCK:
Most rightful judge!
PORTIA:
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast
PORTIA:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
SHYLOCK:
Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
PORTIA:
Tarry a little, there is something else.
PORTIA:
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood,
PORTIA:
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
PORTIA:
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,
PORTIA:
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
PORTIA:
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
PORTIA:
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
PORTIA:
Unto the state of Venice.
GRATIANO:
O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
SHYLOCK:
Is that the law?
PORTIA:
Thyself shalt see the act
PORTIA:
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
PORTIA:
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
GRATIANO:
O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!
SHYLOCK:
I take this offer, then, pay the bond thrice
SHYLOCK:
And let the Christian go.
BASSANIO:
Here is the money.
PORTIA:
Soft!
PORTIA:
The Jew shall have all justice, soft! no haste
PORTIA:
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
GRATIANO:
O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
PORTIA:
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
PORTIA:
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
PORTIA:
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
PORTIA:
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
PORTIA:
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
PORTIA:
Or the division of the twentieth part
PORTIA:
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
PORTIA:
But in the estimation of a hair,
PORTIA:
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
GRATIANO:
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
GRATIANO:
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
PORTIA:
Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
SHYLOCK:
Give me my principal, and let me go.
BASSANIO:
I have it ready for thee, here it is.
PORTIA:
He hath refused it in the open court
PORTIA:
He shall have merely justice and his bond.
GRATIANO:
A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
GRATIANO:
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
SHYLOCK:
Shall I not have barely my principal?
PORTIA:
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
PORTIA:
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
SHYLOCK:
Why, then the devil give him good of it!
SHYLOCK:
I'll stay no longer question.
PORTIA:
Tarry, Jew
PORTIA:
The law hath yet another hold on you.
PORTIA:
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
PORTIA:
If it be proved against an alien
PORTIA:
That by direct or indirect attempts
PORTIA:
He seek the life of any citizen,
PORTIA:
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
PORTIA:
Shall seize one half his goods, the other half
PORTIA:
Comes to the privy coffer of the state,
PORTIA:
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
PORTIA:
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
PORTIA:
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st,
PORTIA:
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
PORTIA:
That indirectly and directly too
PORTIA:
Thou hast contrived against the very life
PORTIA:
Of the defendant, and thou hast incurr'd
PORTIA:
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
PORTIA:
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
GRATIANO:
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself
GRATIANO:
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
GRATIANO:
Thou hast not left the value of a cord,
GRATIANO:
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
DUKE:
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
DUKE:
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
DUKE:
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's,
DUKE:
The other half comes to the general state,
DUKE:
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
PORTIA:
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
SHYLOCK:
Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that
SHYLOCK:
You take my house when you do take the prop
SHYLOCK:
That doth sustain my house, you take my life
SHYLOCK:
When you do take the means whereby I live.
PORTIA:
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
GRATIANO:
A halter gratis, nothing else, for God's sake.
ANTONIO:
So please my lord the duke and all the court
ANTONIO:
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
ANTONIO:
I am content, so he will let me have
ANTONIO:
The other half in use, to render it,
ANTONIO:
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
ANTONIO:
That lately stole his daughter
ANTONIO:
Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
ANTONIO:
He presently become a Christian,
ANTONIO:
The other, that he do record a gift,
ANTONIO:
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
ANTONIO:
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
DUKE:
He shall do this, or else I do recant
DUKE:
The pardon that I late pronounced here.
PORTIA:
Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?
SHYLOCK:
I am content.
PORTIA:
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
SHYLOCK:
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence,
SHYLOCK:
I am not well: send the deed after me,
SHYLOCK:
And I will sign it.
DUKE:
Get thee gone, but do it.
GRATIANO:
In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers
GRATIANO:
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
GRATIANO:
To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
GRATIANO:
Exit SHYLOCK
DUKE:
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
PORTIA:
I humbly do desire your grace of pardon
PORTIA:
I must away this night toward Padua,
PORTIA:
And it is meet I presently set forth.
DUKE:
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
DUKE:
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
DUKE:
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
DUKE:
Exeunt Duke and his train
BASSANIO:
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
BASSANIO:
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
BASSANIO:
Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof,
BASSANIO:
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
BASSANIO:
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
ANTONIO:
And stand indebted, over and above,
ANTONIO:
In love and service to you evermore.
PORTIA:
He is well paid that is well satisfied,
PORTIA:
And I, delivering you, am satisfied
PORTIA:
And therein do account myself well paid
PORTIA:
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
PORTIA:
I pray you, know me when we meet again
PORTIA:
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
BASSANIO:
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further
BASSANIO:
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
BASSANIO:
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
BASSANIO:
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
PORTIA:
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
PORTIA:
To ANTONIO
PORTIA:
Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake,
PORTIA:
To BASSANIO
PORTIA:
And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you
PORTIA:
Do not draw back your hand, I'll take no more,
PORTIA:
And you in love shall not deny me this.
BASSANIO:
This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
BASSANIO:
I will not shame myself to give you this.
PORTIA:
I will have nothing else but only this,
PORTIA:
And now methinks I have a mind to it.
BASSANIO:
There's more depends on this than on the value.
BASSANIO:
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
BASSANIO:
And find it out by proclamation
BASSANIO:
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
PORTIA:
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
PORTIA:
You taught me first to beg, and now methinks
PORTIA:
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
BASSANIO:
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife,
BASSANIO:
And when she put it on, she made me vow
BASSANIO:
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
PORTIA:
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
PORTIA:
An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
PORTIA:
And know how well I have deserved the ring,
PORTIA:
She would not hold out enemy for ever,
PORTIA:
For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
PORTIA:
Exeunt Portia and Nerissa
ANTONIO:
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring
ANTONIO:
Let his deservings and my love withal
ANTONIO:
Be valued against your wife's commandment.
BASSANIO:
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him,
BASSANIO:
Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
BASSANIO:
Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
BASSANIO:
Exit Gratiano
BASSANIO:
Come, you and I will thither presently,
BASSANIO:
And in the morning early will we both
BASSANIO:
Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.
BASSANIO:
Exeunt
BASSANIO:
SCENE II. The same. A street.
BASSANIO:
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
PORTIA:
Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
PORTIA:
And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
PORTIA:
And be a day before our husbands home
PORTIA:
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
PORTIA:
Enter GRATIANO
GRATIANO:
Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
GRATIANO:
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
GRATIANO:
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
GRATIANO:
Your company at dinner.
PORTIA:
That cannot be
PORTIA:
His ring I do accept most thankfully
PORTIA:
And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
PORTIA:
I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
GRATIANO:
That will I do.
NERISSA:
Sir, I would speak with you.
NERISSA:
Aside to PORTIA
NERISSA:
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
NERISSA:
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
PORTIA:
[Aside to NERISSA]  Thou mayst, I warrant.
PORTIA:
We shall have old swearing
PORTIA:
That they did give the rings away to men,
PORTIA:
But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
PORTIA:
Aloud
PORTIA:
Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.
NERISSA:
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
NERISSA:
Exeunt
NERISSA:
ACT V
NERISSA:
SCENE I. Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.
NERISSA:
Enter LORENZO and JESSICA
LORENZO:
The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
LORENZO:
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
LORENZO:
And they did make no noise, in such a night
LORENZO:
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
LORENZO:
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
LORENZO:
Where Cressid lay that night.
JESSICA:
In such a night
JESSICA:
Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
JESSICA:
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
JESSICA:
And ran dismay'd away.
LORENZO:
In such a night
LORENZO:
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
LORENZO:
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
LORENZO:
To come again to Carthage.
JESSICA:
In such a night
JESSICA:
Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
JESSICA:
That did renew old AEson.
LORENZO:
In such a night
LORENZO:
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
LORENZO:
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
LORENZO:
As far as Belmont.
JESSICA:
In such a night
JESSICA:
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
JESSICA:
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
JESSICA:
And ne'er a true one.
LORENZO:
In such a night
LORENZO:
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
LORENZO:
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
JESSICA:
I would out-night you, did no body come,
JESSICA:
But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
JESSICA:
Enter STEPHANO
LORENZO:
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
STEPHANO:
A friend.
LORENZO:
A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?
STEPHANO:
Stephano is my name, and I bring word
STEPHANO:
My mistress will before the break of day
STEPHANO:
Be here at Belmont, she doth stray about
STEPHANO:
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
STEPHANO:
For happy wedlock hours.
LORENZO:
Who comes with her?
STEPHANO:
None but a holy hermit and her maid.
STEPHANO:
I pray you, is my master yet return'd?
LORENZO:
He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
LORENZO:
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
LORENZO:
And ceremoniously let us prepare
LORENZO:
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
LORENZO:
Enter LAUNCELOT
LAUNCELOT:
Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
LORENZO:
Who calls?
LAUNCELOT:
Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
LAUNCELOT:
Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!
LORENZO:
Leave hollaing, man: here.
LAUNCELOT:
Sola! where? where?
LORENZO:
Here.
LAUNCELOT:
Tell him there's a post come from my master, with
LAUNCELOT:
his horn full of good news: my master will be here
LAUNCELOT:
ere morning.
LAUNCELOT:
Exit
LORENZO:
Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
LORENZO:
And yet no matter: why should we go in?
LORENZO:
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
LORENZO:
Within the house, your mistress is at hand,
LORENZO:
And bring your music forth into the air.
LORENZO:
Exit Stephano
LORENZO:
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
LORENZO:
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
LORENZO:
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
LORENZO:
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
LORENZO:
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
LORENZO:
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
LORENZO:
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
LORENZO:
But in his motion like an angel sings,
LORENZO:
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins,
LORENZO:
Such harmony is in immortal souls,
LORENZO:
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
LORENZO:
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
LORENZO:
Enter Musicians
LORENZO:
Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
LORENZO:
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
LORENZO:
And draw her home with music.
LORENZO:
Music
JESSICA:
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
LORENZO:
The reason is, your spirits are attentive
LORENZO:
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
LORENZO:
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
LORENZO:
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
LORENZO:
Which is the hot condition of their blood,
LORENZO:
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
LORENZO:
Or any air of music touch their ears,
LORENZO:
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
LORENZO:
Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
LORENZO:
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
LORENZO:
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods,
LORENZO:
Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
LORENZO:
But music for the time doth change his nature.
LORENZO:
The man that hath no music in himself,
LORENZO:
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
LORENZO:
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils,
LORENZO:
The motions of his spirit are dull as night
LORENZO:
And his affections dark as Erebus
LORENZO:
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
LORENZO:
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
PORTIA:
That light we see is burning in my hall.
PORTIA:
How far that little candle throws his beams!
PORTIA:
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
NERISSA:
When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
PORTIA:
So doth the greater glory dim the less
PORTIA:
A substitute shines brightly as a king
PORTIA:
Unto the king be by, and then his state
PORTIA:
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
PORTIA:
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
NERISSA:
It is your music, madam, of the house.
PORTIA:
Nothing is good, I see, without respect
PORTIA:
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
NERISSA:
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
PORTIA:
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
PORTIA:
When neither is attended, and I think
PORTIA:
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
PORTIA:
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
PORTIA:
No better a musician than the wren.
PORTIA:
How many things by season season'd are
PORTIA:
To their right praise and true perfection!
PORTIA:
Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
PORTIA:
And would not be awaked.
PORTIA:
Music ceases
LORENZO:
That is the voice,
LORENZO:
Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
PORTIA:
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
PORTIA:
By the bad voice.
LORENZO:
Dear lady, welcome home.
PORTIA:
We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
PORTIA:
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
PORTIA:
Are they return'd?
LORENZO:
Madam, they are not yet,
LORENZO:
But there is come a messenger before,
LORENZO:
To signify their coming.
PORTIA:
Go in, Nerissa,
PORTIA:
Give order to my servants that they take
PORTIA:
No note at all of our being absent hence,
PORTIA:
Nor you, Lorenzo, Jessica, nor you.
PORTIA:
A tucket sounds
LORENZO:
Your husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet
LORENZO:
We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.
PORTIA:
This night methinks is but the daylight sick,
PORTIA:
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
PORTIA:
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
PORTIA:
Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers
BASSANIO:
We should hold day with the Antipodes,
BASSANIO:
If you would walk in absence of the sun.
PORTIA:
Let me give light, but let me not be light,
PORTIA:
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
PORTIA:
And never be Bassanio so for me
PORTIA:
But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
BASSANIO:
I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
BASSANIO:
This is the man, this is Antonio,
BASSANIO:
To whom I am so infinitely bound.
PORTIA:
You should in all sense be much bound to him.
PORTIA:
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
ANTONIO:
No more than I am well acquitted of.
PORTIA:
Sir, you are very welcome to our house
PORTIA:
It must appear in other ways than words,
PORTIA:
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
GRATIANO:
[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong,
GRATIANO:
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk
GRATIANO:
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
GRATIANO:
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
PORTIA:
A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?
GRATIANO:
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
GRATIANO:
That she did give me, whose posy was
GRATIANO:
For all the world like cutler's poetry
GRATIANO:
Upon  a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
NERISSA:
What talk you of the posy or the value?
NERISSA:
You swore to me, when I did give it you,
NERISSA:
That you would wear it till your hour of death
NERISSA:
And that it should lie with you in your grave
NERISSA:
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
NERISSA:
You should have been respective and have kept it.
NERISSA:
Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
NERISSA:
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
GRATIANO:
He will, an if he live to be a man.
NERISSA:
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
GRATIANO:
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
GRATIANO:
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
GRATIANO:
No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk,
GRATIANO:
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee
GRATIANO:
I could not for my heart deny it him.
PORTIA:
You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
PORTIA:
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift
PORTIA:
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
PORTIA:
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
PORTIA:
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
PORTIA:
Never to part with it, and here he stands,
PORTIA:
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
PORTIA:
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
PORTIA:
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
PORTIA:
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
PORTIA:
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
BASSANIO:
[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
BASSANIO:
And swear I lost the ring defending it.
GRATIANO:
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
GRATIANO:
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
GRATIANO:
Deserved it too, and then the boy, his clerk,
GRATIANO:
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine,
GRATIANO:
And neither man nor master would take aught
GRATIANO:
But the two rings.
PORTIA:
What ring gave you my lord?
PORTIA:
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
BASSANIO:
If I could add a lie unto a fault,
BASSANIO:
I would deny it, but you see my finger
BASSANIO:
Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.
PORTIA:
Even so void is your false heart of truth.
PORTIA:
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
PORTIA:
Until I see the ring.
NERISSA:
Nor I in yours
NERISSA:
Till I again see mine.
BASSANIO:
Sweet Portia,
BASSANIO:
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
BASSANIO:
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
BASSANIO:
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
BASSANIO:
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
BASSANIO:
When nought would be accepted but the ring,
BASSANIO:
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
PORTIA:
If you had known the virtue of the ring,
PORTIA:
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
PORTIA:
Or your own honour to contain the ring,
PORTIA:
You would not then have parted with the ring.
PORTIA:
What man is there so much unreasonable,
PORTIA:
If you had pleased to have defended it
PORTIA:
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
PORTIA:
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
PORTIA:
Nerissa teaches me what to believe
PORTIA:
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
BASSANIO:
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
BASSANIO:
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
BASSANIO:
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
BASSANIO:
And begg'd the ring, the which I did deny him
BASSANIO:
And suffer'd him to go displeased away,
BASSANIO:
Even he that did uphold the very life
BASSANIO:
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
BASSANIO:
I was enforced to send it after him,
BASSANIO:
I was beset with shame and courtesy,
BASSANIO:
My honour would not let ingratitude
BASSANIO:
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,
BASSANIO:
For, by these blessed candles of the night,
BASSANIO:
Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
BASSANIO:
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
PORTIA:
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house
PORTIA:
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
PORTIA:
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
PORTIA:
I will become as liberal as you,
PORTIA:
I'll not deny him any thing I have,
PORTIA:
No, not my body nor my husband's bed
PORTIA:
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it
PORTIA:
Lie not a night from home, watch me like Argus
PORTIA:
If you do not, if I be left alone,
PORTIA:
Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
PORTIA:
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
NERISSA:
And I his clerk, therefore be well advised
NERISSA:
How you do leave me to mine own protection.
GRATIANO:
Well, do you so, let not me take him, then,
GRATIANO:
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
ANTONIO:
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
PORTIA:
Sir, grieve not you, you are welcome notwithstanding.
BASSANIO:
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,
BASSANIO:
And, in the hearing of these many friends,
BASSANIO:
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
BASSANIO:
Wherein I see myself--
PORTIA:
Mark you but that!
PORTIA:
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,
PORTIA:
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
PORTIA:
And there's an oath of credit.
BASSANIO:
Nay, but hear me
BASSANIO:
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
BASSANIO:
I never more will break an oath with thee.
ANTONIO:
I once did lend my body for his wealth,
ANTONIO:
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
ANTONIO:
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
ANTONIO:
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
ANTONIO:
Will never more break faith advisedly.
PORTIA:
Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
PORTIA:
And bid him keep it better than the other.
ANTONIO:
Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
BASSANIO:
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
PORTIA:
I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,
PORTIA:
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
NERISSA:
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
NERISSA:
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
NERISSA:
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
GRATIANO:
Why, this is like the mending of highways
GRATIANO:
In summer, where the ways are fair enough
GRATIANO:
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
PORTIA:
Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed
PORTIA:
Here is a letter, read it at your leisure,
PORTIA:
It comes from Padua, from Bellario
PORTIA:
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
PORTIA:
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
PORTIA:
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
PORTIA:
And even but now return'd, I have not yet
PORTIA:
Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome,
PORTIA:
And I have better news in store for you
PORTIA:
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon,
PORTIA:
There you shall find three of your argosies
PORTIA:
Are richly come to harbour suddenly
PORTIA:
You shall not know by what strange accident
PORTIA:
I chanced on this letter.
ANTONIO:
I am dumb.
BASSANIO:
Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
GRATIANO:
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
NERISSA:
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
NERISSA:
Unless he live until he be a man.
BASSANIO:
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow
BASSANIO:
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
ANTONIO:
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living,
ANTONIO:
For here I read for certain that my ships
ANTONIO:
Are safely come to road.
PORTIA:
How now, Lorenzo!
PORTIA:
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
NERISSA:
Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
NERISSA:
There do I give to you and Jessica,
NERISSA:
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
NERISSA:
After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
LORENZO:
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
LORENZO:
Of starved people.
PORTIA:
It is almost morning,
PORTIA:
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
PORTIA:
Of these events at full. Let us go in,
PORTIA:
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
PORTIA:
And we will answer all things faithfully.
GRATIANO:
Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
GRATIANO:
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
GRATIANO:
Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
GRATIANO:
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day
GRATIANO:
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
GRATIANO:
That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
GRATIANO:
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
GRATIANO:
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
GRATIANO:
Exeunt
