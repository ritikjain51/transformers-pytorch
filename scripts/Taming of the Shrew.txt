PRINCE:
SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.
PRINCE:
Enter Hostess and SLY
SLY:
I'll pheeze you, in faith.
Hostess:
A pair of stocks, you rogue!
SLY:
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues, look in
SLY:
the chronicles, we came in with Richard Conqueror.
SLY:
Therefore paucas pallabris, let the world slide: sessa!
Hostess:
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
SLY:
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
SLY:
bed, and warm thee.
Hostess:
I know my remedy, I must go fetch the
Hostess:
third--borough.
Hostess:
Exit
SLY:
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
SLY:
by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
SLY:
and kindly.
SLY:
Falls asleep
SLY:
Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train
Lord:
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds
Lord:
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd,
Lord:
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Lord:
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
Lord:
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
Lord:
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
First Huntsman:
Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord,
First Huntsman:
He cried upon it at the merest loss
First Huntsman:
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent
First Huntsman:
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
Lord:
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
Lord:
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
Lord:
But sup them well and look unto them all
Lord:
To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
First Huntsman:
I will, my lord.
Lord:
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
Second Huntsman:
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
Second Huntsman:
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
Lord:
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
Lord:
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
Lord:
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
Lord:
What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
Lord:
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
Lord:
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
Lord:
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Lord:
Would not the beggar then forget himself?
First Huntsman:
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
Second Huntsman:
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
Lord:
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Lord:
Then take him up and manage well the jest
Lord:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
Lord:
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures
Lord:
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
Lord:
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
Lord:
Procure me music ready when he wakes,
Lord:
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound,
Lord:
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
Lord:
And with a low submissive reverence
Lord:
Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
Lord:
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Lord:
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
Lord:
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
Lord:
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
Lord:
Some one be ready with a costly suit
Lord:
And ask him what apparel he will wear,
Lord:
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
Lord:
And that his lady mourns at his disease
Lord:
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
Lord:
And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
Lord:
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
Lord:
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs
Lord:
It will be pastime passing excellent,
Lord:
If it be husbanded with modesty.
First Huntsman:
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
First Huntsman:
As he shall think by our true diligence
First Huntsman:
He is no less than what we say he is.
Lord:
Take him up gently and to bed with him,
Lord:
And each one to his office when he wakes.
Lord:
Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds
Lord:
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds
Lord:
Exit Servingman
Lord:
Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
Lord:
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
Lord:
Re-enter Servingman
Lord:
How now! who is it?
Servant:
An't please your honour, players
Servant:
That offer service to your lordship.
Lord:
Bid them come near.
Lord:
Enter Players
Lord:
Now, fellows, you are welcome.
Players:
We thank your honour.
Lord:
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
A Player:
So please your lordship to accept our duty.
Lord:
With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
Lord:
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son
Lord:
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well
Lord:
I have forgot your name, but, sure, that part
Lord:
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
A Player:
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
Lord:
'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
Lord:
Well, you are come to me in a happy time,
Lord:
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Lord:
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
Lord:
There is a lord will hear you play to-night
Lord:
But I am doubtful of your modesties,
Lord:
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
Lord:
For yet his honour never heard a play--
Lord:
You break into some merry passion
Lord:
And so offend him, for I tell you, sirs,
Lord:
If you should smile he grows impatient.
A Player:
Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
A Player:
Were he the veriest antic in the world.
Lord:
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
Lord:
And give them friendly welcome every one
Lord:
Let them want nothing that my house affords.
Lord:
Exit one with the Players
Lord:
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
Lord:
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady
Lord:
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber,
Lord:
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
Lord:
Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
Lord:
He bear himself with honourable action,
Lord:
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Lord:
Unto their lords, by them accomplished
Lord:
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
Lord:
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
Lord:
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
Lord:
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
Lord:
May show her duty and make known her love?'
Lord:
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
Lord:
And with declining head into his bosom,
Lord:
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
Lord:
To see her noble lord restored to health,
Lord:
Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
Lord:
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar
Lord:
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
Lord:
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
Lord:
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Lord:
Which in a napkin being close convey'd
Lord:
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
Lord:
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst
Lord:
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
Lord:
Exit a Servingman
Lord:
I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
Lord:
Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman
Lord:
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
Lord:
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
Lord:
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
Lord:
I'll in to counsel them, haply my presence
Lord:
May well abate the over-merry spleen
Lord:
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
Lord:
Exeunt
Lord:
SCENE II. A bedchamber in the Lord's house.
Lord:
Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants, some with apparel, others with basin and ewer and appurtenances, and Lord
SLY:
For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
First Servant:
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
Second Servant:
Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?
Third Servant:
What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
SLY:
I am Christophero Sly, call not me 'honour' nor
SLY:
'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life, and if
SLY:
you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
SLY:
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear, for I
SLY:
have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
SLY:
than legs, nor no more shoes than feet, nay,
SLY:
sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
SLY:
toes look through the over-leather.
Lord:
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
Lord:
O, that a mighty man of such descent,
Lord:
Of such possessions and so high esteem,
Lord:
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
SLY:
What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
SLY:
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
SLY:
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
SLY:
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
SLY:
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
SLY:
she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
SLY:
on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
SLY:
lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
SLY:
bestraught: here's--
Third Servant:
O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
Second Servant:
O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
Lord:
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
Lord:
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
Lord:
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
Lord:
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
Lord:
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Lord:
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Lord:
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Lord:
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
Lord:
Music
Lord:
And twenty caged nightingales do sing
Lord:
Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
Lord:
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
Lord:
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
Lord:
Say thou wilt walk, we will bestrew the ground
Lord:
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
Lord:
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Lord:
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Lord:
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Lord:
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
Lord:
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
First Servant:
Say thou wilt course, thy greyhounds are as swift
First Servant:
As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.
Second Servant:
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
Second Servant:
Adonis painted by a running brook,
Second Servant:
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
Second Servant:
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
Second Servant:
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
Lord:
We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
Lord:
And how she was beguiled and surprised,
Lord:
As lively painted as the deed was done.
Third Servant:
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
Third Servant:
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
Third Servant:
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
Third Servant:
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
Lord:
Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord
Lord:
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Lord:
Than any woman in this waning age.
First Servant:
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
First Servant:
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
First Servant:
She was the fairest creature in the world,
First Servant:
And yet she is inferior to none.
SLY:
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
SLY:
Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
SLY:
I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak,
SLY:
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things
SLY:
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
SLY:
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
SLY:
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight,
SLY:
And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.
Second Servant:
Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
Second Servant:
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
Second Servant:
O, that once more you knew but what you are!
Second Servant:
These fifteen years you have been in a dream,
Second Servant:
Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.
SLY:
These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
SLY:
But did I never speak of all that time?
First Servant:
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words
First Servant:
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
First Servant:
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door,
First Servant:
And rail upon the hostess of the house,
First Servant:
And say you would present her at the leet,
First Servant:
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts
First Servant:
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
SLY:
Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
Third Servant:
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
Third Servant:
Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
Third Servant:
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
Third Servant:
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
Third Servant:
And twenty more such names and men as these
Third Servant:
Which never were nor no man ever saw.
SLY:
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!
ALL:
Amen.
SLY:
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
SLY:
Enter the Page as a lady, with attendants
Page:
How fares my noble lord?
SLY:
Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.
SLY:
Where is my wife?
Page:
Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?
SLY:
Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
SLY:
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.
Page:
My husband and my lord, my lord and husband,
Page:
I am your wife in all obedience.
SLY:
I know it well. What must I call her?
Lord:
Madam.
SLY:
Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
Lord:
'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords
Lord:
call ladies.
SLY:
Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
SLY:
And slept above some fifteen year or more.
Page:
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
Page:
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
SLY:
'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
SLY:
Madam, undress you and come now to bed.
Page:
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
Page:
To pardon me yet for a night or two,
Page:
Or, if not so, until the sun be set
Page:
For your physicians have expressly charged,
Page:
In peril to incur your former malady,
Page:
That I should yet absent me from your bed
Page:
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
SLY:
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
SLY:
tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
SLY:
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
SLY:
despite of the flesh and the blood.
SLY:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Your honour's players, heating your amendment,
Messenger:
Are come to play a pleasant comedy,
Messenger:
For so your doctors hold it very meet,
Messenger:
Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
Messenger:
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy
Messenger:
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
Messenger:
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
Messenger:
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
SLY:
Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a
SLY:
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
Page:
No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
SLY:
What, household stuff?
Page:
It is a kind of history.
SLY:
Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side
SLY:
and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.
SLY:
Flourish
SLY:
ACT I
SLY:
SCENE I. Padua. A public place.
SLY:
Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO
LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
LUCENTIO:
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
LUCENTIO:
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
LUCENTIO:
The pleasant garden of great Italy,
LUCENTIO:
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
LUCENTIO:
With his good will and thy good company,
LUCENTIO:
My trusty servant, well approved in all,
LUCENTIO:
Here let us breathe and haply institute
LUCENTIO:
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
LUCENTIO:
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
LUCENTIO:
Gave me my being and my father first,
LUCENTIO:
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
LUCENTIO:
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
LUCENTIO:
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
LUCENTIO:
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
LUCENTIO:
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds
LUCENTIO:
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
LUCENTIO:
Virtue and that part of philosophy
LUCENTIO:
Will I apply that treats of happiness
LUCENTIO:
By virtue specially to be achieved.
LUCENTIO:
Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left
LUCENTIO:
And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
LUCENTIO:
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
LUCENTIO:
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
TRANIO:
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
TRANIO:
I am in all affected as yourself,
TRANIO:
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
TRANIO:
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
TRANIO:
Only, good master, while we do admire
TRANIO:
This virtue and this moral discipline,
TRANIO:
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray,
TRANIO:
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
TRANIO:
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured
TRANIO:
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
TRANIO:
And practise rhetoric in your common talk,
TRANIO:
Music and poesy use to quicken you,
TRANIO:
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
TRANIO:
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you,
TRANIO:
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en
TRANIO:
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
LUCENTIO:
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
LUCENTIO:
We could at once put us in readiness,
LUCENTIO:
And take a lodging fit to entertain
LUCENTIO:
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
LUCENTIO:
But stay a while: what company is this?
TRANIO:
Master, some show to welcome us to town.
TRANIO:
Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by
BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
BAPTISTA:
For how I firmly am resolved you know,
BAPTISTA:
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
BAPTISTA:
Before I have a husband for the elder
BAPTISTA:
If either of you both love Katharina,
BAPTISTA:
Because I know you well and love you well,
BAPTISTA:
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
GREMIO:
[Aside]  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
GREMIO:
There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?
KATHARINA:
I pray you, sir, is it your will
KATHARINA:
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
HORTENSIO:
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear
KATHARINA:
I wis it is not half way to her heart,
KATHARINA:
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
KATHARINA:
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
KATHARINA:
And paint your face and use you like a fool.
HORTENSIA:
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
GREMIO:
And me too, good Lord!
TRANIO:
Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward
TRANIO:
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
LUCENTIO:
But in the other's silence do I see
LUCENTIO:
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
LUCENTIO:
Peace, Tranio!
TRANIO:
Well said, master, mum! and gaze your fill.
BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
BAPTISTA:
What I have said, Bianca, get you in
BAPTISTA:
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
BAPTISTA:
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
KATHARINA:
A pretty peat! it is best
KATHARINA:
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
BIANCA:
Sister, content you in my discontent.
BIANCA:
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe
BIANCA:
My books and instruments shall be my company,
BIANCA:
On them to took and practise by myself.
LUCENTIO:
Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.
HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
HORTENSIO:
Sorry am I that our good will effects
HORTENSIO:
Bianca's grief.
GREMIO:
Why will you mew her up,
GREMIO:
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
GREMIO:
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, content ye, I am resolved
BAPTISTA:
Go in, Bianca
BAPTISTA:
Exit BIANCA
BAPTISTA:
And for I know she taketh most delight
BAPTISTA:
In music, instruments and poetry,
BAPTISTA:
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
BAPTISTA:
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
BAPTISTA:
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
BAPTISTA:
Prefer them hither, for to cunning men
BAPTISTA:
I will be very kind, and liberal
BAPTISTA:
To mine own children in good bringing up
BAPTISTA:
And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay,
BAPTISTA:
For I have more to commune with Bianca.
BAPTISTA:
Exit
KATHARINA:
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
KATHARINA:
shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike, I
KATHARINA:
knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?
KATHARINA:
Exit
GREMIO:
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
GREMIO:
good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
GREMIO:
so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
GREMIO:
together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
GREMIO:
both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
GREMIO:
sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
GREMIO:
man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
GREMIO:
wish him to her father.
HORTENSIO:
So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
HORTENSIO:
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
HORTENSIO:
parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
HORTENSIO:
that we may yet again have access to our fair
HORTENSIO:
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
HORTENSIO:
labour and effect one thing specially.
GREMIO:
What's that, I pray?
HORTENSIO:
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
GREMIO:
A husband! a devil.
HORTENSIO:
I say, a husband.
GREMIO:
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
GREMIO:
her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool
GREMIO:
to be married to hell?
HORTENSIO:
Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
HORTENSIO:
to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
HORTENSIO:
fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
HORTENSIO:
would take her with all faults, and money enough.
GREMIO:
I cannot tell, but I had as lief take her dowry with
GREMIO:
this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
GREMIO:
every morning.
HORTENSIO:
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
HORTENSIO:
apples. But come, since this bar in law makes us
HORTENSIO:
friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
HORTENSIO:
maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
HORTENSIO:
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
HORTENSIO:
and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
HORTENSIO:
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
HORTENSIO:
How say you, Signior Gremio?
GREMIO:
I am agreed, and would I had given him the best
GREMIO:
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
GREMIO:
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
GREMIO:
house of her! Come on.
GREMIO:
Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
TRANIO:
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
TRANIO:
That love should of a sudden take such hold?
LUCENTIO:
O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
LUCENTIO:
I never thought it possible or likely,
LUCENTIO:
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
LUCENTIO:
I found the effect of love in idleness
LUCENTIO:
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
LUCENTIO:
That art to me as secret and as dear
LUCENTIO:
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
LUCENTIO:
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
LUCENTIO:
If I achieve not this young modest girl.
LUCENTIO:
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst,
LUCENTIO:
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
TRANIO:
Master, it is no time to chide you now,
TRANIO:
Affection is not rated from the heart
TRANIO:
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
TRANIO:
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, lad, go forward, this contents
LUCENTIO:
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
TRANIO:
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
TRANIO:
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
LUCENTIO:
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
LUCENTIO:
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
LUCENTIO:
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
LUCENTIO:
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
TRANIO:
Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
TRANIO:
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
TRANIO:
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
LUCENTIO:
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
LUCENTIO:
And with her breath she did perfume the air
LUCENTIO:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
TRANIO:
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
TRANIO:
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
TRANIO:
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands
TRANIO:
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
TRANIO:
That till the father rid his hands of her,
TRANIO:
Master, your love must live a maid at home,
TRANIO:
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
TRANIO:
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
LUCENTIO:
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
LUCENTIO:
But art thou not advised, he took some care
LUCENTIO:
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
TRANIO:
Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.
LUCENTIO:
I have it, Tranio.
TRANIO:
Master, for my hand,
TRANIO:
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
LUCENTIO:
Tell me thine first.
TRANIO:
You will be schoolmaster
TRANIO:
And undertake the teaching of the maid
TRANIO:
That's your device.
LUCENTIO:
It is: may it be done?
TRANIO:
Not possible, for who shall bear your part,
TRANIO:
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
TRANIO:
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
TRANIO:
Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
LUCENTIO:
Basta, content thee, for I have it full.
LUCENTIO:
We have not yet been seen in any house,
LUCENTIO:
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
LUCENTIO:
For man or master, then it follows thus,
LUCENTIO:
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
LUCENTIO:
Keep house and port and servants as I should
LUCENTIO:
I will some other be, some Florentine,
LUCENTIO:
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
LUCENTIO:
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
LUCENTIO:
Uncase thee, take my colour'd hat and cloak
LUCENTIO:
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,
LUCENTIO:
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
TRANIO:
So had you need.
TRANIO:
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
TRANIO:
And I am tied to be obedient,
TRANIO:
For so your father charged me at our parting,
TRANIO:
'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
TRANIO:
Although I think 'twas in another sense,
TRANIO:
I am content to be Lucentio,
TRANIO:
Because so well I love Lucentio.
LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves
LUCENTIO:
And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
LUCENTIO:
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
LUCENTIO:
Here comes the rogue.
LUCENTIO:
Enter BIONDELLO
LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, where have you been?
BIONDELLO:
Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
BIONDELLO:
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
BIONDELLO:
you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?
LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
LUCENTIO:
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
LUCENTIO:
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
LUCENTIO:
Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
LUCENTIO:
And I for my escape have put on his,
LUCENTIO:
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
LUCENTIO:
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried
LUCENTIO:
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
LUCENTIO:
While I make way from hence to save my life
LUCENTIO:
You understand me?
BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne'er a whit.
LUCENTIO:
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth
LUCENTIO:
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
BIONDELLO:
The better for him: would I were so too!
TRANIO:
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
TRANIO:
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
TRANIO:
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
TRANIO:
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies
TRANIO:
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio,
TRANIO:
But in all places else your master Lucentio.
LUCENTIO:
Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
LUCENTIO:
thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if
LUCENTIO:
thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good
LUCENTIO:
and weighty.
LUCENTIO:
Exeunt
LUCENTIO:
The presenters above speak
First Servant:
My lord, you nod, you do not mind the play.
SLY:
Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely
SLY:
comes there any more of it?
Page:
My lord, 'tis but begun.
SLY:
'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady
SLY:
would 'twere done!
SLY:
They sit and mark
SLY:
SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.
SLY:
Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO:
Verona, for a while I take my leave,
PETRUCHIO:
To see my friends in Padua, but of all
PETRUCHIO:
My best beloved and approved friend,
PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, and I trow this is his house.
PETRUCHIO:
Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.
GRUMIO:
Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
GRUMIO:
rebused your worship?
PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
GRUMIO:
Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
GRUMIO:
I should knock you here, sir?
PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
PETRUCHIO:
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
GRUMIO:
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
GRUMIO:
you first,
GRUMIO:
And then I know after who comes by the worst.
PETRUCHIO:
Will it not be?
PETRUCHIO:
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it,
PETRUCHIO:
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
PETRUCHIO:
He wrings him by the ears
GRUMIO:
Help, masters, help! my master is mad.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
PETRUCHIO:
Enter HORTENSIO
HORTENSIO:
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
HORTENSIO:
and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
PETRUCHIO:
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.
HORTENSIO:
'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
HORTENSIO:
mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
HORTENSIO:
this quarrel.
GRUMIO:
Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
GRUMIO:
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
GRUMIO:
service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
GRUMIO:
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
GRUMIO:
use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
GRUMIO:
two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
GRUMIO:
well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
PETRUCHIO:
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
PETRUCHIO:
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
PETRUCHIO:
And could not get him for my heart to do it.
GRUMIO:
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
GRUMIO:
words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
GRUMIO:
knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
GRUMIO:
now with, 'knocking at the gate'?
PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, patience, I am Grumio's pledge
HORTENSIO:
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
HORTENSIO:
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
HORTENSIO:
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
HORTENSIO:
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
PETRUCHIO:
To seek their fortunes farther than at home
PETRUCHIO:
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me
PETRUCHIO:
Antonio, my father, is deceased,
PETRUCHIO:
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
PETRUCHIO:
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may
PETRUCHIO:
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
PETRUCHIO:
And so am come abroad to see the world.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
HORTENSIO:
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
HORTENSIO:
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel
HORTENSIO:
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
HORTENSIO:
And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
HORTENSIO:
And I'll not wish thee to her.
PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
PETRUCHIO:
Few words suffice, and therefore, if thou know
PETRUCHIO:
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
PETRUCHIO:
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
PETRUCHIO:
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
PETRUCHIO:
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
PETRUCHIO:
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
PETRUCHIO:
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
PETRUCHIO:
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
PETRUCHIO:
As are the swelling Adriatic seas
PETRUCHIO:
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua,
PETRUCHIO:
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
GRUMIO:
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
GRUMIO:
mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
GRUMIO:
a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er
GRUMIO:
a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
GRUMIO:
as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
GRUMIO:
so money comes withal.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
HORTENSIO:
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
HORTENSIO:
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
HORTENSIO:
With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
HORTENSIO:
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
HORTENSIO:
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
HORTENSIO:
Is that she is intolerable curst
HORTENSIO:
And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
HORTENSIO:
That, were my state far worser than it is,
HORTENSIO:
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect
PETRUCHIO:
Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough,
PETRUCHIO:
For I will board her, though she chide as loud
PETRUCHIO:
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
HORTENSIO:
Her father is Baptista Minola,
HORTENSIO:
An affable and courteous gentleman
HORTENSIO:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
HORTENSIO:
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
PETRUCHIO:
I know her father, though I know not her,
PETRUCHIO:
And he knew my deceased father well.
PETRUCHIO:
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,
PETRUCHIO:
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
PETRUCHIO:
To give you over at this first encounter,
PETRUCHIO:
Unless you will accompany me thither.
GRUMIO:
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
GRUMIO:
O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
GRUMIO:
would think scolding would do little good upon him
GRUMIO:
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so
GRUMIO:
why, that's nothing, an he begin once, he'll rail in
GRUMIO:
his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
GRUMIO:
stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
GRUMIO:
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
GRUMIO:
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
GRUMIO:
You know him not, sir.
HORTENSIO:
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
HORTENSIO:
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is
HORTENSIO:
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
HORTENSIO:
His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
HORTENSIO:
And her withholds from me and other more,
HORTENSIO:
Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
HORTENSIO:
Supposing it a thing impossible,
HORTENSIO:
For those defects I have before rehearsed,
HORTENSIO:
That ever Katharina will be woo'd,
HORTENSIO:
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
HORTENSIO:
That none shall have access unto Bianca
HORTENSIO:
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
GRUMIO:
Katharina the curst!
GRUMIO:
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
HORTENSIO:
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
HORTENSIO:
And offer me disguised in sober robes
HORTENSIO:
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
HORTENSIO:
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,
HORTENSIO:
That so I may, by this device, at least
HORTENSIO:
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
HORTENSIO:
And unsuspected court her by herself.
GRUMIO:
Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
GRUMIO:
how the young folks lay their heads together!
GRUMIO:
Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised
GRUMIO:
Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?
HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, stand by a while.
GRUMIO:
A proper stripling and an amorous!
GREMIO:
O, very well, I have perused the note.
GREMIO:
Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound
GREMIO:
All books of love, see that at any hand,
GREMIO:
And see you read no other lectures to her
GREMIO:
You understand me: over and beside
GREMIO:
Signior Baptista's liberality,
GREMIO:
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
GREMIO:
And let me have them very well perfumed
GREMIO:
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
GREMIO:
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
LUCENTIO:
Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
LUCENTIO:
As for my patron, stand you so assured,
LUCENTIO:
As firmly as yourself were still in place
LUCENTIO:
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
LUCENTIO:
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
GREMIO:
O this learning, what a thing it is!
GRUMIO:
O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
PETRUCHIO:
Peace, sirrah!
HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.
GREMIO:
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
GREMIO:
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
GREMIO:
I promised to inquire carefully
GREMIO:
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca
GREMIO:
And by good fortune I have lighted well
GREMIO:
On this young man, for learning and behavior
GREMIO:
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
GREMIO:
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.
HORTENSIO:
'Tis well, and I have met a gentleman
HORTENSIO:
Hath promised me to help me to another,
HORTENSIO:
A fine musician to instruct our mistress,
HORTENSIO:
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
HORTENSIO:
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
GREMIO:
Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.
GRUMIO:
And that his bags shall prove.
HORTENSIO:
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love
HORTENSIO:
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
HORTENSIO:
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
HORTENSIO:
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
HORTENSIO:
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
HORTENSIO:
Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,
HORTENSIO:
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
GREMIO:
So said, so done, is well.
GREMIO:
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
PETRUCHIO:
I know she is an irksome brawling scold
PETRUCHIO:
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
PETRUCHIO:
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son
PETRUCHIO:
My father dead, my fortune lives for me,
PETRUCHIO:
And I do hope good days and long to see.
GREMIO:
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
GREMIO:
But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name
GREMIO:
You shall have me assisting you in all.
GREMIO:
But will you woo this wild-cat?
PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?
GRUMIO:
Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.
PETRUCHIO:
Why came I hither but to that intent?
PETRUCHIO:
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
PETRUCHIO:
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
PETRUCHIO:
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
PETRUCHIO:
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
PETRUCHIO:
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
PETRUCHIO:
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
PETRUCHIO:
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
PETRUCHIO:
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
PETRUCHIO:
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
PETRUCHIO:
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
PETRUCHIO:
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
PETRUCHIO:
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.
GRUMIO:
For he fears none.
GREMIO:
Hortensio, hark
GREMIO:
This gentleman is happily arrived,
GREMIO:
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
HORTENSIO:
I promised we would be contributors
HORTENSIO:
And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.
GREMIO:
And so we will, provided that he win her.
GRUMIO:
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
GRUMIO:
Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO
TRANIO:
Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
TRANIO:
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
TRANIO:
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
BIONDELLO:
He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
TRANIO:
Even he, Biondello.
GREMIO:
Hark you, sir, you mean not her to--
TRANIO:
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?
PETRUCHIO:
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
TRANIO:
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
LUCENTIO:
Well begun, Tranio.
HORTENSIO:
Sir, a word ere you go,
HORTENSIO:
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
TRANIO:
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
GREMIO:
No, if without more words you will get you hence.
TRANIO:
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
TRANIO:
For me as for you?
GREMIO:
But so is not she.
TRANIO:
For what reason, I beseech you?
GREMIO:
For this reason, if you'll know,
GREMIO:
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
HORTENSIO:
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
TRANIO:
Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
TRANIO:
Do me this right, hear me with patience.
TRANIO:
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
TRANIO:
To whom my father is not all unknown,
TRANIO:
And were his daughter fairer than she is,
TRANIO:
She may more suitors have and me for one.
TRANIO:
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers,
TRANIO:
Then well one more may fair Bianca have
TRANIO:
And so she shall, Lucentio shall make one,
TRANIO:
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
GREMIO:
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
LUCENTIO:
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.
PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
HORTENSIO:
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
HORTENSIO:
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
TRANIO:
No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,
TRANIO:
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
TRANIO:
As is the other for beauteous modesty.
PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, the first's for me, let her go by.
GREMIO:
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
GREMIO:
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understand you this of me in sooth
PETRUCHIO:
The younges t daughter whom you hearken for
PETRUCHIO:
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
PETRUCHIO:
And will not promise her to any man
PETRUCHIO:
Until the elder sister first be wed
PETRUCHIO:
The younger then is free and not before.
TRANIO:
If it be so, sir, that you are the man
TRANIO:
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
TRANIO:
And if you break the ice and do this feat,
TRANIO:
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
TRANIO:
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
TRANIO:
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
HORTENSIO:
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive,
HORTENSIO:
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
HORTENSIO:
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
HORTENSIO:
To whom we all rest generally beholding.
TRANIO:
Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
TRANIO:
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
TRANIO:
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
TRANIO:
And do as adversaries do in law,
TRANIO:
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
BIONDELLO:
O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed and be it so,
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.
HORTENSIO:
Exeunt
HORTENSIO:
ACT II
HORTENSIO:
SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.
HORTENSIO:
Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA
BIANCA:
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
BIANCA:
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me,
BIANCA:
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
BIANCA:
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
BIANCA:
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat,
BIANCA:
Or what you will command me will I do,
BIANCA:
So well I know my duty to my elders.
KATHARINA:
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
KATHARINA:
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
BIANCA:
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
BIANCA:
I never yet beheld that special face
BIANCA:
Which I could fancy more than any other.
KATHARINA:
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
BIANCA:
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
BIANCA:
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
BIANCA:
him.
KATHARINA:
O then, belike, you fancy riches more
KATHARINA:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
BIANCA:
Is it for him you do envy me so?
BIANCA:
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
BIANCA:
You have but jested with me all this while
BIANCA:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
KATHARINA:
If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
KATHARINA:
Strikes her
KATHARINA:
Enter BAPTISTA
BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
BAPTISTA:
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
BAPTISTA:
Go ply thy needle, meddle not with her.
BAPTISTA:
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
BAPTISTA:
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
BAPTISTA:
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
KATHARINA:
Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
KATHARINA:
Flies after BIANCA
BAPTISTA:
What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
BAPTISTA:
Exit BIANCA
KATHARINA:
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
KATHARINA:
She is your treasure, she must have a husband,
KATHARINA:
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
KATHARINA:
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
KATHARINA:
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
KATHARINA:
Till I can find occasion of revenge.
KATHARINA:
Exit
BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
BAPTISTA:
But who comes here?
BAPTISTA:
Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man,  PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician, and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books
GREMIO:
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
BAPTISTA:
God save you, gentlemen!
PETRUCHIO:
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
PETRUCHIO:
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?
BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.
GREMIO:
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
PETRUCHIO:
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
PETRUCHIO:
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
PETRUCHIO:
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
PETRUCHIO:
Her affability and bashful modesty,
PETRUCHIO:
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
PETRUCHIO:
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
PETRUCHIO:
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
PETRUCHIO:
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
PETRUCHIO:
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
PETRUCHIO:
I do present you with a man of mine,
PETRUCHIO:
Presenting HORTENSIO
PETRUCHIO:
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
PETRUCHIO:
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
PETRUCHIO:
Whereof I know she is not ignorant
PETRUCHIO:
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong
PETRUCHIO:
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
BAPTISTA:
You're welcome, sir, and he, for your good sake.
BAPTISTA:
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
BAPTISTA:
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
PETRUCHIO:
I see you do not mean to part with her,
PETRUCHIO:
Or else you like not of my company.
BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not, I speak but as I find.
BAPTISTA:
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,
PETRUCHIO:
A man well known throughout all Italy.
BAPTISTA:
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
GREMIO:
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
GREMIO:
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too
GREMIO:
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
PETRUCHIO:
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be doing.
GREMIO:
I doubt it not, sir, but you will curse your
GREMIO:
wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
GREMIO:
sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
GREMIO:
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
GREMIO:
any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
GREMIO:
Presenting LUCENTIO
GREMIO:
that hath been long studying at Rheims, as cunning
GREMIO:
in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
GREMIO:
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio, pray,
GREMIO:
accept his service.
BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
BAPTISTA:
Welcome, good Cambio.
BAPTISTA:
To TRANIO
BAPTISTA:
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger
BAPTISTA:
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
TRANIO:
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
TRANIO:
That, being a stranger in this city here,
TRANIO:
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
TRANIO:
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
TRANIO:
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
TRANIO:
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
TRANIO:
This liberty is all that I request,
TRANIO:
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
TRANIO:
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
TRANIO:
And free access and favour as the rest
TRANIO:
And, toward the education of your daughters,
TRANIO:
I here bestow a simple instrument,
TRANIO:
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books
TRANIO:
If you accept them, then their worth is great.
BAPTISTA:
Lucentio is your name, of whence, I pray?
TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.
BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa, by report
BAPTISTA:
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
BAPTISTA:
Take you the lute, and you the set of books,
BAPTISTA:
You shall go see your pupils presently.
BAPTISTA:
Holla, within!
BAPTISTA:
Enter a Servant
BAPTISTA:
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
BAPTISTA:
To my daughters, and tell them both,
BAPTISTA:
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
BAPTISTA:
Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following
BAPTISTA:
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
BAPTISTA:
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
BAPTISTA:
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
PETRUCHIO:
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
PETRUCHIO:
And every day I cannot come to woo.
PETRUCHIO:
You knew my father well, and in him me,
PETRUCHIO:
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
PETRUCHIO:
Which I have better'd rather than decreased
PETRUCHIO:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
PETRUCHIO:
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
BAPTISTA:
After my death the one half of my lands,
BAPTISTA:
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
PETRUCHIO:
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
PETRUCHIO:
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
PETRUCHIO:
In all my lands and leases whatsoever
PETRUCHIO:
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
PETRUCHIO:
That covenants may be kept on either hand.
BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
BAPTISTA:
That is, her love, for that is all in all.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
PETRUCHIO:
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded,
PETRUCHIO:
And where two raging fires meet together
PETRUCHIO:
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury
PETRUCHIO:
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
PETRUCHIO:
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
PETRUCHIO:
So I to her and so she yields to me,
PETRUCHIO:
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
BAPTISTA:
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
PETRUCHIO:
Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
PETRUCHIO:
That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
PETRUCHIO:
Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke
BAPTISTA:
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
HORTENSIO:
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
BAPTISTA:
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
HORTENSIO:
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
HORTENSIO:
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
BAPTISTA:
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
HORTENSIO:
Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me.
HORTENSIO:
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
HORTENSIO:
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,
HORTENSIO:
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
HORTENSIO:
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she, 'I'll fume
HORTENSIO:
with them:'
HORTENSIO:
And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
HORTENSIO:
And through the instrument my pate made way,
HORTENSIO:
And there I stood amazed for a while,
HORTENSIO:
As on a pillory, looking through the lute,
HORTENSIO:
While she did call me rascal fiddler
HORTENSIO:
And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,
HORTENSIO:
As had she studied to misuse me so.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench,
PETRUCHIO:
I love her ten times more than e'er I did
PETRUCHIO:
O, how I long to have some chat with her!
BAPTISTA:
Well, go with me and be not so discomfited
BAPTISTA:
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter,
BAPTISTA:
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
BAPTISTA:
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
BAPTISTA:
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
PETRUCHIO:
I pray you do.
PETRUCHIO:
Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
PETRUCHIO:
I will attend her here,
PETRUCHIO:
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
PETRUCHIO:
Say that she rail, why then I'll tell her plain
PETRUCHIO:
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale
PETRUCHIO:
Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
PETRUCHIO:
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew
PETRUCHIO:
Say she be mute and will not speak a word,
PETRUCHIO:
Then I'll commend her volubility,
PETRUCHIO:
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence
PETRUCHIO:
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
PETRUCHIO:
As though she bid me stay by her a week
PETRUCHIO:
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
PETRUCHIO:
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
PETRUCHIO:
But here she comes, and now, Petruchio, speak.
PETRUCHIO:
Enter KATHARINA
PETRUCHIO:
Good morrow, Kate, for that's your name, I hear.
KATHARINA:
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing
KATHARINA:
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
PETRUCHIO:
You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
PETRUCHIO:
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst,
PETRUCHIO:
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
PETRUCHIO:
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
PETRUCHIO:
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
PETRUCHIO:
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation,
PETRUCHIO:
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
PETRUCHIO:
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
PETRUCHIO:
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
PETRUCHIO:
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
KATHARINA:
Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
KATHARINA:
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
KATHARINA:
You were a moveable.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, what's a moveable?
KATHARINA:
A join'd-stool.
PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.
KATHARINA:
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, and so are you.
KATHARINA:
No such jade as you, if me you mean.
PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee,
PETRUCHIO:
For, knowing thee to be but young and light--
KATHARINA:
Too light for such a swain as you to catch,
KATHARINA:
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz!
KATHARINA:
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
PETRUCHIO:
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
KATHARINA:
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you wasp, i' faith, you are too angry.
KATHARINA:
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
KATHARINA:
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
PETRUCHIO:
Who knows not where a wasp does
PETRUCHIO:
wear his sting? In his tail.
KATHARINA:
In his tongue.
PETRUCHIO:
Whose tongue?
KATHARINA:
Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
PETRUCHIO:
Good Kate, I am a gentleman.
KATHARINA:
That I'll try.
KATHARINA:
She strikes him
PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
KATHARINA:
So may you lose your arms
KATHARINA:
If you strike me, you are no gentleman,
KATHARINA:
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
KATHARINA:
What is your crest? a coxcomb?
PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
KATHARINA:
No cock of mine, you crow too like a craven.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, Kate, come, you must not look so sour.
KATHARINA:
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's no crab, and therefore look not sour.
KATHARINA:
There is, there is.
PETRUCHIO:
Then show it me.
KATHARINA:
Had I a glass, I would.
PETRUCHIO:
What, you mean my face?
KATHARINA:
Well aim'd of such a young one.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
KATHARINA:
Yet you are wither'd.
PETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.
KATHARINA:
I care not.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
PETRUCHIO:
No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
PETRUCHIO:
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
PETRUCHIO:
And now I find report a very liar,
PETRUCHIO:
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
PETRUCHIO:
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers
PETRUCHIO:
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
PETRUCHIO:
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
PETRUCHIO:
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
PETRUCHIO:
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
PETRUCHIO:
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
PETRUCHIO:
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
PETRUCHIO:
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
PETRUCHIO:
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
PETRUCHIO:
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
PETRUCHIO:
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.
KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
PETRUCHIO:
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
PETRUCHIO:
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,
PETRUCHIO:
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
KATHARINA:
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
PETRUCHIO:
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
KATHARINA:
A witty mother! witless else her son.
PETRUCHIO:
Am I not wise?
KATHARINA:
Yes, keep you warm.
PETRUCHIO:
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed
PETRUCHIO:
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
PETRUCHIO:
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
PETRUCHIO:
That you shall be my wife, your dowry 'greed on,
PETRUCHIO:
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn,
PETRUCHIO:
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
PETRUCHIO:
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
PETRUCHIO:
Thou must be married to no man but me,
PETRUCHIO:
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
PETRUCHIO:
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
PETRUCHIO:
Conformable as other household Kates.
PETRUCHIO:
Here comes your father: never make denial,
PETRUCHIO:
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
PETRUCHIO:
Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO
BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
PETRUCHIO:
How but well, sir? how but well?
PETRUCHIO:
It were impossible I should speed amiss.
BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?
KATHARINA:
Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
KATHARINA:
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
KATHARINA:
To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
KATHARINA:
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
KATHARINA:
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
PETRUCHIO:
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
PETRUCHIO:
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her
PETRUCHIO:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
PETRUCHIO:
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove,
PETRUCHIO:
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn,
PETRUCHIO:
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
PETRUCHIO:
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity
PETRUCHIO:
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
PETRUCHIO:
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
KATHARINA:
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
GREMIO:
Hark, Petruchio, she says she'll see thee
GREMIO:
hang'd first.
TRANIO:
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, gentlemen, I choose her for myself
PETRUCHIO:
If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
PETRUCHIO:
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
PETRUCHIO:
That she shall still be curst in company.
PETRUCHIO:
I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
PETRUCHIO:
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
PETRUCHIO:
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
PETRUCHIO:
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
PETRUCHIO:
That in a twink she won me to her love.
PETRUCHIO:
O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
PETRUCHIO:
How tame, when men and women are alone,
PETRUCHIO:
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
PETRUCHIO:
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
PETRUCHIO:
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
PETRUCHIO:
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests,
PETRUCHIO:
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
BAPTISTA:
I know not what to say: but give me your hands,
BAPTISTA:
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.
TRANIO:
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
PETRUCHIO:
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu,
PETRUCHIO:
I will to Venice, Sunday comes apace
PETRUCHIO:
We will have rings and things and fine array,
PETRUCHIO:
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.
PETRUCHIO:
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally
GREMIO:
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
BAPTISTA:
And venture madly on a desperate mart.
TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you
TRANIO:
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
BAPTISTA:
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
GREMIO:
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
GREMIO:
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter
GREMIO:
Now is the day we long have looked for
GREMIO:
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
TRANIO:
And I am one that love Bianca more
TRANIO:
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
GREMIO:
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
TRANIO:
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
GREMIO:
But thine doth fry.
GREMIO:
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.
TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife
BAPTISTA:
'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
BAPTISTA:
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
BAPTISTA:
Shall have my Bianca's love.
BAPTISTA:
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?
GREMIO:
First, as you know, my house within the city
GREMIO:
Is richly furnished with plate and gold,
GREMIO:
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands,
GREMIO:
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry,
GREMIO:
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns,
GREMIO:
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
GREMIO:
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
GREMIO:
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
GREMIO:
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
GREMIO:
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
GREMIO:
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
GREMIO:
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
GREMIO:
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
GREMIO:
And all things answerable to this portion.
GREMIO:
Myself am struck in years, I must confess,
GREMIO:
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
GREMIO:
If whilst I live she will be only mine.
TRANIO:
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me
TRANIO:
I am my father's heir and only son
TRANIO:
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
TRANIO:
I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
TRANIO:
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
TRANIO:
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua,
TRANIO:
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
TRANIO:
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
TRANIO:
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
GREMIO:
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
GREMIO:
My land amounts not to so much in all
GREMIO:
That she shall have, besides an argosy
GREMIO:
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
GREMIO:
What, have I choked you with an argosy?
TRANIO:
Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
TRANIO:
Than three great argosies, besides two galliases,
TRANIO:
And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
TRANIO:
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
GREMIO:
Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more,
GREMIO:
And she can have no more than all I have
GREMIO:
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
TRANIO:
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
TRANIO:
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.
BAPTISTA:
I must confess your offer is the best,
BAPTISTA:
And, let your father make her the assurance,
BAPTISTA:
She is your own, else, you must pardon me,
BAPTISTA:
if you should die before him, where's her dower?
TRANIO:
That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
GREMIO:
And may not young men die, as well as old?
BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen,
BAPTISTA:
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
BAPTISTA:
My daughter Katharina is to be married
BAPTISTA:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
BAPTISTA:
Be bride to you, if you this assurance,
BAPTISTA:
If not, Signior Gremio
BAPTISTA:
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
GREMIO:
Adieu, good neighbour.
GREMIO:
Exit BAPTISTA
GREMIO:
Now I fear thee not
GREMIO:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
GREMIO:
To give thee all, and in his waning age
GREMIO:
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
GREMIO:
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
GREMIO:
Exit
TRANIO:
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
TRANIO:
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
TRANIO:
'Tis in my head to do my master good
TRANIO:
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
TRANIO:
Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio,'
TRANIO:
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
TRANIO:
Do get their children, but in this case of wooing,
TRANIO:
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
TRANIO:
Exit
TRANIO:
ACT III
TRANIO:
SCENE I. Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.
TRANIO:
Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA
LUCENTIO:
Fiddler, forbear, you grow too forward, sir
LUCENTIO:
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
LUCENTIO:
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
HORTENSIO:
But, wrangling pedant, this is
HORTENSIO:
The patroness of heavenly harmony
HORTENSIO:
Then give me leave to have prerogative,
HORTENSIO:
And when in music we have spent an hour,
HORTENSIO:
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
LUCENTIO:
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
LUCENTIO:
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
LUCENTIO:
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
LUCENTIO:
After his studies or his usual pain?
LUCENTIO:
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
LUCENTIO:
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
BIANCA:
To strive for that which resteth in my choice
BIANCA:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
BIANCA:
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
BIANCA:
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
BIANCA:
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down
BIANCA:
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles,
BIANCA:
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
HORTENSIO:
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
LUCENTIO:
That will be never: tune your instrument.
BIANCA:
Where left we last?
LUCENTIO:
Here, madam
LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,
LUCENTIO:
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
BIANCA:
Construe them.
LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
LUCENTIO:
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
LUCENTIO:
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love,
LUCENTIO:
'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
LUCENTIO:
a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
LUCENTIO:
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
LUCENTIO:
beguile the old pantaloon.
HORTENSIO:
Madam, my instrument's in tune.
BIANCA:
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
BIANCA:
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
BIANCA:
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
BIANCA:
trust you not, 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
BIANCA:
he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
BIANCA:
despair not.
HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.
LUCENTIO:
All but the base.
HORTENSIO:
The base is right, 'tis the base knave that jars.
HORTENSIO:
Aside
HORTENSIO:
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
HORTENSIO:
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love
HORTENSIO:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
BIANCA:
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
LUCENTIO:
Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
LUCENTIO:
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
BIANCA:
I must believe my master, else, I promise you,
BIANCA:
I should be arguing still upon that doubt
BIANCA:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you
BIANCA:
Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
BIANCA:
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
HORTENSIO:
You may go walk, and give me leave a while
HORTENSIO:
My lessons make no music in three parts.
LUCENTIO:
Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
LUCENTIO:
Aside
LUCENTIO:
And watch withal, for, but I be deceived,
LUCENTIO:
Our fine musician groweth amorous.
HORTENSIO:
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
HORTENSIO:
To learn the order of my fingering,
HORTENSIO:
I must begin with rudiments of art,
HORTENSIO:
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
HORTENSIO:
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
HORTENSIO:
Than hath been taught by any of my trade
HORTENSIO:
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.
BIANCA:
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
BIANCA:
[Reads]  ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
BIANCA:
'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion,
BIANCA:
'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
BIANCA:
'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection
BIANCA:
'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I
BIANCA:
'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'
BIANCA:
Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not
BIANCA:
Old fashions please me best, I am not so nice,
BIANCA:
To change true rules for old inventions.
BIANCA:
Enter a Servant
Servant:
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
Servant:
And help to dress your sister's chamber up
Servant:
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
BIANCA:
Farewell, sweet masters both, I must be gone.
BIANCA:
Exeunt BIANCA and Servant
LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
LUCENTIO:
Exit
HORTENSIO:
But I have cause to pry into this pedant
HORTENSIO:
Methinks he looks as though he were in love
HORTENSIO:
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
HORTENSIO:
To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
HORTENSIO:
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
HORTENSIO:
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
HORTENSIO:
Exit
HORTENSIO:
SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
HORTENSIO:
Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, LUCENTIO, and others, attendants
BAPTISTA:
[To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the
BAPTISTA:
'pointed day.
BAPTISTA:
That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,
BAPTISTA:
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
BAPTISTA:
What will be said? what mockery will it be,
BAPTISTA:
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
BAPTISTA:
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
BAPTISTA:
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
KATHARINA:
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
KATHARINA:
To give my hand opposed against my heart
KATHARINA:
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen,
KATHARINA:
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
KATHARINA:
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
KATHARINA:
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior
KATHARINA:
And, to be noted for a merry man,
KATHARINA:
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
KATHARINA:
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns,
KATHARINA:
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
KATHARINA:
Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
KATHARINA:
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
KATHARINA:
If it would please him come and marry her!'
TRANIO:
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
TRANIO:
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
TRANIO:
Whatever fortune stays him from his word
TRANIO:
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise,
TRANIO:
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
KATHARINA:
Would Katharina had never seen him though!
KATHARINA:
Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others
BAPTISTA:
Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,
BAPTISTA:
For such an injury would vex a very saint,
BAPTISTA:
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
BAPTISTA:
Enter BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO:
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
BIONDELLO:
you never heard of!
BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? how may that be?
BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?
BAPTISTA:
Is he come?
BIONDELLO:
Why, no, sir.
BAPTISTA:
What then?
BIONDELLO:
He is coming.
BAPTISTA:
When will he be here?
BIONDELLO:
When he stands where I am and sees you there.
TRANIO:
But say, what to thine old news?
BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
BIONDELLO:
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
BIONDELLO:
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
BIONDELLO:
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
BIONDELLO:
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless,
BIONDELLO:
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
BIONDELLO:
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred,
BIONDELLO:
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
BIONDELLO:
in the chine, troubled with the lampass, infected
BIONDELLO:
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
BIONDELLO:
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
BIONDELLO:
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
BIONDELLO:
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten,
BIONDELLO:
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
BIONDELLO:
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
BIONDELLO:
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
BIONDELLO:
often burst and now repaired with knots, one girth
BIONDELLO:
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
BIONDELLO:
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
BIONDELLO:
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
BAPTISTA:
Who comes with him?
BIONDELLO:
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
BIONDELLO:
like the horse, with a linen stock on one leg and a
BIONDELLO:
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
BIONDELLO:
and blue list, an old hat and 'the humour of forty
BIONDELLO:
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
BIONDELLO:
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
BIONDELLO:
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
TRANIO:
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion,
TRANIO:
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
BAPTISTA:
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
BIONDELLO:
Why, sir, he comes not.
BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not say he comes?
BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came?
BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio came.
BIONDELLO:
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.
BIONDELLO:
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
BIONDELLO:
I hold you a penny,
BIONDELLO:
A horse and a man
BIONDELLO:
Is more than one,
BIONDELLO:
And yet not many.
BIONDELLO:
Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO:
Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?
BAPTISTA:
You are welcome, sir.
PETRUCHIO:
And yet I come not well.
BAPTISTA:
And yet you halt not.
TRANIO:
Not so well apparell'd
TRANIO:
As I wish you were.
PETRUCHIO:
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
PETRUCHIO:
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
PETRUCHIO:
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown
PETRUCHIO:
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
PETRUCHIO:
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
PETRUCHIO:
Some comet or unusual prodigy?
BAPTISTA:
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day
BAPTISTA:
First were we sad, fearing you would not come,
BAPTISTA:
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
BAPTISTA:
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
BAPTISTA:
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
TRANIO:
And tells us, what occasion of import
TRANIO:
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
TRANIO:
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear
PETRUCHIO:
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
PETRUCHIO:
Though in some part enforced to digress,
PETRUCHIO:
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
PETRUCHIO:
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
PETRUCHIO:
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her
PETRUCHIO:
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
TRANIO:
See not your bride in these unreverent robes
TRANIO:
Go to my chamber, Put on clothes of mine.
PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
BAPTISTA:
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
PETRUCHIO:
Good sooth, even thus, therefore ha' done with words
PETRUCHIO:
To me she's married, not unto my clothes
PETRUCHIO:
Could I repair what she will wear in me,
PETRUCHIO:
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
PETRUCHIO:
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
PETRUCHIO:
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
PETRUCHIO:
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
PETRUCHIO:
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
PETRUCHIO:
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
TRANIO:
He hath some meaning in his mad attire
TRANIO:
We will persuade him, be it possible,
TRANIO:
To put on better ere he go to church.
BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, and see the event of this.
BAPTISTA:
Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants
TRANIO:
But to her love concerneth us to add
TRANIO:
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
TRANIO:
As I before unparted to your worship,
TRANIO:
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
TRANIO:
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
TRANIO:
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
TRANIO:
And make assurance here in Padua
TRANIO:
Of greater sums than I have promised.
TRANIO:
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
TRANIO:
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
LUCENTIO:
Were it not that my fellow-school-master
LUCENTIO:
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
LUCENTIO:
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage,
LUCENTIO:
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
LUCENTIO:
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.
TRANIO:
That by degrees we mean to look into,
TRANIO:
And watch our vantage in this business
TRANIO:
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
TRANIO:
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
TRANIO:
The quaint musician, amorous Licio,
TRANIO:
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
TRANIO:
Re-enter GREMIO
TRANIO:
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
GREMIO:
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
TRANIO:
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
GREMIO:
A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
GREMIO:
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
TRANIO:
Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
GREMIO:
Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
TRANIO:
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
GREMIO:
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
GREMIO:
Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
GREMIO:
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he, and swore so loud,
GREMIO:
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book,
GREMIO:
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
GREMIO:
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
GREMIO:
That down fell priest and book and book and priest
GREMIO:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
TRANIO:
What said the wench when he rose again?
GREMIO:
Trembled and shook, for why, he stamp'd and swore,
GREMIO:
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
GREMIO:
But after many ceremonies done,
GREMIO:
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
GREMIO:
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
GREMIO:
After a storm, quaff'd off the muscadel
GREMIO:
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
GREMIO:
Having no other reason
GREMIO:
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
GREMIO:
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
GREMIO:
This done, he took the bride about the neck
GREMIO:
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
GREMIO:
That at the parting all the church did echo
GREMIO:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame,
GREMIO:
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
GREMIO:
Such a mad marriage never was before
GREMIO:
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.
GREMIO:
Music
GREMIO:
Re-enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO, GRUMIO, and Train
PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains
PETRUCHIO:
I know you think to dine with me to-day,
PETRUCHIO:
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer,
PETRUCHIO:
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
PETRUCHIO:
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
BAPTISTA:
Is't possible you will away to-night?
PETRUCHIO:
I must away to-day, before night come
PETRUCHIO:
Make it no wonder, if you knew my business,
PETRUCHIO:
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
PETRUCHIO:
And, honest company, I thank you all,
PETRUCHIO:
That have beheld me give away myself
PETRUCHIO:
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife
PETRUCHIO:
Dine with my father, drink a health to me,
PETRUCHIO:
For I must hence, and farewell to you all.
TRANIO:
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
PETRUCHIO:
It may not be.
GREMIO:
Let me entreat you.
PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.
KATHARINA:
Let me entreat you.
PETRUCHIO:
I am content.
KATHARINA:
Are you content to stay?
PETRUCHIO:
I am content you shall entreat me stay,
PETRUCHIO:
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
KATHARINA:
Now, if you love me, stay.
PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.
GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.
KATHARINA:
Nay, then,
KATHARINA:
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day,
KATHARINA:
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
KATHARINA:
The door is open, sir, there lies your way,
KATHARINA:
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green,
KATHARINA:
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself
KATHARINA:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
KATHARINA:
That take it on you at the first so roundly.
PETRUCHIO:
O Kate, content thee, prithee, be not angry.
KATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
KATHARINA:
Father, be quiet, he shall stay my leisure.
GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
KATARINA:
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner
KATARINA:
I see a woman may be made a fool,
KATARINA:
If she had not a spirit to resist.
PETRUCHIO:
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
PETRUCHIO:
Obey the bride, you that attend on her,
PETRUCHIO:
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
PETRUCHIO:
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
PETRUCHIO:
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves
PETRUCHIO:
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret,
PETRUCHIO:
I will be master of what is mine own
PETRUCHIO:
She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,
PETRUCHIO:
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
PETRUCHIO:
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
PETRUCHIO:
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare,
PETRUCHIO:
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
PETRUCHIO:
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
PETRUCHIO:
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves,
PETRUCHIO:
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
PETRUCHIO:
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
PETRUCHIO:
thee, Kate
PETRUCHIO:
I'll buckler thee against a million.
PETRUCHIO:
Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, and GRUMIO
BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
GREMIO:
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
TRANIO:
Of all mad matches never was the like.
LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
BIANCA:
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
GREMIO:
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends, though bride and
BAPTISTA:
bridegroom wants
BAPTISTA:
For to supply the places at the table,
BAPTISTA:
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
BAPTISTA:
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place
BAPTISTA:
And let Bianca take her sister's room.
TRANIO:
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
BAPTISTA:
Exeunt
BAPTISTA:
ACT IV
BAPTISTA:
SCENE I. PETRUCHIO'S country house.
BAPTISTA:
Enter GRUMIO
GRUMIO:
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
GRUMIO:
all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
GRUMIO:
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
GRUMIO:
before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
GRUMIO:
warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
GRUMIO:
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
GRUMIO:
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
GRUMIO:
belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
GRUMIO:
I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself, for,
GRUMIO:
considering the weather, a taller man than I will
GRUMIO:
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.
GRUMIO:
Enter CURTIS
CURTIS:
Who is that calls so coldly?
GRUMIO:
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
GRUMIO:
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
GRUMIO:
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.
CURTIS:
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
GRUMIO:
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire, cast
GRUMIO:
on no water.
CURTIS:
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
GRUMIO:
She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
GRUMIO:
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast, for it
GRUMIO:
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
GRUMIO:
myself, fellow Curtis.
CURTIS:
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
GRUMIO:
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot, and
GRUMIO:
so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
GRUMIO:
fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
GRUMIO:
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
GRUMIO:
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?
CURTIS:
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
GRUMIO:
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine, and
GRUMIO:
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty, for
GRUMIO:
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
CURTIS:
There's fire ready, and therefore, good Grumio, the news.
GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
GRUMIO:
will thaw.
CURTIS:
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
GRUMIO:
Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold.
GRUMIO:
Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
GRUMIO:
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the
GRUMIO:
serving-men in their new fustian, their white
GRUMIO:
stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
GRUMIO:
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
GRUMIO:
the carpets laid, and every thing in order?
CURTIS:
All ready, and therefore, I pray thee, news.
GRUMIO:
First, know, my horse is tired, my master and
GRUMIO:
mistress fallen out.
CURTIS:
How?
GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby
GRUMIO:
hangs a tale.
CURTIS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio.
GRUMIO:
Lend thine ear.
CURTIS:
Here.
GRUMIO:
There.
GRUMIO:
Strikes him
CURTIS:
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
GRUMIO:
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
GRUMIO:
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
GRUMIO:
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
GRUMIO:
foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--
CURTIS:
Both of one horse?
GRUMIO:
What's that to thee?
CURTIS:
Why, a horse.
GRUMIO:
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
GRUMIO:
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
GRUMIO:
under her horse, thou shouldst have heard in how
GRUMIO:
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
GRUMIO:
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
GRUMIO:
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
GRUMIO:
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
GRUMIO:
that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
GRUMIO:
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
GRUMIO:
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
GRUMIO:
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
GRUMIO:
unexperienced to thy grave.
CURTIS:
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
GRUMIO:
Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
GRUMIO:
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
GRUMIO:
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
GRUMIO:
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
GRUMIO:
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
GRUMIO:
garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
GRUMIO:
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
GRUMIO:
of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
GRUMIO:
hands. Are they all ready?
CURTIS:
They are.
GRUMIO:
Call them forth.
CURTIS:
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
CURTIS:
countenance my mistress.
GRUMIO:
Why, she hath a face of her own.
CURTIS:
Who knows not that?
GRUMIO:
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
GRUMIO:
countenance her.
CURTIS:
I call them forth to credit her.
GRUMIO:
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
GRUMIO:
Enter four or five Serving-men
NATHANIEL:
Welcome home, Grumio!
PHILIP:
How now, Grumio!
JOSEPH:
What, Grumio!
NICHOLAS:
Fellow Grumio!
NATHANIEL:
How now, old lad?
GRUMIO:
Welcome, you,--how now, you,-- what, you,--fellow,
GRUMIO:
you,--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
GRUMIO:
companions, is all ready, and all things neat?
NATHANIEL:
All things is ready. How near is our master?
GRUMIO:
E'en at hand, alighted by this, and therefore be
GRUMIO:
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
GRUMIO:
Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
PETRUCHIO:
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
PETRUCHIO:
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
PETRUCHIO:
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
PETRUCHIO:
ALL SERVING-MEN	Here, here, sir, here, sir.
PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
PETRUCHIO:
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
PETRUCHIO:
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
PETRUCHIO:
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
GRUMIO:
Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.
PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
PETRUCHIO:
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
PETRUCHIO:
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
GRUMIO:
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel,
GRUMIO:
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
GRUMIO:
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing
GRUMIO:
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory,
GRUMIO:
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly,
GRUMIO:
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
PETRUCHIO:
Exeunt Servants
PETRUCHIO:
Singing
PETRUCHIO:
Where is the life that late I led--
PETRUCHIO:
Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
PETRUCHIO:
Sound, sound, sound, sound!
PETRUCHIO:
Re-enter Servants with supper
PETRUCHIO:
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
PETRUCHIO:
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
PETRUCHIO:
Sings
PETRUCHIO:
It was the friar of orders grey,
PETRUCHIO:
As he forth walked on his way:--
PETRUCHIO:
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry
PETRUCHIO:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
PETRUCHIO:
Strikes him
PETRUCHIO:
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here, what, ho!
PETRUCHIO:
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
PETRUCHIO:
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither
PETRUCHIO:
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
PETRUCHIO:
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
PETRUCHIO:
Enter one with water
PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
PETRUCHIO:
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
PETRUCHIO:
Strikes him
KATHARINA:
Patience, I pray you, 'twas a fault unwilling.
PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, sit down, I know you have a stomach.
PETRUCHIO:
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?
PETRUCHIO:
What's this? mutton?
First Servant:
Ay.
PETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?
PETER:
I.
PETRUCHIO:
'Tis burnt, and so is all the meat.
PETRUCHIO:
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
PETRUCHIO:
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
PETRUCHIO:
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
PETRUCHIO:
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all,
PETRUCHIO:
Throws the meat,  and c. about the stage
PETRUCHIO:
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
PETRUCHIO:
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
KATHARINA:
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet
KATHARINA:
The meat was well, if you were so contented.
PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,
PETRUCHIO:
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
PETRUCHIO:
For it engenders choler, planteth anger,
PETRUCHIO:
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
PETRUCHIO:
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
PETRUCHIO:
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, to-morrow 't shall be mended,
PETRUCHIO:
And, for this night, we'll fast for company
PETRUCHIO:
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
PETRUCHIO:
Exeunt
PETRUCHIO:
Re-enter Servants severally
NATHANIEL:
Peter, didst ever see the like?
PETER:
He kills her in her own humour.
PETER:
Re-enter CURTIS
GRUMIO:
Where is he?
CURTIS:
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her,
CURTIS:
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
CURTIS:
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
CURTIS:
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
CURTIS:
Away, away! for he is coming hither.
CURTIS:
Exeunt
CURTIS:
Re-enter PETRUCHIO
PETRUCHIO:
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
PETRUCHIO:
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
PETRUCHIO:
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,
PETRUCHIO:
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
PETRUCHIO:
For then she never looks upon her lure.
PETRUCHIO:
Another way I have to man my haggard,
PETRUCHIO:
To make her come and know her keeper's call,
PETRUCHIO:
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
PETRUCHIO:
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
PETRUCHIO:
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat,
PETRUCHIO:
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not,
PETRUCHIO:
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
PETRUCHIO:
I'll find about the making of the bed,
PETRUCHIO:
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
PETRUCHIO:
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets
PETRUCHIO:
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
PETRUCHIO:
That all is done in reverend care of her,
PETRUCHIO:
And in conclusion she shall watch all night
PETRUCHIO:
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
PETRUCHIO:
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
PETRUCHIO:
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,
PETRUCHIO:
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
PETRUCHIO:
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
PETRUCHIO:
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.
PETRUCHIO:
Exit
PETRUCHIO:
SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
PETRUCHIO:
Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO
TRANIO:
Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
TRANIO:
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
TRANIO:
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
HORTENSIO:
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
HORTENSIO:
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
HORTENSIO:
Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO
LUCENTIO:
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
BIANCA:
What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
LUCENTIO:
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
BIANCA:
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
LUCENTIO:
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
HORTENSIO:
Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
HORTENSIO:
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
HORTENSIO:
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
TRANIO:
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
TRANIO:
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
HORTENSIO:
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
HORTENSIO:
Nor a musician, as I seem to be,
HORTENSIO:
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
HORTENSIO:
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
HORTENSIO:
And makes a god of such a cullion
HORTENSIO:
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
TRANIO:
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
TRANIO:
Of your entire affection to Bianca,
TRANIO:
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
TRANIO:
I will with you, if you be so contented,
TRANIO:
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
HORTENSIO:
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
HORTENSIO:
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
HORTENSIO:
As one unworthy all the former favours
HORTENSIO:
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
TRANIO:
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
TRANIO:
Never to marry with her though she would entreat
TRANIO:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!
HORTENSIO:
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
HORTENSIO:
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
HORTENSIO:
I will be married to a wealthy widow,
HORTENSIO:
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
HORTENSIO:
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
HORTENSIO:
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
HORTENSIO:
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
HORTENSIO:
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
HORTENSIO:
In resolution as I swore before.
HORTENSIO:
Exit
TRANIO:
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
TRANIO:
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
TRANIO:
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
TRANIO:
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
BIANCA:
Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
TRANIO:
Mistress, we have.
LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.
TRANIO:
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
TRANIO:
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.
BIANCA:
God give him joy!
TRANIO:
Ay, and he'll tame her.
BIANCA:
He says so, Tranio.
TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
BIANCA:
The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
TRANIO:
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master,
TRANIO:
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
TRANIO:
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
TRANIO:
Enter BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I have watch'd so long
BIONDELLO:
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
BIONDELLO:
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
BIONDELLO:
Will serve the turn.
TRANIO:
What is he, Biondello?
BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
BIONDELLO:
I know not what, but format in apparel,
BIONDELLO:
In gait and countenance surely like a father.
LUCENTIO:
And what of him, Tranio?
TRANIO:
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
TRANIO:
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
TRANIO:
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
TRANIO:
As if he were the right Vincentio
TRANIO:
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
TRANIO:
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
TRANIO:
Enter a Pedant
Pedant:
God save you, sir!
TRANIO:
And you, sir! you are welcome.
TRANIO:
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
Pedant:
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two
Pedant:
But then up farther, and as for as Rome,
Pedant:
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?
Pedant:
Of Mantua.
TRANIO:
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
TRANIO:
And come to Padua, careless of your life?
Pedant:
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
TRANIO:
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
TRANIO:
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
TRANIO:
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
TRANIO:
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly
TRANIO:
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
TRANIO:
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so,
Pedant:
For I have bills for money by exchange
Pedant:
From Florence and must here deliver them.
TRANIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
TRANIO:
This will I do, and this I will advise you
TRANIO:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
Pedant:
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pedant:
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
TRANIO:
Among them know you one Vincentio?
Pedant:
I know him not, but I have heard of him,
Pedant:
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
TRANIO:
He is my father, sir, and, sooth to say,
TRANIO:
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
BIONDELLO:
[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster,
BIONDELLO:
and all one.
TRANIO:
To save your life in this extremity,
TRANIO:
This favour will I do you for his sake,
TRANIO:
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
TRANIO:
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
TRANIO:
His name and credit shall you undertake,
TRANIO:
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged
TRANIO:
Look that you take upon you as you should,
TRANIO:
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
TRANIO:
Till you have done your business in the city
TRANIO:
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
Pedant:
O sir, I do, and will repute you ever
Pedant:
The patron of my life and liberty.
TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter good.
TRANIO:
This, by the way, I let you understand,
TRANIO:
my father is here look'd for every day,
TRANIO:
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
TRANIO:
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here
TRANIO:
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you
TRANIO:
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
TRANIO:
Exeunt
TRANIO:
SCENE III. A room in PETRUCHIO'S house.
TRANIO:
Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO
GRUMIO:
No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life.
KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears
KATHARINA:
What, did he marry me to famish me?
KATHARINA:
Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
KATHARINA:
Upon entreaty have a present aims,
KATHARINA:
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity
KATHARINA:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
KATHARINA:
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
KATHARINA:
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
KATHARINA:
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed
KATHARINA:
And that which spites me more than all these wants,
KATHARINA:
He does it under name of perfect love,
KATHARINA:
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
KATHARINA:
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
KATHARINA:
I prithee go and get me some repast,
KATHARINA:
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
GRUMIO:
What say you to a neat's foot?
KATHARINA:
'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
GRUMIO:
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
GRUMIO:
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
KATHARINA:
I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.
GRUMIO:
I cannot tell, I fear 'tis choleric.
GRUMIO:
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
KATHARINA:
A dish that I do love to feed upon.
GRUMIO:
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
KATHARINA:
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
GRUMIO:
Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
GRUMIO:
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
KATHARINA:
Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
GRUMIO:
Why then, the mustard without the beef.
KATHARINA:
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
KATHARINA:
Beats him
KATHARINA:
That feed'st me with the very name of meat
KATHARINA:
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
KATHARINA:
That triumph thus upon my misery!
KATHARINA:
Go, get thee gone, I say.
KATHARINA:
Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat
PETRUCHIO:
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
HORTENSIO:
Mistress, what cheer?
KATHARINA:
Faith, as cold as can be.
PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.
PETRUCHIO:
Here love, thou see'st how diligent I am
PETRUCHIO:
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee
PETRUCHIO:
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
PETRUCHIO:
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not,
PETRUCHIO:
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
PETRUCHIO:
Here, take away this dish.
KATHARINA:
I pray you, let it stand.
PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks,
PETRUCHIO:
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
KATHARINA:
I thank you, sir.
HORTENSIO:
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
HORTENSIO:
Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
PETRUCHIO:
[Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.
PETRUCHIO:
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
PETRUCHIO:
Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
PETRUCHIO:
Will we return unto thy father's house
PETRUCHIO:
And revel it as bravely as the best,
PETRUCHIO:
With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
PETRUCHIO:
With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things,
PETRUCHIO:
With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
PETRUCHIO:
With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.
PETRUCHIO:
What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,
PETRUCHIO:
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
PETRUCHIO:
Enter Tailor
PETRUCHIO:
Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments,
PETRUCHIO:
Lay forth the gown.
PETRUCHIO:
Enter Haberdasher
PETRUCHIO:
What news with you, sir?
Haberdasher:
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was moulded on a porringer,
PETRUCHIO:
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy
PETRUCHIO:
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
PETRUCHIO:
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap
PETRUCHIO:
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
KATHARINA:
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
KATHARINA:
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these
PETRUCHIO:
When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
PETRUCHIO:
And not till then.
HORTENSIO:
[Aside]  That will not be in haste.
KATHARINA:
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,
KATHARINA:
And speak I will, I am no child, no babe
KATHARINA:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
KATHARINA:
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
KATHARINA:
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
KATHARINA:
Or else my heart concealing it will break,
KATHARINA:
And rather than it shall, I will be free
KATHARINA:
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, thou say'st true, it is a paltry cap,
PETRUCHIO:
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie
PETRUCHIO:
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.
KATHARINA:
Love me or love me not, I like the cap,
KATHARINA:
And it I will have, or I will have none.
KATHARINA:
Exit Haberdasher
PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
PETRUCHIO:
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
PETRUCHIO:
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon
PETRUCHIO:
What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
PETRUCHIO:
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
PETRUCHIO:
Like to a censer in a barber's shop
PETRUCHIO:
Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
HORTENSIO:
[Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
Tailor:
You bid me make it orderly and well,
Tailor:
According to the fashion and the time.
PETRUCHIO:
Marry, and did, but if you be remember'd,
PETRUCHIO:
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
PETRUCHIO:
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
PETRUCHIO:
For you shall hop without my custom, sir
PETRUCHIO:
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
KATHARINA:
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
KATHARINA:
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable
KATHARINA:
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee.
Tailor:
She says your worship means to make
Tailor:
a puppet of her.
PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
PETRUCHIO:
thou thimble,
PETRUCHIO:
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
PETRUCHIO:
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
PETRUCHIO:
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
PETRUCHIO:
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,
PETRUCHIO:
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
PETRUCHIO:
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
Tailor:
Your worship is deceived, the gown is made
Tailor:
Just as my master had direction
Tailor:
Grumio gave order how it should be done.
GRUMIO:
I gave him no order, I gave him the stuff.
Tailor:
But how did you desire it should be made?
GRUMIO:
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
Tailor:
But did you not request to have it cut?
GRUMIO:
Thou hast faced many things.
Tailor:
I have.
GRUMIO:
Face not me: thou hast braved many men, brave not
GRUMIO:
me, I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
GRUMIO:
thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown, but I did
GRUMIO:
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.
Tailor:
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify
PETRUCHIO:
Read it.
GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
Tailor:
[Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'
GRUMIO:
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
GRUMIO:
the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
GRUMIO:
of brown thread: I said a gown.
PETRUCHIO:
Proceed.
Tailor:
[Reads]  'With a small compassed cape:'
GRUMIO:
I confess the cape.
Tailor:
[Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve:'
GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.
Tailor:
[Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
PETRUCHIO:
Ay, there's the villany.
GRUMIO:
Error i' the bill, sir, error i' the bill.
GRUMIO:
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
GRUMIO:
sewed up again, and that I'll prove upon thee,
GRUMIO:
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
Tailor:
This is true that I say: an I had thee
Tailor:
in place where, thou shouldst know it.
GRUMIO:
I am for thee straight: take thou the
GRUMIO:
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.
HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.
PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
GRUMIO:
You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.
PETRUCHIO:
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
GRUMIO:
Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
GRUMIO:
gown for thy master's use!
PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
GRUMIO:
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for
GRUMIO:
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
GRUMIO:
O, fie, fie, fie!
PETRUCHIO:
[Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
PETRUCHIO:
Go take it hence, be gone, and say no more.
HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow
HORTENSIO:
Take no unkindness of his hasty words
HORTENSIO:
Away! I say, commend me to thy master.
HORTENSIO:
Exit Tailor
PETRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate, we will unto your father's
PETRUCHIO:
Even in these honest mean habiliments
PETRUCHIO:
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor,
PETRUCHIO:
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich,
PETRUCHIO:
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
PETRUCHIO:
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
PETRUCHIO:
What is the jay more precious than the lark,
PETRUCHIO:
Because his fathers are more beautiful?
PETRUCHIO:
Or is the adder better than the eel,
PETRUCHIO:
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
PETRUCHIO:
O, no, good Kate, neither art thou the worse
PETRUCHIO:
For this poor furniture and mean array.
PETRUCHIO:
if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me,
PETRUCHIO:
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
PETRUCHIO:
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
PETRUCHIO:
Go, call my men, and let us straight to him,
PETRUCHIO:
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end,
PETRUCHIO:
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
PETRUCHIO:
Let's see, I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
PETRUCHIO:
And well we may come there by dinner-time.
KATHARINA:
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,
KATHARINA:
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
PETRUCHIO:
It shall be seven ere I go to horse
PETRUCHIO:
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
PETRUCHIO:
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone
PETRUCHIO:
I will not go to-day, and ere I do,
PETRUCHIO:
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
HORTENSIO:
[Aside]  Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
HORTENSIO:
Exeunt
HORTENSIO:
SCENE IV. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
HORTENSIO:
Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO
TRANIO:
Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?
Pedant:
Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
Pedant:
Signior Baptista may remember me,
Pedant:
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Pedant:
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
TRANIO:
'Tis well, and hold your own, in any case,
TRANIO:
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
Pedant:
I warrant you.
Pedant:
Enter BIONDELLO
Pedant:
But, sir, here comes your boy,
Pedant:
'Twere good he were school'd.
TRANIO:
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
TRANIO:
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you
TRANIO:
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not me.
TRANIO:
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
BIONDELLO:
I told him that your father was at Venice,
BIONDELLO:
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
TRANIO:
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
TRANIO:
Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
TRANIO:
Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO
TRANIO:
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
TRANIO:
To the Pedant
TRANIO:
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of
TRANIO:
I pray you stand good father to me now,
TRANIO:
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
Pedant:
Soft son!
Pedant:
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
Pedant:
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Pedant:
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Pedant:
Of love between your daughter and himself
Pedant:
And, for the good report I hear of you
Pedant:
And for the love he beareth to your daughter
Pedant:
And she to him, to stay him not too long,
Pedant:
I am content, in a good father's care,
Pedant:
To have him match'd, and if you please to like
Pedant:
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Pedant:
Me shall you find ready and willing
Pedant:
With one consent to have her so bestow'd,
Pedant:
For curious I cannot be with you,
Pedant:
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
BAPTISTA:
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say
BAPTISTA:
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
BAPTISTA:
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
BAPTISTA:
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
BAPTISTA:
Or both dissemble deeply their affections
BAPTISTA:
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
BAPTISTA:
That like a father you will deal with him
BAPTISTA:
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
BAPTISTA:
The match is made, and all is done
BAPTISTA:
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
TRANIO:
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
TRANIO:
We be affied and such assurance ta'en
TRANIO:
As shall with either part's agreement stand?
BAPTISTA:
Not in my house, Lucentio, for, you know,
BAPTISTA:
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants
BAPTISTA:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still,
BAPTISTA:
And happily we might be interrupted.
TRANIO:
Then at my lodging, an it like you
TRANIO:
There doth my father lie, and there, this night,
TRANIO:
We'll pass the business privately and well.
TRANIO:
Send for your daughter by your servant here
TRANIO:
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
TRANIO:
The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
TRANIO:
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
BAPTISTA:
It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
BAPTISTA:
And bid Bianca make her ready straight,
BAPTISTA:
And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
BAPTISTA:
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
BAPTISTA:
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
BIONDELLO:
I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
TRANIO:
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
TRANIO:
Exit BIONDELLO
TRANIO:
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
TRANIO:
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer
TRANIO:
Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.
BAPTISTA:
I follow you.
BAPTISTA:
Exeunt TRANIO, Pedant, and BAPTISTA
BAPTISTA:
Re-enter BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO:
Cambio!
LUCENTIO:
What sayest thou, Biondello?
BIONDELLO:
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
LUCENTIO:
Biondello, what of that?
BIONDELLO:
Faith, nothing, but has left me here behind, to
BIONDELLO:
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
LUCENTIO:
I pray thee, moralize them.
BIONDELLO:
Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
BIONDELLO:
deceiving father of a deceitful son.
LUCENTIO:
And what of him?
BIONDELLO:
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
LUCENTIO:
And then?
BIONDELLO:
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
BIONDELLO:
command at all hours.
LUCENTIO:
And what of all this?
BIONDELLO:
I cannot tell, expect they are busied about a
BIONDELLO:
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
BIONDELLO:
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
BIONDELLO:
church, take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
BIONDELLO:
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
BIONDELLO:
I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
BIONDELLO:
ever and a day.
LUCENTIO:
Hearest thou, Biondello?
BIONDELLO:
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
BIONDELLO:
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
BIONDELLO:
stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
BIONDELLO:
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
BIONDELLO:
Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
BIONDELLO:
you come with your appendix.
BIONDELLO:
Exit
LUCENTIO:
I may, and will, if she be so contented
LUCENTIO:
She will be pleased, then wherefore should I doubt?
LUCENTIO:
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her
LUCENTIO:
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
LUCENTIO:
Exit
LUCENTIO:
SCENE V. A public road.
LUCENTIO:
Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants
PETRUCHIO:
Come on, i' God's name, once more toward our father's.
PETRUCHIO:
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
KATHARINA:
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
PETRUCHIO:
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
PETRUCHIO:
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
PETRUCHIO:
Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
PETRUCHIO:
Evermore cross'd and cross'd, nothing but cross'd!
HORTENSIO:
Say as he says, or we shall never go.
KATHARINA:
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
KATHARINA:
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please
KATHARINA:
An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
KATHARINA:
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon.
KATHARINA:
I know it is the moon.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.
KATHARINA:
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun
KATHARINA:
But sun it is not, when you say it is not,
KATHARINA:
And the moon changes even as your mind.
KATHARINA:
What you will have it named, even that it is,
KATHARINA:
And so it shall be so for Katharina.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.
PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
PETRUCHIO:
And not unluckily against the bias.
PETRUCHIO:
But, soft! company is coming here.
PETRUCHIO:
Enter VINCENTIO
PETRUCHIO:
To VINCENTIO
PETRUCHIO:
Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
PETRUCHIO:
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
PETRUCHIO:
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
PETRUCHIO:
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
PETRUCHIO:
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
PETRUCHIO:
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
PETRUCHIO:
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
PETRUCHIO:
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
HORTENSIO:
A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
KATHARINA:
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
KATHARINA:
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
KATHARINA:
Happy the parents of so fair a child,
KATHARINA:
Happier the man, whom favourable stars
KATHARINA:
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
PETRUCHIO:
Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad
PETRUCHIO:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
PETRUCHIO:
And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.
KATHARINA:
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
KATHARINA:
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
KATHARINA:
That everything I look on seemeth green
KATHARINA:
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father,
KATHARINA:
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
PETRUCHIO:
Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
PETRUCHIO:
Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
PETRUCHIO:
We shall be joyful of thy company.
VINCENTIO:
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
VINCENTIO:
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
VINCENTIO:
My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
VINCENTIO:
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
VINCENTIO:
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
PETRUCHIO:
What is his name?
VINCENTIO:
Lucentio, gentle sir.
PETRUCHIO:
Happily we met, the happier for thy son.
PETRUCHIO:
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
PETRUCHIO:
I may entitle thee my loving father
PETRUCHIO:
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
PETRUCHIO:
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
PETRUCHIO:
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
PETRUCHIO:
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth,
PETRUCHIO:
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
PETRUCHIO:
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
PETRUCHIO:
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
PETRUCHIO:
And wander we to see thy honest son,
PETRUCHIO:
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
VINCENTIO:
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
VINCENTIO:
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
VINCENTIO:
Upon the company you overtake?
HORTENSIO:
I do assure thee, father, so it is.
PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof,
PETRUCHIO:
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
PETRUCHIO:
Exeunt all but HORTENSIO
HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
HORTENSIO:
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
HORTENSIO:
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
HORTENSIO:
Exit
HORTENSIO:
ACT V
HORTENSIO:
SCENE I. Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house.
HORTENSIO:
GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA
BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
LUCENTIO:
I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
LUCENTIO:
at home, therefore leave us.
BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back, and
BIONDELLO:
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.
BIONDELLO:
Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO
GREMIO:
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
GREMIO:
Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO, with Attendants
PETRUCHIO:
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house
PETRUCHIO:
My father's bears more toward the market-place,
PETRUCHIO:
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
VINCENTIO:
You shall not choose but drink before you go
VINCENTIO:
I think I shall command your welcome here,
VINCENTIO:
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
VINCENTIO:
Knocks
GREMIO:
They're busy within, you were best knock louder.
GREMIO:
Pedant looks out of the window
Pedant:
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
VINCENTIO:
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
Pedant:
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
VINCENTIO:
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
VINCENTIO:
make merry withal?
Pedant:
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
Pedant:
need none, so long as I live.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
PETRUCHIO:
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
PETRUCHIO:
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
PETRUCHIO:
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
Pedant:
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
Pedant:
looking out at the window.
VINCENTIO:
Art thou his father?
Pedant:
Ay, sir, so his mother says, if I may believe her.
PETRUCHIO:
[To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman! why, this
PETRUCHIO:
is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.
Pedant:
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
Pedant:
cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
Pedant:
Re-enter BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO:
I have seen them in the church together: God send
BIONDELLO:
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
BIONDELLO:
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.
VINCENTIO:
[Seeing BIONDELLO]
VINCENTIO:
Come hither, crack-hemp.
BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.
VINCENTIO:
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
BIONDELLO:
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
BIONDELLO:
never saw you before in all my life.
VINCENTIO:
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
VINCENTIO:
thy master's father, Vincentio?
BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir
BIONDELLO:
see where he looks out of the window.
VINCENTIO:
Is't so, indeed.
VINCENTIO:
Beats BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
BIONDELLO:
Exit
Pedant:
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
Pedant:
Exit from above
PETRUCHIO:
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
PETRUCHIO:
this controversy.
PETRUCHIO:
They retire
PETRUCHIO:
Re-enter Pedant below, TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants
TRANIO:
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
VINCENTIO:
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
VINCENTIO:
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
VINCENTIO:
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
VINCENTIO:
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
VINCENTIO:
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
VINCENTIO:
the university.
TRANIO:
How now! what's the matter?
BAPTISTA:
What, is the man lunatic?
TRANIO:
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
TRANIO:
habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
TRANIO:
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
TRANIO:
thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
VINCENTIO:
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
BAPTISTA:
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
BAPTISTA:
you think is his name?
VINCENTIO:
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
VINCENTIO:
him up ever since he was three years old, and his
VINCENTIO:
name is Tranio.
Pedant:
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
Pedant:
mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
VINCENTIO:
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
VINCENTIO:
on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
VINCENTIO:
son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
TRANIO:
Call forth an officer.
TRANIO:
Enter one with an Officer
TRANIO:
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
TRANIO:
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the gaol!
GREMIO:
Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
BAPTISTA:
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
GREMIO:
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
GREMIO:
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
GREMIO:
is the right Vincentio.
Pedant:
Swear, if thou darest.
GREMIO:
Nay, I dare not swear it.
TRANIO:
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
GREMIO:
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
BAPTISTA:
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
VINCENTIO:
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
VINCENTIO:
monstrous villain!
VINCENTIO:
Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA
BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
BIONDELLO:
forswear him, or else we are all undone.
LUCENTIO:
[Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.
VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son?
VINCENTIO:
Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast as may be
BIANCA:
Pardon, dear father.
BAPTISTA:
How hast thou offended?
BAPTISTA:
Where is Lucentio?
LUCENTIO:
Here's Lucentio,
LUCENTIO:
Right son to the right Vincentio,
LUCENTIO:
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
LUCENTIO:
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
GREMIO:
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
VINCENTIO:
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
VINCENTIO:
That faced and braved me in this matter so?
BAPTISTA:
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
BIANCA:
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
LUCENTIO:
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
LUCENTIO:
While he did bear my countenance in the town,
LUCENTIO:
And happily I have arrived at the last
LUCENTIO:
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
LUCENTIO:
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to,
LUCENTIO:
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
VINCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
VINCENTIO:
me to the gaol.
BAPTISTA:
But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
BAPTISTA:
without asking my good will?
VINCENTIO:
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you, go to: but
VINCENTIO:
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
VINCENTIO:
Exit
BAPTISTA:
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
BAPTISTA:
Exit
LUCENTIO:
Look not pale, Bianca, thy father will not frown.
LUCENTIO:
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
GREMIO:
My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest,
GREMIO:
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
GREMIO:
Exit
KATHARINA:
Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
PETRUCHIO:
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
KATHARINA:
What, in the midst of the street?
PETRUCHIO:
What, art thou ashamed of me?
KATHARINA:
No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
KATHARINA:
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
PETRUCHIO:
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate
PETRUCHIO:
Better once than never, for never too late.
PETRUCHIO:
Exeunt
PETRUCHIO:
SCENE II. Padua. LUCENTIO'S house.
PETRUCHIO:
Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant,  LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO,  and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet
LUCENTIO:
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree
LUCENTIO:
And time it is, when raging war is done,
LUCENTIO:
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
LUCENTIO:
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
LUCENTIO:
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
LUCENTIO:
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
LUCENTIO:
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
LUCENTIO:
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house
LUCENTIO:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
LUCENTIO:
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down,
LUCENTIO:
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
PETRUCHIO:
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
HORTENSIO:
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
Widow:
Then never trust me, if I be afeard.
PETRUCHIO:
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense
PETRUCHIO:
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
Widow:
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
PETRUCHIO:
Roundly replied.
KATHARINA:
Mistress, how mean you that?
Widow:
Thus I conceive by him.
PETRUCHIO:
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
HORTENSIO:
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
KATHARINA:
'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
KATHARINA:
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
Widow:
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Widow:
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe
Widow:
And now you know my meaning,
KATHARINA:
A very mean meaning.
Widow:
Right, I mean you.
KATHARINA:
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
PETRUCHIO:
To her, Kate!
HORTENSIO:
To her, widow!
PETRUCHIO:
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
HORTENSIO:
That's my office.
PETRUCHIO:
Spoke like an officer, ha' to thee, lad!
PETRUCHIO:
Drinks to HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA:
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
GREMIO:
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
BIANCA:
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
BIANCA:
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?
BIANCA:
Ay, but not frighted me, therefore I'll sleep again.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
PETRUCHIO:
Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
BIANCA:
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
BIANCA:
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
BIANCA:
You are welcome all.
BIANCA:
Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow
PETRUCHIO:
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
PETRUCHIO:
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not,
PETRUCHIO:
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
TRANIO:
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
TRANIO:
Which runs himself and catches for his master.
PETRUCHIO:
A good swift simile, but something currish.
TRANIO:
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself
TRANIO:
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
LUCENTIO:
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
HORTENSIO:
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
PETRUCHIO:
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess,
PETRUCHIO:
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
PETRUCHIO:
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
BAPTISTA:
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
BAPTISTA:
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
PETRUCHIO:
Let's each one send unto his wife,
PETRUCHIO:
And he whose wife is most obedient
PETRUCHIO:
To come at first when he doth send for her,
PETRUCHIO:
Shall win the wager which we will propose.
HORTENSIO:
Content. What is the wager?
LUCENTIO:
Twenty crowns.
PETRUCHIO:
Twenty crowns!
PETRUCHIO:
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
PETRUCHIO:
But twenty times so much upon my wife.
LUCENTIO:
A hundred then.
HORTENSIO:
Content.
PETRUCHIO:
A match! 'tis done.
HORTENSIO:
Who shall begin?
LUCENTIO:
That will I.
LUCENTIO:
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
BIONDELLO:
I go.
BIONDELLO:
Exit
BAPTISTA:
Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.
LUCENTIO:
I'll have no halves, I'll bear it all myself.
LUCENTIO:
Re-enter BIONDELLO
LUCENTIO:
How now! what news?
BIONDELLO:
Sir, my mistress sends you word
BIONDELLO:
That she is busy and she cannot come.
PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
PETRUCHIO:
Is that an answer?
GREMIO:
Ay, and a kind one too
GREMIO:
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.
HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
HORTENSIO:
To come to me forthwith.
HORTENSIO:
Exit BIONDELLO
PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her!
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, then she must needs come.
HORTENSIO:
I am afraid, sir,
HORTENSIO:
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
HORTENSIO:
Re-enter BIONDELLO
HORTENSIO:
Now, where's my wife?
BIONDELLO:
She says you have some goodly jest in hand
BIONDELLO:
She will not come: she bids you come to her.
PETRUCHIO:
Worse and worse, she will not come! O vile,
PETRUCHIO:
Intolerable, not to be endured!
PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress,
PETRUCHIO:
Say, I command her to come to me.
PETRUCHIO:
Exit GRUMIO
HORTENSIO:
I know her answer.
PETRUCHIO:
What?
HORTENSIO:
She will not.
PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
BAPTISTA:
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
BAPTISTA:
Re-enter KATARINA
KATHARINA:
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
PETRUCHIO:
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
KATHARINA:
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
PETRUCHIO:
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
PETRUCHIO:
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
PETRUCHIO:
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
PETRUCHIO:
Exit KATHARINA
LUCENTIO:
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
HORTENSIO:
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
PETRUCHIO:
Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
PETRUCHIO:
And awful rule and right supremacy,
PETRUCHIO:
And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?
BAPTISTA:
Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
BAPTISTA:
The wager thou hast won, and I will add
BAPTISTA:
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns,
BAPTISTA:
Another dowry to another daughter,
BAPTISTA:
For she is changed, as she had never been.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will win my wager better yet
PETRUCHIO:
And show more sign of her obedience,
PETRUCHIO:
Her new-built virtue and obedience.
PETRUCHIO:
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
PETRUCHIO:
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
PETRUCHIO:
Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow
PETRUCHIO:
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not
PETRUCHIO:
Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.
Widow:
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
Widow:
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
BIANCA:
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
LUCENTIO:
I would your duty were as foolish too
LUCENTIO:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
LUCENTIO:
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
BIANCA:
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
PETRUCHIO:
Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
PETRUCHIO:
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
Widow:
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
PETRUCHIO:
Come on, I say, and first begin with her.
Widow:
She shall not.
PETRUCHIO:
I say she shall: and first begin with her.
KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
KATHARINA:
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
KATHARINA:
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor
KATHARINA:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
KATHARINA:
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
KATHARINA:
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
KATHARINA:
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
KATHARINA:
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,
KATHARINA:
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
KATHARINA:
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
KATHARINA:
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
KATHARINA:
Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,
KATHARINA:
And for thy maintenance commits his body
KATHARINA:
To painful labour both by sea and land,
KATHARINA:
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
KATHARINA:
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,
KATHARINA:
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
KATHARINA:
But love, fair looks and true obedience,
KATHARINA:
Too little payment for so great a debt.
KATHARINA:
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
KATHARINA:
Even such a woman oweth to her husband,
KATHARINA:
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
KATHARINA:
And not obedient to his honest will,
KATHARINA:
What is she but a foul contending rebel
KATHARINA:
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
KATHARINA:
I am ashamed that women are so simple
KATHARINA:
To offer war where they should kneel for peace,
KATHARINA:
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
KATHARINA:
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
KATHARINA:
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
KATHARINA:
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
KATHARINA:
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
KATHARINA:
Should well agree with our external parts?
KATHARINA:
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
KATHARINA:
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
KATHARINA:
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
KATHARINA:
To bandy word for word and frown for frown,
KATHARINA:
But now I see our lances are but straws,
KATHARINA:
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
KATHARINA:
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
KATHARINA:
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
KATHARINA:
And place your hands below your husband's foot
KATHARINA:
In token of which duty, if he please,
KATHARINA:
My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
LUCENTIO:
Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
VINCENTIO:
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
LUCENTIO:
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
PETRUCHIO:
We three are married, but you two are sped.
PETRUCHIO:
To LUCENTIO
PETRUCHIO:
'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white,
PETRUCHIO:
And, being a winner, God give you good night!
PETRUCHIO:
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy ways, thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
LUCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
LUCENTIO:
Exeunt
