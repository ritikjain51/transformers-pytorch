ACT I
LUCIUS:
PROLOGUE
LUCIUS:
In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
LUCIUS:
The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,
LUCIUS:
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
LUCIUS:
Fraught with the ministers and instruments
LUCIUS:
Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore
LUCIUS:
Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay
LUCIUS:
Put forth toward Phrygia, and their vow is made
LUCIUS:
To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures
LUCIUS:
The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,
LUCIUS:
With wanton Paris sleeps, and that's the quarrel.
LUCIUS:
To Tenedos they come,
LUCIUS:
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
LUCIUS:
Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
LUCIUS:
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
LUCIUS:
Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,
LUCIUS:
Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,
LUCIUS:
And Antenorides, with massy staples
LUCIUS:
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
LUCIUS:
Sperr up the sons of Troy.
LUCIUS:
Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,
LUCIUS:
On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
LUCIUS:
Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come
LUCIUS:
A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
LUCIUS:
Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
LUCIUS:
In like conditions as our argument,
LUCIUS:
To tell you, fair beholders, that our play
LUCIUS:
Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
LUCIUS:
Beginning in the middle, starting thence away
LUCIUS:
To what may be digested in a play.
LUCIUS:
Like or find fault, do as your pleasures are
LUCIUS:
Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.
LUCIUS:
SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.
LUCIUS:
Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS
TROILUS:
Call here my varlet, I'll unarm again
TROILUS:
Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
TROILUS:
That find such cruel battle here within?
TROILUS:
Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
TROILUS:
Let him to field, Troilus, alas! hath none.
PANDARUS:
Will this gear ne'er be mended?
TROILUS:
The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
TROILUS:
Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant,
TROILUS:
But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
TROILUS:
Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
TROILUS:
Less valiant than the virgin in the night
TROILUS:
And skilless as unpractised infancy.
PANDARUS:
Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
PANDARUS:
I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
PANDARUS:
have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
TROILUS:
Have I not tarried?
PANDARUS:
Ay, the grinding, but you must tarry
PANDARUS:
the bolting.
TROILUS:
Have I not tarried?
PANDARUS:
Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.
TROILUS:
Still have I tarried.
PANDARUS:
Ay, to the leavening, but here's yet in the word
PANDARUS:
'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the
PANDARUS:
heating of the oven and the baking, nay, you must
PANDARUS:
stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.
TROILUS:
Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
TROILUS:
Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
TROILUS:
At Priam's royal table do I sit,
TROILUS:
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--
TROILUS:
So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?
PANDARUS:
Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw
PANDARUS:
her look, or any woman else.
TROILUS:
I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
TROILUS:
As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
TROILUS:
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
TROILUS:
I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
TROILUS:
Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
TROILUS:
But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
TROILUS:
Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
PANDARUS:
An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
PANDARUS:
well, go to--there were no more comparison between
PANDARUS:
the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman, I
PANDARUS:
would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would
PANDARUS:
somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I
PANDARUS:
will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--
TROILUS:
O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
TROILUS:
When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
TROILUS:
Reply not in how many fathoms deep
TROILUS:
They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
TROILUS:
In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair,'
TROILUS:
Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
TROILUS:
Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
TROILUS:
Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
TROILUS:
In whose comparison all whites are ink,
TROILUS:
Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
TROILUS:
The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
TROILUS:
Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,
TROILUS:
As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her,
TROILUS:
But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
TROILUS:
Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
TROILUS:
The knife that made it.
PANDARUS:
I speak no more than truth.
TROILUS:
Thou dost not speak so much.
PANDARUS:
Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is
PANDARUS:
if she be fair, 'tis the better for her, an she be
PANDARUS:
not, she has the mends in her own hands.
TROILUS:
Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!
PANDARUS:
I have had my labour for my travail, ill-thought on of
PANDARUS:
her and ill-thought on of you, gone between and
PANDARUS:
between, but small thanks for my labour.
TROILUS:
What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?
PANDARUS:
Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair
PANDARUS:
as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as
PANDARUS:
fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
PANDARUS:
I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor, 'tis all one to me.
TROILUS:
Say I she is not fair?
PANDARUS:
I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
PANDARUS:
stay behind her father, let her to the Greeks, and so
PANDARUS:
I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,
PANDARUS:
I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.
TROILUS:
Pandarus,--
PANDARUS:
Not I.
TROILUS:
Sweet Pandarus,--
PANDARUS:
Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I
PANDARUS:
found it, and there an end.
PANDARUS:
Exit PANDARUS. An alarum
TROILUS:
Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
TROILUS:
Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
TROILUS:
When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
TROILUS:
I cannot fight upon this argument,
TROILUS:
It is too starved a subject for my sword.
TROILUS:
But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
TROILUS:
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar,
TROILUS:
And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
TROILUS:
As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
TROILUS:
Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
TROILUS:
What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
TROILUS:
Her bed is India, there she lies, a pearl
TROILUS:
Between our Ilium and where she resides,
TROILUS:
Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,
TROILUS:
Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
TROILUS:
Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.
TROILUS:
Alarum. Enter AENEAS
AENEAS:
How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?
TROILUS:
Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
TROILUS:
For womanish it is to be from thence.
TROILUS:
What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?
AENEAS:
That Paris is returned home and hurt.
TROILUS:
By whom, AEneas?
AENEAS:
Troilus, by Menelaus.
TROILUS:
Let Paris bleed, 'tis but a scar to scorn,
TROILUS:
Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
TROILUS:
Alarum
AENEAS:
Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!
TROILUS:
Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
TROILUS:
But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
AENEAS:
In all swift haste.
TROILUS:
Come, go we then together.
TROILUS:
Exeunt
TROILUS:
SCENE II. The Same. A street.
TROILUS:
Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER
CRESSIDA:
Who were those went by?
ALEXANDER:
Queen Hecuba and Helen.
CRESSIDA:
And whither go they?
ALEXANDER:
Up to the eastern tower,
ALEXANDER:
Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
ALEXANDER:
To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
ALEXANDER:
Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved
ALEXANDER:
He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,
ALEXANDER:
And, like as there were husbandry in war,
ALEXANDER:
Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
ALEXANDER:
And to the field goes he, where every flower
ALEXANDER:
Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
ALEXANDER:
In Hector's wrath.
CRESSIDA:
What was his cause of anger?
ALEXANDER:
The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
ALEXANDER:
A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector,
ALEXANDER:
They call him Ajax.
CRESSIDA:
Good, and what of him?
ALEXANDER:
They say he is a very man per se,
ALEXANDER:
And stands alone.
CRESSIDA:
So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
ALEXANDER:
This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their
ALEXANDER:
particular additions, he is as valiant as the lion,
ALEXANDER:
churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
ALEXANDER:
into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
ALEXANDER:
valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
ALEXANDER:
discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
ALEXANDER:
hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
ALEXANDER:
carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
ALEXANDER:
cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
ALEXANDER:
joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
ALEXANDER:
that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
ALEXANDER:
or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
CRESSIDA:
But how should this man, that makes
CRESSIDA:
me smile, make Hector angry?
ALEXANDER:
They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
ALEXANDER:
struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
ALEXANDER:
ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
CRESSIDA:
Who comes here?
ALEXANDER:
Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
ALEXANDER:
Enter PANDARUS
CRESSIDA:
Hector's a gallant man.
ALEXANDER:
As may be in the world, lady.
PANDARUS:
What's that? what's that?
CRESSIDA:
Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
PANDARUS:
Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?
PANDARUS:
Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When
PANDARUS:
were you at Ilium?
CRESSIDA:
This morning, uncle.
PANDARUS:
What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
PANDARUS:
armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
PANDARUS:
up, was she?
CRESSIDA:
Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
PANDARUS:
Even so: Hector was stirring early.
CRESSIDA:
That were we talking of, and of his anger.
PANDARUS:
Was he angry?
CRESSIDA:
So he says here.
PANDARUS:
True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay
PANDARUS:
about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's
PANDARUS:
Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
PANDARUS:
heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
CRESSIDA:
What, is he angry too?
PANDARUS:
Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
CRESSIDA:
O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
PANDARUS:
What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a
PANDARUS:
man if you see him?
CRESSIDA:
Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
PANDARUS:
Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
Then you say as I say, for, I am sure, he is not Hector.
PANDARUS:
No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
CRESSIDA:
'Tis just to each of them, he is himself.
PANDARUS:
Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.
CRESSIDA:
So he is.
PANDARUS:
Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.
CRESSIDA:
He is not Hector.
PANDARUS:
Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
PANDARUS:
himself! Well, the gods are above, time must friend
PANDARUS:
or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were
PANDARUS:
in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
Excuse me.
PANDARUS:
He is elder.
CRESSIDA:
Pardon me, pardon me.
PANDARUS:
Th' other's not come to't, you shall tell me another
PANDARUS:
tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not
PANDARUS:
have his wit this year.
CRESSIDA:
He shall not need it, if he have his own.
PANDARUS:
Nor his qualities.
CRESSIDA:
No matter.
PANDARUS:
Nor his beauty.
CRESSIDA:
'Twould not become him, his own's better.
PANDARUS:
You have no judgment, niece: Helen
PANDARUS:
herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for
PANDARUS:
a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--
PANDARUS:
not brown neither,--
CRESSIDA:
No, but brown.
PANDARUS:
'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
CRESSIDA:
To say the truth, true and not true.
PANDARUS:
She praised his complexion above Paris.
CRESSIDA:
Why, Paris hath colour enough.
PANDARUS:
So he has.
CRESSIDA:
Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
CRESSIDA:
him above, his complexion is higher than his, he
CRESSIDA:
having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
CRESSIDA:
flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
CRESSIDA:
lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
CRESSIDA:
a copper nose.
PANDARUS:
I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
CRESSIDA:
Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
PANDARUS:
Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other
PANDARUS:
day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he
PANDARUS:
has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--
CRESSIDA:
Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
CRESSIDA:
particulars therein to a total.
PANDARUS:
Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within
PANDARUS:
three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.
CRESSIDA:
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
PANDARUS:
But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
PANDARUS:
and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
CRESSIDA:
Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
PANDARUS:
Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling
PANDARUS:
becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
CRESSIDA:
O, he smiles valiantly.
PANDARUS:
Does he not?
CRESSIDA:
O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.
PANDARUS:
Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen
PANDARUS:
loves Troilus,--
CRESSIDA:
Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll
CRESSIDA:
prove it so.
PANDARUS:
Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem
PANDARUS:
an addle egg.
CRESSIDA:
If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
CRESSIDA:
head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.
PANDARUS:
I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled
PANDARUS:
his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I
PANDARUS:
must needs confess,--
CRESSIDA:
Without the rack.
PANDARUS:
And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
CRESSIDA:
Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
PANDARUS:
But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
PANDARUS:
that her eyes ran o'er.
CRESSIDA:
With mill-stones.
PANDARUS:
And Cassandra laughed.
CRESSIDA:
But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
CRESSIDA:
her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
PANDARUS:
And Hector laughed.
CRESSIDA:
At what was all this laughing?
PANDARUS:
Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.
CRESSIDA:
An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
CRESSIDA:
too.
PANDARUS:
They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
CRESSIDA:
What was his answer?
PANDARUS:
Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your
PANDARUS:
chin, and one of them is white.
CRESSIDA:
This is her question.
PANDARUS:
That's true, make no question of that. 'Two and
PANDARUS:
fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white
PANDARUS:
hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'
PANDARUS:
'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,
PANDARUS:
my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't
PANDARUS:
out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!
PANDARUS:
and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the
PANDARUS:
rest so laughed, that it passed.
CRESSIDA:
So let it now, for it has been while going by.
PANDARUS:
Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday, think on't.
CRESSIDA:
So I do.
PANDARUS:
I'll be sworn 'tis true, he will weep you, an 'twere
PANDARUS:
a man born in April.
CRESSIDA:
And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
CRESSIDA:
against May.
CRESSIDA:
A retreat sounded
PANDARUS:
Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
PANDARUS:
stand up here, and see them as they pass toward
PANDARUS:
Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.
CRESSIDA:
At your pleasure.
PANDARUS:
Here, here, here's an excellent place, here we may
PANDARUS:
see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
PANDARUS:
names as they pass by, but mark Troilus above the rest.
CRESSIDA:
Speak not so loud.
CRESSIDA:
AENEAS passes
PANDARUS:
That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of
PANDARUS:
the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark
PANDARUS:
Troilus, you shall see anon.
PANDARUS:
ANTENOR passes
CRESSIDA:
Who's that?
PANDARUS:
That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you,
PANDARUS:
and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest
PANDARUS:
judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.
PANDARUS:
When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
PANDARUS:
he see me, you shall see him nod at me.
CRESSIDA:
Will he give you the nod?
PANDARUS:
You shall see.
CRESSIDA:
If he do, the rich shall have more.
CRESSIDA:
HECTOR passes
PANDARUS:
That's Hector, that, that, look you, that, there's a
PANDARUS:
fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,
PANDARUS:
niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
PANDARUS:
a countenance! is't not a brave man?
CRESSIDA:
O, a brave man!
PANDARUS:
Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you
PANDARUS:
what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do
PANDARUS:
you see? look you there: there's no jesting,
PANDARUS:
there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say
PANDARUS:
there be hacks!
CRESSIDA:
Be those with swords?
PANDARUS:
Swords! any thing, he cares not, an the devil come
PANDARUS:
to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's
PANDARUS:
heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
PANDARUS:
PARIS passes
PANDARUS:
Look ye yonder, niece, is't not a gallant man too,
PANDARUS:
is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came
PANDARUS:
hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do
PANDARUS:
Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see
PANDARUS:
Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
PANDARUS:
HELENUS passes
CRESSIDA:
Who's that?
PANDARUS:
That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
PANDARUS:
Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
CRESSIDA:
Can Helenus fight, uncle?
PANDARUS:
Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I
PANDARUS:
marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
PANDARUS:
people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
CRESSIDA:
What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
CRESSIDA:
TROILUS passes
PANDARUS:
Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
PANDARUS:
there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the
PANDARUS:
prince of chivalry!
CRESSIDA:
Peace, for shame, peace!
PANDARUS:
Mark him, note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon
PANDARUS:
him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and
PANDARUS:
his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,
PANDARUS:
and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
PANDARUS:
three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!
PANDARUS:
Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,
PANDARUS:
he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
PANDARUS:
Paris is dirt to him, and, I warrant, Helen, to
PANDARUS:
change, would give an eye to boot.
CRESSIDA:
Here come more.
CRESSIDA:
Forces pass
PANDARUS:
Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
PANDARUS:
porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
PANDARUS:
eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles
PANDARUS:
are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
PANDARUS:
rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
PANDARUS:
all Greece.
CRESSIDA:
There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.
PANDARUS:
Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.
CRESSIDA:
Well, well.
PANDARUS:
'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have
PANDARUS:
you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
PANDARUS:
birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
PANDARUS:
learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,
PANDARUS:
and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
CRESSIDA:
Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date
CRESSIDA:
in the pie, for then the man's date's out.
PANDARUS:
You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
PANDARUS:
lie.
CRESSIDA:
Upon my back, to defend my belly, upon my wit, to
CRESSIDA:
defend my wiles, upon my secrecy, to defend mine
CRESSIDA:
honesty, my mask, to defend my beauty, and you, to
CRESSIDA:
defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
CRESSIDA:
thousand watches.
PANDARUS:
Say one of your watches.
CRESSIDA:
Nay, I'll watch you for that, and that's one of the
CRESSIDA:
chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
CRESSIDA:
not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
CRESSIDA:
the blow, unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
CRESSIDA:
past watching.
PANDARUS:
You are such another!
PANDARUS:
Enter Troilus's Boy
Boy:
Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
PANDARUS:
Where?
Boy:
At your own house, there he unarms him.
PANDARUS:
Good boy, tell him I come.
PANDARUS:
Exit boy
PANDARUS:
I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
CRESSIDA:
Adieu, uncle.
PANDARUS:
I'll be with you, niece, by and by.
CRESSIDA:
To bring, uncle?
PANDARUS:
Ay, a token from Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
By the same token, you are a bawd.
CRESSIDA:
Exit PANDARUS
CRESSIDA:
Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
CRESSIDA:
He offers in another's enterprise,
CRESSIDA:
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
CRESSIDA:
Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be,
CRESSIDA:
Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing
CRESSIDA:
Things won are done, joy's soul lies in the doing.
CRESSIDA:
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this
CRESSIDA:
Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is
CRESSIDA:
That she was never yet that ever knew
CRESSIDA:
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
CRESSIDA:
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach
CRESSIDA:
Achievement is command, ungain'd, beseech
CRESSIDA:
Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
CRESSIDA:
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
CRESSIDA:
Exeunt
CRESSIDA:
SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.
CRESSIDA:
Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, MENELAUS, and others
AGAMEMNON:
Princes,
AGAMEMNON:
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
AGAMEMNON:
The ample proposition that hope makes
AGAMEMNON:
In all designs begun on earth below
AGAMEMNON:
Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
AGAMEMNON:
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
AGAMEMNON:
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
AGAMEMNON:
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
AGAMEMNON:
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
AGAMEMNON:
Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
AGAMEMNON:
That we come short of our suppose so far
AGAMEMNON:
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand,
AGAMEMNON:
Sith every action that hath gone before,
AGAMEMNON:
Whereof we have record, trial did draw
AGAMEMNON:
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
AGAMEMNON:
And that unbodied figure of the thought
AGAMEMNON:
That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
AGAMEMNON:
Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
AGAMEMNON:
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
AGAMEMNON:
But the protractive trials of great Jove
AGAMEMNON:
To find persistive constancy in men
AGAMEMNON:
The fineness of which metal is not found
AGAMEMNON:
In fortune's love, for then the bold and coward,
AGAMEMNON:
The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
AGAMEMNON:
The hard and soft seem all affined and kin
AGAMEMNON:
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
AGAMEMNON:
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
AGAMEMNON:
Puffing at all, winnows the light away,
AGAMEMNON:
And what hath mass or matter, by itself
AGAMEMNON:
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
NESTOR:
With due observance of thy godlike seat,
NESTOR:
Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
NESTOR:
Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
NESTOR:
Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
NESTOR:
How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
NESTOR:
Upon her patient breast, making their way
NESTOR:
With those of nobler bulk!
NESTOR:
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
NESTOR:
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
NESTOR:
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
NESTOR:
Bounding between the two moist elements,
NESTOR:
Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
NESTOR:
Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
NESTOR:
Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,
NESTOR:
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
NESTOR:
Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
NESTOR:
In storms of fortune, for in her ray and brightness
NESTOR:
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
NESTOR:
Than by the tiger, but when the splitting wind
NESTOR:
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
NESTOR:
And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
NESTOR:
As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
NESTOR:
And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
NESTOR:
Retorts to chiding fortune.
ULYSSES:
Agamemnon,
ULYSSES:
Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
ULYSSES:
Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.
ULYSSES:
In whom the tempers and the minds of all
ULYSSES:
Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
ULYSSES:
Besides the applause and approbation To which,
ULYSSES:
To AGAMEMNON
ULYSSES:
most mighty for thy place and sway,
ULYSSES:
To NESTOR
ULYSSES:
And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
ULYSSES:
I give to both your speeches, which were such
ULYSSES:
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
ULYSSES:
Should hold up high in brass, and such again
ULYSSES:
As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
ULYSSES:
Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
ULYSSES:
On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
ULYSSES:
To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
ULYSSES:
Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.
AGAMEMNON:
Speak, prince of Ithaca, and be't of less expect
AGAMEMNON:
That matter needless, of importless burden,
AGAMEMNON:
Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
AGAMEMNON:
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
AGAMEMNON:
We shall hear music, wit and oracle.
ULYSSES:
Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
ULYSSES:
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
ULYSSES:
But for these instances.
ULYSSES:
The specialty of rule hath been neglected
ULYSSES:
And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
ULYSSES:
Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
ULYSSES:
When that the general is not like the hive
ULYSSES:
To whom the foragers shall all repair,
ULYSSES:
What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
ULYSSES:
The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
ULYSSES:
The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
ULYSSES:
Observe degree, priority and place,
ULYSSES:
Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
ULYSSES:
Office and custom, in all line of order,
ULYSSES:
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
ULYSSES:
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
ULYSSES:
Amidst the other, whose medicinable eye
ULYSSES:
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
ULYSSES:
And posts, like the commandment of a king,
ULYSSES:
Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
ULYSSES:
In evil mixture to disorder wander,
ULYSSES:
What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
ULYSSES:
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
ULYSSES:
Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
ULYSSES:
Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
ULYSSES:
The unity and married calm of states
ULYSSES:
Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,
ULYSSES:
Which is the ladder to all high designs,
ULYSSES:
Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,
ULYSSES:
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
ULYSSES:
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
ULYSSES:
The primogenitive and due of birth,
ULYSSES:
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
ULYSSES:
But by degree, stand in authentic place?
ULYSSES:
Take but degree away, untune that string,
ULYSSES:
And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
ULYSSES:
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
ULYSSES:
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
ULYSSES:
And make a sop of all this solid globe
ULYSSES:
Strength should be lord of imbecility,
ULYSSES:
And the rude son should strike his father dead
ULYSSES:
Force should be right, or rather, right and wrong,
ULYSSES:
Between whose endless jar justice resides,
ULYSSES:
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
ULYSSES:
Then every thing includes itself in power,
ULYSSES:
Power into will, will into appetite,
ULYSSES:
And appetite, an universal wolf,
ULYSSES:
So doubly seconded with will and power,
ULYSSES:
Must make perforce an universal prey,
ULYSSES:
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
ULYSSES:
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
ULYSSES:
Follows the choking.
ULYSSES:
And this neglection of degree it is
ULYSSES:
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
ULYSSES:
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
ULYSSES:
By him one step below, he by the next,
ULYSSES:
That next by him beneath, so every step,
ULYSSES:
Exampled by the first pace that is sick
ULYSSES:
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
ULYSSES:
Of pale and bloodless emulation
ULYSSES:
And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
ULYSSES:
Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
ULYSSES:
Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
NESTOR:
Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
NESTOR:
The fever whereof all our power is sick.
AGAMEMNON:
The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
AGAMEMNON:
What is the remedy?
ULYSSES:
The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
ULYSSES:
The sinew and the forehand of our host,
ULYSSES:
Having his ear full of his airy fame,
ULYSSES:
Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
ULYSSES:
Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
ULYSSES:
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
ULYSSES:
Breaks scurril jests,
ULYSSES:
And with ridiculous and awkward action,
ULYSSES:
Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
ULYSSES:
He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
ULYSSES:
Thy topless deputation he puts on,
ULYSSES:
And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
ULYSSES:
Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
ULYSSES:
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
ULYSSES:
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--
ULYSSES:
Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
ULYSSES:
He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
ULYSSES:
'Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquared,
ULYSSES:
Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd
ULYSSES:
Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
ULYSSES:
The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
ULYSSES:
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,
ULYSSES:
Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
ULYSSES:
Now play me Nestor, hem, and stroke thy beard,
ULYSSES:
As he being drest to some oration.'
ULYSSES:
That's done, as near as the extremest ends
ULYSSES:
Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife
ULYSSES:
Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
ULYSSES:
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
ULYSSES:
Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
ULYSSES:
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
ULYSSES:
Must be the scene of mirth, to cough and spit,
ULYSSES:
And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
ULYSSES:
Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
ULYSSES:
Sir Valour dies, cries 'O, enough, Patroclus,
ULYSSES:
Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
ULYSSES:
In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,
ULYSSES:
All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
ULYSSES:
Severals and generals of grace exact,
ULYSSES:
Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
ULYSSES:
Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
ULYSSES:
Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
ULYSSES:
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
NESTOR:
And in the imitation of these twain--
NESTOR:
Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
NESTOR:
With an imperial voice--many are infect.
NESTOR:
Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
NESTOR:
In such a rein, in full as proud a place
NESTOR:
As broad Achilles, keeps his tent like him,
NESTOR:
Makes factious feasts, rails on our state of war,
NESTOR:
Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
NESTOR:
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
NESTOR:
To match us in comparisons with dirt,
NESTOR:
To weaken and discredit our exposure,
NESTOR:
How rank soever rounded in with danger.
ULYSSES:
They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
ULYSSES:
Count wisdom as no member of the war,
ULYSSES:
Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
ULYSSES:
But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
ULYSSES:
That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
ULYSSES:
When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
ULYSSES:
Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--
ULYSSES:
Why, this hath not a finger's dignity
ULYSSES:
They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war,
ULYSSES:
So that the ram that batters down the wall,
ULYSSES:
For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
ULYSSES:
They place before his hand that made the engine,
ULYSSES:
Or those that with the fineness of their souls
ULYSSES:
By reason guide his execution.
NESTOR:
Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
NESTOR:
Makes many Thetis' sons.
NESTOR:
A tucket
AGAMEMNON:
What trumpet? look, Menelaus.
MENELAUS:
From Troy.
MENELAUS:
Enter AENEAS
AGAMEMNON:
What would you 'fore our tent?
AENEAS:
Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
AGAMEMNON:
Even this.
AENEAS:
May one, that is a herald and a prince,
AENEAS:
Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
AGAMEMNON:
With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
AGAMEMNON:
'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
AGAMEMNON:
Call Agamemnon head and general.
AENEAS:
Fair leave and large security. How may
AENEAS:
A stranger to those most imperial looks
AENEAS:
Know them from eyes of other mortals?
AGAMEMNON:
How!
AENEAS:
Ay,
AENEAS:
I ask, that I might waken reverence,
AENEAS:
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
AENEAS:
Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
AENEAS:
The youthful Phoebus
AENEAS:
Which is that god in office, guiding men?
AENEAS:
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
AGAMEMNON:
This Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy
AGAMEMNON:
Are ceremonious courtiers.
AENEAS:
Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
AENEAS:
As bending angels, that's their fame in peace
AENEAS:
But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
AENEAS:
Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and,
AENEAS:
Jove's accord,
AENEAS:
Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
AENEAS:
Peace, Trojan, lay thy finger on thy lips!
AENEAS:
The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
AENEAS:
If that the praised himself bring the praise forth
AENEAS:
But what the repining enemy commends,
AENEAS:
That breath fame blows, that praise, sole sure,
AENEAS:
transcends.
AGAMEMNON:
Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?
AENEAS:
Ay, Greek, that is my name.
AGAMEMNON:
What's your affair I pray you?
AENEAS:
Sir, pardon, 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
AGAMEMNON:
He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
AENEAS:
Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him
AENEAS:
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
AENEAS:
To set his sense on the attentive bent,
AENEAS:
And then to speak.
AGAMEMNON:
Speak frankly as the wind,
AGAMEMNON:
It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour
AGAMEMNON:
That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
AGAMEMNON:
He tells thee so himself.
AENEAS:
Trumpet, blow loud,
AENEAS:
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents,
AENEAS:
And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
AENEAS:
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
AENEAS:
Trumpet sounds
AENEAS:
We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
AENEAS:
A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
AENEAS:
Who in this dull and long-continued truce
AENEAS:
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
AENEAS:
And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
AENEAS:
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
AENEAS:
That holds his honour higher than his ease,
AENEAS:
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
AENEAS:
That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
AENEAS:
That loves his mistress more than in confession,
AENEAS:
With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
AENEAS:
And dare avow her beauty and her worth
AENEAS:
In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
AENEAS:
Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
AENEAS:
Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
AENEAS:
He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
AENEAS:
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
AENEAS:
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
AENEAS:
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
AENEAS:
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love
AENEAS:
If any come, Hector shall honour him,
AENEAS:
If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
AENEAS:
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
AENEAS:
The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
AGAMEMNON:
This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas,
AGAMEMNON:
If none of them have soul in such a kind,
AGAMEMNON:
We left them all at home: but we are soldiers,
AGAMEMNON:
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
AGAMEMNON:
That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
AGAMEMNON:
If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
AGAMEMNON:
That one meets Hector, if none else, I am he.
NESTOR:
Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
NESTOR:
When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now,
NESTOR:
But if there be not in our Grecian host
NESTOR:
One noble man that hath one spark of fire,
NESTOR:
To answer for his love, tell him from me
NESTOR:
I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
NESTOR:
And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
NESTOR:
And meeting him will tell him that my lady
NESTOR:
Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
NESTOR:
As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
NESTOR:
I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
AENEAS:
Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
ULYSSES:
Amen.
AGAMEMNON:
Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand,
AGAMEMNON:
To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
AGAMEMNON:
Achilles shall have word of this intent,
AGAMEMNON:
So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent
AGAMEMNON:
Yourself shall feast with us before you go
AGAMEMNON:
And find the welcome of a noble foe.
AGAMEMNON:
Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR
ULYSSES:
Nestor!
NESTOR:
What says Ulysses?
ULYSSES:
I have a young conception in my brain,
ULYSSES:
Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
NESTOR:
What is't?
ULYSSES:
This 'tis
ULYSSES:
Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
ULYSSES:
That hath to this maturity blown up
ULYSSES:
In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,
ULYSSES:
Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
ULYSSES:
To overbulk us all.
NESTOR:
Well, and how?
ULYSSES:
This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
ULYSSES:
However it is spread in general name,
ULYSSES:
Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
NESTOR:
The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,
NESTOR:
Whose grossness little characters sum up
NESTOR:
And, in the publication, make no strain,
NESTOR:
But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
NESTOR:
As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,
NESTOR:
'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,
NESTOR:
Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose
NESTOR:
Pointing on him.
ULYSSES:
And wake him to the answer, think you?
NESTOR:
Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
NESTOR:
That can from Hector bring his honour off,
NESTOR:
If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,
NESTOR:
Yet in the trial much opinion dwells,
NESTOR:
For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
NESTOR:
With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
NESTOR:
Our imputation shall be oddly poised
NESTOR:
In this wild action, for the success,
NESTOR:
Although particular, shall give a scantling
NESTOR:
Of good or bad unto the general,
NESTOR:
And in such indexes, although small pricks
NESTOR:
To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
NESTOR:
The baby figure of the giant mass
NESTOR:
Of things to come at large. It is supposed
NESTOR:
He that meets Hector issues from our choice
NESTOR:
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
NESTOR:
Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
NESTOR:
As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd
NESTOR:
Out of our virtues, who miscarrying,
NESTOR:
What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
NESTOR:
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
NESTOR:
Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
NESTOR:
In no less working than are swords and bows
NESTOR:
Directive by the limbs.
ULYSSES:
Give pardon to my speech
ULYSSES:
Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
ULYSSES:
Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,
ULYSSES:
And think, perchance, they'll sell, if not,
ULYSSES:
The lustre of the better yet to show,
ULYSSES:
Shall show the better. Do not consent
ULYSSES:
That ever Hector and Achilles meet,
ULYSSES:
For both our honour and our shame in this
ULYSSES:
Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
NESTOR:
I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
ULYSSES:
What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
ULYSSES:
Were he not proud, we all should share with him
ULYSSES:
But he already is too insolent,
ULYSSES:
A nd we were better parch in Afric sun
ULYSSES:
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
ULYSSES:
Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,
ULYSSES:
Why then, we did our main opinion crush
ULYSSES:
In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery,
ULYSSES:
And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
ULYSSES:
The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
ULYSSES:
Give him allowance for the better man,
ULYSSES:
For that will physic the great Myrmidon
ULYSSES:
Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
ULYSSES:
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
ULYSSES:
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
ULYSSES:
We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
ULYSSES:
Yet go we under our opinion still
ULYSSES:
That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
ULYSSES:
Our project's life this shape of sense assumes
ULYSSES:
Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
NESTOR:
Ulysses,
NESTOR:
Now I begin to relish thy advice,
NESTOR:
And I will give a taste of it forthwith
NESTOR:
To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.
NESTOR:
Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
NESTOR:
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.
NESTOR:
Exeunt
NESTOR:
ACT II
NESTOR:
SCENE I. A part of the Grecian camp.
NESTOR:
Enter AJAX and THERSITES
AJAX:
Thersites!
THERSITES:
Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,
THERSITES:
generally?
AJAX:
Thersites!
THERSITES:
And those boils did run? say so: did not the
THERSITES:
general run then? were not that a botchy core?
AJAX:
Dog!
THERSITES:
Then would come some matter from him, I see none now.
AJAX:
Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
AJAX:
Beating him
AJAX:
Feel, then.
THERSITES:
The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel
THERSITES:
beef-witted lord!
AJAX:
Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will
AJAX:
beat thee into handsomeness.
THERSITES:
I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,
THERSITES:
I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than
THERSITES:
thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
THERSITES:
canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!
AJAX:
Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
THERSITES:
Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?
AJAX:
The proclamation!
THERSITES:
Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.
AJAX:
Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.
THERSITES:
I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had
THERSITES:
the scratching of thee, I would make thee the
THERSITES:
loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in
THERSITES:
the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.
AJAX:
I say, the proclamation!
THERSITES:
Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,
THERSITES:
and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as
THERSITES:
Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou
THERSITES:
barkest at him.
AJAX:
Mistress Thersites!
THERSITES:
Thou shouldest strike him.
AJAX:
Cobloaf!
THERSITES:
He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a
THERSITES:
sailor breaks a biscuit.
AJAX:
[Beating him]  You whoreson cur!
THERSITES:
Do, do.
AJAX:
Thou stool for a witch!
THERSITES:
Ay, do, do, thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no
THERSITES:
more brain than I have in mine elbows, an assinego
THERSITES:
may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art
THERSITES:
here but to thrash Trojans, and thou art bought and
THERSITES:
sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.
THERSITES:
If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and
THERSITES:
tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no
THERSITES:
bowels, thou!
AJAX:
You dog!
THERSITES:
You scurvy lord!
AJAX:
[Beating him]  You cur!
THERSITES:
Mars his idiot! do, rudeness, do, camel, do, do.
THERSITES:
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
ACHILLES:
Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,
ACHILLES:
Thersites! what's the matter, man?
THERSITES:
You see him there, do you?
ACHILLES:
Ay, what's the matter?
THERSITES:
Nay, look upon him.
ACHILLES:
So I do: what's the matter?
THERSITES:
Nay, but regard him well.
ACHILLES:
'Well!' why, I do so.
THERSITES:
But yet you look not well upon him, for whosoever you
THERSITES:
take him to be, he is Ajax.
ACHILLES:
I know that, fool.
THERSITES:
Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
AJAX:
Therefore I beat thee.
THERSITES:
Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his
THERSITES:
evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his
THERSITES:
brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy
THERSITES:
nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not
THERSITES:
worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,
THERSITES:
Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and
THERSITES:
his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of
THERSITES:
him.
ACHILLES:
What?
THERSITES:
I say, this Ajax--
THERSITES:
Ajax offers to beat him
ACHILLES:
Nay, good Ajax.
THERSITES:
Has not so much wit--
ACHILLES:
Nay, I must hold you.
THERSITES:
As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he
THERSITES:
comes to fight.
ACHILLES:
Peace, fool!
THERSITES:
I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will
THERSITES:
not: he there: that he: look you there.
AJAX:
O thou damned cur! I shall--
ACHILLES:
Will you set your wit to a fool's?
THERSITES:
No, I warrant you, for a fools will shame it.
PATROCLUS:
Good words, Thersites.
ACHILLES:
What's the quarrel?
AJAX:
I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
AJAX:
proclamation, and he rails upon me.
THERSITES:
I serve thee not.
AJAX:
Well, go to, go to.
THERSITES:
I serve here voluntarily.
ACHILLES:
Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not
ACHILLES:
voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was
ACHILLES:
here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.
THERSITES:
E'en so, a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your
THERSITES:
sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great
THERSITES:
catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'
THERSITES:
were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
ACHILLES:
What, with me too, Thersites?
THERSITES:
There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy
THERSITES:
ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you
THERSITES:
like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.
ACHILLES:
What, what?
THERSITES:
Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!
AJAX:
I shall cut out your tongue.
THERSITES:
'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou
THERSITES:
afterwards.
PATROCLUS:
No more words, Thersites, peace!
THERSITES:
I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?
ACHILLES:
There's for you, Patroclus.
THERSITES:
I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come
THERSITES:
any more to your tents: I will keep where there is
THERSITES:
wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.
THERSITES:
Exit
PATROCLUS:
A good riddance.
ACHILLES:
Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host
ACHILLES:
That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
ACHILLES:
Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
ACHILLES:
To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
ACHILLES:
That hath a stomach, and such a one that dare
ACHILLES:
Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
AJAX:
Farewell. Who shall answer him?
ACHILLES:
I know not: 'tis put to lottery, otherwise
ACHILLES:
He knew his man.
AJAX:
O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.
AJAX:
Exeunt
AJAX:
SCENE II. Troy. A room in Priam's palace.
AJAX:
Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS
PRIAM:
After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
PRIAM:
Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks
PRIAM:
'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--
PRIAM:
As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
PRIAM:
Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
PRIAM:
In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
PRIAM:
Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?
HECTOR:
Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
HECTOR:
As far as toucheth my particular,
HECTOR:
Yet, dread Priam,
HECTOR:
There is no lady of more softer bowels,
HECTOR:
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
HECTOR:
More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
HECTOR:
Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
HECTOR:
Surety secure, but modest doubt is call'd
HECTOR:
The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
HECTOR:
To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go
HECTOR:
Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
HECTOR:
Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
HECTOR:
Hath been as dear as Helen, I mean, of ours
HECTOR:
If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
HECTOR:
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
HECTOR:
Had it our name, the value of one ten,
HECTOR:
What merit's in that reason which denies
HECTOR:
The yielding of her up?
TROILUS:
Fie, fie, my brother!
TROILUS:
Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
TROILUS:
So great as our dread father in a scale
TROILUS:
Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
TROILUS:
The past proportion of his infinite?
TROILUS:
And buckle in a waist most fathomless
TROILUS:
With spans and inches so diminutive
TROILUS:
As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
HELENUS:
No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,
HELENUS:
You are so empty of them. Should not our father
HELENUS:
Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,
HELENUS:
Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
TROILUS:
You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest,
TROILUS:
You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
TROILUS:
your reasons
TROILUS:
You know an enemy intends you harm,
TROILUS:
You know a sword employ'd is perilous,
TROILUS:
And reason flies the object of all harm
TROILUS:
Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
TROILUS:
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
TROILUS:
The very wings of reason to his heels
TROILUS:
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
TROILUS:
Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
TROILUS:
Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
TROILUS:
Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat
TROILUS:
their thoughts
TROILUS:
With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
TROILUS:
Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
HECTOR:
Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
HECTOR:
The holding.
TROILUS:
What is aught, but as 'tis valued?
HECTOR:
But value dwells not in particular will,
HECTOR:
It holds his estimate and dignity
HECTOR:
As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
HECTOR:
As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
HECTOR:
To make the service greater than the god
HECTOR:
And the will dotes that is attributive
HECTOR:
To what infectiously itself affects,
HECTOR:
Without some image of the affected merit.
TROILUS:
I take to-day a wife, and my election
TROILUS:
Is led on in the conduct of my will,
TROILUS:
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
TROILUS:
Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
TROILUS:
Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
TROILUS:
Although my will distaste what it elected,
TROILUS:
The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
TROILUS:
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour
TROILUS:
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,
TROILUS:
When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands
TROILUS:
We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
TROILUS:
Because we now are full. It was thought meet
TROILUS:
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks
TROILUS:
Your breath of full consent bellied his sails,
TROILUS:
The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
TROILUS:
And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,
TROILUS:
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
TROILUS:
He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
TROILUS:
Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
TROILUS:
Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt
TROILUS:
Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
TROILUS:
Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
TROILUS:
And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
TROILUS:
If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
TROILUS:
As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--
TROILUS:
If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
TROILUS:
As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands
TROILUS:
And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
TROILUS:
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
TROILUS:
And do a deed that fortune never did,
TROILUS:
Beggar the estimation which you prized
TROILUS:
Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
TROILUS:
That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
TROILUS:
But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,
TROILUS:
That in their country did them that disgrace,
TROILUS:
We fear to warrant in our native place!
CASSANDRA:
[Within]  Cry, Trojans, cry!
PRIAM:
What noise? what shriek is this?
TROILUS:
'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.
CASSANDRA:
[Within]  Cry, Trojans!
HECTOR:
It is Cassandra.
HECTOR:
Enter CASSANDRA, raving
CASSANDRA:
Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,
CASSANDRA:
And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
HECTOR:
Peace, sister, peace!
CASSANDRA:
Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
CASSANDRA:
Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
CASSANDRA:
Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
CASSANDRA:
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
CASSANDRA:
Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
CASSANDRA:
Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand,
CASSANDRA:
Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
CASSANDRA:
Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe
CASSANDRA:
Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.
CASSANDRA:
Exit
HECTOR:
Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
HECTOR:
Of divination in our sister work
HECTOR:
Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
HECTOR:
So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
HECTOR:
Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
HECTOR:
Can qualify the same?
TROILUS:
Why, brother Hector,
TROILUS:
We may not think the justness of each act
TROILUS:
Such and no other than event doth form it,
TROILUS:
Nor once deject the courage of our minds,
TROILUS:
Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
TROILUS:
Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
TROILUS:
Which hath our several honours all engaged
TROILUS:
To make it gracious. For my private part,
TROILUS:
I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons
TROILUS:
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
TROILUS:
Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
TROILUS:
To fight for and maintain!
PARIS:
Else might the world convince of levity
PARIS:
As well my undertakings as your counsels
PARIS:
But I attest the gods, your full consent
PARIS:
Gave wings to my propension and cut off
PARIS:
All fears attending on so dire a project.
PARIS:
For what, alas, can these my single arms?
PARIS:
What Propugnation is in one man's valour,
PARIS:
To stand the push and enmity of those
PARIS:
This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
PARIS:
Were I alone to pass the difficulties
PARIS:
And had as ample power as I have will,
PARIS:
Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
PARIS:
Nor faint in the pursuit.
PRIAM:
Paris, you speak
PRIAM:
Like one besotted on your sweet delights
PRIAM:
You have the honey still, but these the gall,
PRIAM:
So to be valiant is no praise at all.
PARIS:
Sir, I propose not merely to myself
PARIS:
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,
PARIS:
But I would have the soil of her fair rape
PARIS:
Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
PARIS:
What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
PARIS:
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,
PARIS:
Now to deliver her possession up
PARIS:
On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
PARIS:
That so degenerate a strain as this
PARIS:
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
PARIS:
There's not the meanest spirit on our party
PARIS:
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
PARIS:
When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
PARIS:
Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
PARIS:
Where Helen is the subject, then, I say,
PARIS:
Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
PARIS:
The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
HECTOR:
Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
HECTOR:
And on the cause and question now in hand
HECTOR:
Have glozed, but superficially: not much
HECTOR:
Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
HECTOR:
Unfit to hear moral philosophy
HECTOR:
The reasons you allege do more conduce
HECTOR:
To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
HECTOR:
Than to make up a free determination
HECTOR:
'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
HECTOR:
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
HECTOR:
Of any true decision. Nature craves
HECTOR:
All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
HECTOR:
What nearer debt in all humanity
HECTOR:
Than wife is to the husband? If this law
HECTOR:
Of nature be corrupted through affection,
HECTOR:
And that great minds, of partial indulgence
HECTOR:
To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
HECTOR:
There is a law in each well-order'd nation
HECTOR:
To curb those raging appetites that are
HECTOR:
Most disobedient and refractory.
HECTOR:
If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
HECTOR:
As it is known she is, these moral laws
HECTOR:
Of nature and of nations speak aloud
HECTOR:
To have her back return'd: thus to persist
HECTOR:
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
HECTOR:
But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
HECTOR:
Is this in way of truth, yet ne'ertheless,
HECTOR:
My spritely brethren, I propend to you
HECTOR:
In resolution to keep Helen still,
HECTOR:
For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
HECTOR:
Upon our joint and several dignities.
TROILUS:
Why, there you touch'd the life of our design
TROILUS:
Were it not glory that we more affected
TROILUS:
Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
TROILUS:
I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
TROILUS:
Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
TROILUS:
She is a theme of honour and renown,
TROILUS:
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
TROILUS:
Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
TROILUS:
And fame in time to come canonize us,
TROILUS:
For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
TROILUS:
So rich advantage of a promised glory
TROILUS:
As smiles upon the forehead of this action
TROILUS:
For the wide world's revenue.
HECTOR:
I am yours,
HECTOR:
You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
HECTOR:
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
HECTOR:
The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
HECTOR:
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
HECTOR:
I was advertised their great general slept,
HECTOR:
Whilst emulation in the army crept
HECTOR:
This, I presume, will wake him.
HECTOR:
Exeunt
HECTOR:
SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
HECTOR:
Enter THERSITES, solus
THERSITES:
How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of
THERSITES:
thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
THERSITES:
beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!
THERSITES:
would it were otherwise, that I could beat him,
THERSITES:
whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to
THERSITES:
conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of
THERSITES:
my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a
THERSITES:
rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
THERSITES:
undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of
THERSITES:
themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
THERSITES:
forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,
THERSITES:
Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy
THERSITES:
caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less
THERSITES:
than little wit from them that they have! which
THERSITES:
short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
THERSITES:
scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
THERSITES:
from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and
THERSITES:
cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the
THERSITES:
whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,
THERSITES:
methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war
THERSITES:
for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
THERSITES:
say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!
THERSITES:
Enter PATROCLUS
PATROCLUS:
Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.
THERSITES:
If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou
THERSITES:
wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
THERSITES:
it is no matter, thyself upon thyself! The common
THERSITES:
curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in
THERSITES:
great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and
THERSITES:
discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
THERSITES:
direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
THERSITES:
out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and
THERSITES:
sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.
THERSITES:
Amen. Where's Achilles?
PATROCLUS:
What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?
THERSITES:
Ay: the heavens hear me!
THERSITES:
Enter ACHILLES
ACHILLES:
Who's there?
PATROCLUS:
Thersites, my lord.
ACHILLES:
Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my
ACHILLES:
digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to
ACHILLES:
my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?
THERSITES:
Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,
THERSITES:
what's Achilles?
PATROCLUS:
Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,
PATROCLUS:
what's thyself?
THERSITES:
Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,
THERSITES:
what art thou?
PATROCLUS:
Thou mayst tell that knowest.
ACHILLES:
O, tell, tell.
THERSITES:
I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
THERSITES:
Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am Patroclus'
THERSITES:
knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
PATROCLUS:
You rascal!
THERSITES:
Peace, fool! I have not done.
ACHILLES:
He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.
THERSITES:
Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool, Thersites
THERSITES:
is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
ACHILLES:
Derive this, come.
THERSITES:
Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles,
THERSITES:
Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon,
THERSITES:
Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and
THERSITES:
Patroclus is a fool positive.
PATROCLUS:
Why am I a fool?
THERSITES:
Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou
THERSITES:
art. Look you, who comes here?
ACHILLES:
Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.
ACHILLES:
Come in with me, Thersites.
ACHILLES:
Exit
THERSITES:
Here is such patchery, such juggling and such
THERSITES:
knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a
THERSITES:
whore, a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
THERSITES:
and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on
THERSITES:
the subject! and war and lechery confound all!
THERSITES:
Exit
THERSITES:
Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and AJAX
AGAMEMNON:
Where is Achilles?
PATROCLUS:
Within his tent, but ill disposed, my lord.
AGAMEMNON:
Let it be known to him that we are here.
AGAMEMNON:
He shent our messengers, and we lay by
AGAMEMNON:
Our appertainments, visiting of him
AGAMEMNON:
Let him be told so, lest perchance he think
AGAMEMNON:
We dare not move the question of our place,
AGAMEMNON:
Or know not what we are.
PATROCLUS:
I shall say so to him.
PATROCLUS:
Exit
ULYSSES:
We saw him at the opening of his tent
ULYSSES:
He is not sick.
AJAX:
Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it
AJAX:
melancholy, if you will favour the man, but, by my
AJAX:
head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the
AJAX:
cause. A word, my lord.
AJAX:
Takes AGAMEMNON aside
NESTOR:
What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
ULYSSES:
Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
NESTOR:
Who, Thersites?
ULYSSES:
He.
NESTOR:
Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.
ULYSSES:
No, you see, he is his argument that has his
ULYSSES:
argument, Achilles.
NESTOR:
All the better, their fraction is more our wish than
NESTOR:
their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
NESTOR:
could disunite.
ULYSSES:
The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily
ULYSSES:
untie. Here comes Patroclus.
ULYSSES:
Re-enter PATROCLUS
NESTOR:
No Achilles with him.
ULYSSES:
The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy
ULYSSES:
his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
PATROCLUS:
Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,
PATROCLUS:
If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
PATROCLUS:
Did move your greatness and this noble state
PATROCLUS:
To call upon him, he hopes it is no other
PATROCLUS:
But for your health and your digestion sake,
PATROCLUS:
And after-dinner's breath.
AGAMEMNON:
Hear you, Patroclus
AGAMEMNON:
We are too well acquainted with these answers
AGAMEMNON:
But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
AGAMEMNON:
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
AGAMEMNON:
Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
AGAMEMNON:
Why we ascribe it to him, yet all his virtues,
AGAMEMNON:
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
AGAMEMNON:
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
AGAMEMNON:
Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
AGAMEMNON:
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
AGAMEMNON:
We come to speak with him, and you shall not sin,
AGAMEMNON:
If you do say we think him over-proud
AGAMEMNON:
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
AGAMEMNON:
Than in the note of judgment, and worthier
AGAMEMNON:
than himself
AGAMEMNON:
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
AGAMEMNON:
Disguise the holy strength of their command,
AGAMEMNON:
And underwrite in an observing kind
AGAMEMNON:
His humorous predominance, yea, watch
AGAMEMNON:
His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
AGAMEMNON:
The passage and whole carriage of this action
AGAMEMNON:
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
AGAMEMNON:
That if he overhold his price so much,
AGAMEMNON:
We'll none of him, but let him, like an engine
AGAMEMNON:
Not portable, lie under this report
AGAMEMNON:
'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war
AGAMEMNON:
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
AGAMEMNON:
Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
PATROCLUS:
I shall, and bring his answer presently.
PATROCLUS:
Exit
AGAMEMNON:
In second voice we'll not be satisfied,
AGAMEMNON:
We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
AGAMEMNON:
Exit ULYSSES
AJAX:
What is he more than another?
AGAMEMNON:
No more than what he thinks he is.
AJAX:
Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
AJAX:
better man than I am?
AGAMEMNON:
No question.
AJAX:
Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
AGAMEMNON:
No, noble Ajax, you are as strong, as valiant, as
AGAMEMNON:
wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether
AGAMEMNON:
more tractable.
AJAX:
Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
AJAX:
know not what pride is.
AGAMEMNON:
Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
AGAMEMNON:
fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
AGAMEMNON:
his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle,
AGAMEMNON:
and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours
AGAMEMNON:
the deed in the praise.
AJAX:
I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.
NESTOR:
Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
NESTOR:
Aside
NESTOR:
Re-enter ULYSSES
ULYSSES:
Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
AGAMEMNON:
What's his excuse?
ULYSSES:
He doth rely on none,
ULYSSES:
But carries on the stream of his dispose
ULYSSES:
Without observance or respect of any,
ULYSSES:
In will peculiar and in self-admission.
AGAMEMNON:
Why will he not upon our fair request
AGAMEMNON:
Untent his person and share the air with us?
ULYSSES:
Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,
ULYSSES:
He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,
ULYSSES:
And speaks not to himself but with a pride
ULYSSES:
That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
ULYSSES:
Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
ULYSSES:
That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
ULYSSES:
Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
ULYSSES:
And batters down himself: what should I say?
ULYSSES:
He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
ULYSSES:
Cry 'No recovery.'
AGAMEMNON:
Let Ajax go to him.
AGAMEMNON:
Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent
AGAMEMNON:
'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
AGAMEMNON:
At your request a little from himself.
ULYSSES:
O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
ULYSSES:
We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
ULYSSES:
When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
ULYSSES:
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
ULYSSES:
And never suffers matter of the world
ULYSSES:
Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
ULYSSES:
And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd
ULYSSES:
Of that we hold an idol more than he?
ULYSSES:
No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
ULYSSES:
Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,
ULYSSES:
Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
ULYSSES:
As amply titled as Achilles is,
ULYSSES:
By going to Achilles
ULYSSES:
That were to enlard his fat already pride
ULYSSES:
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
ULYSSES:
With entertaining great Hyperion.
ULYSSES:
This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
ULYSSES:
And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
NESTOR:
[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O, this is well, he rubs the
NESTOR:
vein of him.
DIOMEDES:
[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks up
DIOMEDES:
this applause!
AJAX:
If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.
AGAMEMNON:
O, no, you shall not go.
AJAX:
An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride
AJAX:
Let me go to him.
ULYSSES:
Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
AJAX:
A paltry, insolent fellow!
NESTOR:
How he describes himself!
AJAX:
Can he not be sociable?
ULYSSES:
The raven chides blackness.
AJAX:
I'll let his humours blood.
AGAMEMNON:
He will be the physician that should be the patient.
AJAX:
An all men were o' my mind,--
ULYSSES:
Wit would be out of fashion.
AJAX:
A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first
AJAX:
shall pride carry it?
NESTOR:
An 'twould, you'ld carry half.
ULYSSES:
A' would have ten shares.
AJAX:
I will knead him, I'll make him supple.
NESTOR:
He's not yet through warm: force him with praises
NESTOR:
pour in, pour in, his ambition is dry.
ULYSSES:
[To AGAMEMNON]  My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
NESTOR:
Our noble general, do not do so.
DIOMEDES:
You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
ULYSSES:
Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
ULYSSES:
Here is a man--but 'tis before his face,
ULYSSES:
I will be silent.
NESTOR:
Wherefore should you so?
NESTOR:
He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
ULYSSES:
Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
AJAX:
A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!
AJAX:
Would he were a Trojan!
NESTOR:
What a vice were it in Ajax now,--
ULYSSES:
If he were proud,--
DIOMEDES:
Or covetous of praise,--
ULYSSES:
Ay, or surly borne,--
DIOMEDES:
Or strange, or self-affected!
ULYSSES:
Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure,
ULYSSES:
Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck
ULYSSES:
Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
ULYSSES:
Thrice famed, beyond all erudition
ULYSSES:
But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,
ULYSSES:
Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
ULYSSES:
And give him half: and, for thy vigour,
ULYSSES:
Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
ULYSSES:
To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
ULYSSES:
Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines
ULYSSES:
Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor,
ULYSSES:
Instructed by the antiquary times,
ULYSSES:
He must, he is, he cannot but be wise
ULYSSES:
Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
ULYSSES:
As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,
ULYSSES:
You should not have the eminence of him,
ULYSSES:
But be as Ajax.
AJAX:
Shall I call you father?
NESTOR:
Ay, my good son.
DIOMEDES:
Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.
ULYSSES:
There is no tarrying here, the hart Achilles
ULYSSES:
Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
ULYSSES:
To call together all his state of war,
ULYSSES:
Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow
ULYSSES:
We must with all our main of power stand fast
ULYSSES:
And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,
ULYSSES:
And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
AGAMEMNON:
Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep
AGAMEMNON:
Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
AGAMEMNON:
Exeunt
AGAMEMNON:
ACT III
AGAMEMNON:
SCENE I. Troy. Priam's palace.
AGAMEMNON:
Enter a Servant and PANDARUS
PANDARUS:
Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow
PANDARUS:
the young Lord Paris?
Servant:
Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
PANDARUS:
You depend upon him, I mean?
Servant:
Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
PANDARUS:
You depend upon a noble gentleman, I must needs
PANDARUS:
praise him.
Servant:
The lord be praised!
PANDARUS:
You know me, do you not?
Servant:
Faith, sir, superficially.
PANDARUS:
Friend, know me better, I am the Lord Pandarus.
Servant:
I hope I shall know your honour better.
PANDARUS:
I do desire it.
Servant:
You are in the state of grace.
PANDARUS:
Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.
PANDARUS:
Music within
PANDARUS:
What music is this?
Servant:
I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.
PANDARUS:
Know you the musicians?
Servant:
Wholly, sir.
PANDARUS:
Who play they to?
Servant:
To the hearers, sir.
PANDARUS:
At whose pleasure, friend
Servant:
At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
PANDARUS:
Command, I mean, friend.
Servant:
Who shall I command, sir?
PANDARUS:
Friend, we understand not one another: I am too
PANDARUS:
courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request
PANDARUS:
do these men play?
Servant:
That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request
Servant:
of Paris my lord, who's there in person, with him,
Servant:
the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's
Servant:
invisible soul,--
PANDARUS:
Who, my cousin Cressida?
Servant:
No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her
Servant:
attributes?
PANDARUS:
It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the
PANDARUS:
Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the
PANDARUS:
Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault
PANDARUS:
upon him, for my business seethes.
Servant:
Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
Servant:
Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended
PANDARUS:
Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair
PANDARUS:
company! fair desires, in all fair measure,
PANDARUS:
fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!
PANDARUS:
fair thoughts be your fair pillow!
HELEN:
Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
PANDARUS:
You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair
PANDARUS:
prince, here is good broken music.
PARIS:
You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you
PARIS:
shall make it whole again, you shall piece it out
PARIS:
with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full
PARIS:
of harmony.
PANDARUS:
Truly, lady, no.
HELEN:
O, sir,--
PANDARUS:
Rude, in sooth, in good sooth, very rude.
PARIS:
Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.
PANDARUS:
I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,
PANDARUS:
will you vouchsafe me a word?
HELEN:
Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you
HELEN:
sing, certainly.
PANDARUS:
Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,
PANDARUS:
marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed
PANDARUS:
friend, your brother Troilus,--
HELEN:
My Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord,--
PANDARUS:
Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most
PANDARUS:
affectionately to you,--
HELEN:
You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,
HELEN:
our melancholy upon your head!
PANDARUS:
Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.
HELEN:
And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
PANDARUS:
Nay, that shall not serve your turn, that shall not,
PANDARUS:
in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words, no,
PANDARUS:
no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king
PANDARUS:
call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.
HELEN:
My Lord Pandarus,--
PANDARUS:
What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
PARIS:
What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?
HELEN:
Nay, but, my lord,--
PANDARUS:
What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out
PANDARUS:
with you. You must not know where he sups.
PARIS:
I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
PANDARUS:
No, no, no such matter, you are wide: come, your
PANDARUS:
disposer is sick.
PARIS:
Well, I'll make excuse.
PANDARUS:
Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,
PANDARUS:
your poor disposer's sick.
PARIS:
I spy.
PANDARUS:
You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
PANDARUS:
instrument. Now, sweet queen.
HELEN:
Why, this is kindly done.
PANDARUS:
My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,
PANDARUS:
sweet queen.
HELEN:
She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.
PANDARUS:
He! no, she'll none of him, they two are twain.
HELEN:
Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
PANDARUS:
Come, come, I'll hear no more of this, I'll sing
PANDARUS:
you a song now.
HELEN:
Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou
HELEN:
hast a fine forehead.
PANDARUS:
Ay, you may, you may.
HELEN:
Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.
HELEN:
O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!
PANDARUS:
Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.
PARIS:
Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
PANDARUS:
In good troth, it begins so.
PANDARUS:
Sings
PANDARUS:
Love, love, nothing but love, still more!
PANDARUS:
For, O, love's bow
PANDARUS:
Shoots buck and doe
PANDARUS:
The shaft confounds,
PANDARUS:
Not that it wounds,
PANDARUS:
But tickles still the sore.
PANDARUS:
These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!
PANDARUS:
Yet that which seems the wound to kill,
PANDARUS:
Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!
PANDARUS:
So dying love lives still
PANDARUS:
Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
PANDARUS:
Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!
PANDARUS:
Heigh-ho!
HELEN:
In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
PARIS:
He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot
PARIS:
blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot
PARIS:
thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.
PANDARUS:
Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot
PANDARUS:
thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers
PANDARUS:
is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's
PANDARUS:
a-field to-day?
PARIS:
Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the
PARIS:
gallantry of Troy: I  would fain have armed to-day,
PARIS:
but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my
PARIS:
brother Troilus went not?
HELEN:
He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.
PANDARUS:
Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they
PANDARUS:
sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
PARIS:
To a hair.
PANDARUS:
Farewell, sweet queen.
HELEN:
Commend me to your niece.
PANDARUS:
I will, sweet queen.
PANDARUS:
Exit
PANDARUS:
A retreat sounded
PARIS:
They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,
PARIS:
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
PARIS:
To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
PARIS:
With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
PARIS:
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
PARIS:
Or force of Greekish sinews, you shall do more
PARIS:
Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.
HELEN:
'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris,
HELEN:
Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
HELEN:
Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
HELEN:
Yea, overshines ourself.
PARIS:
Sweet, above thought I love thee.
PARIS:
Exeunt
PARIS:
SCENE II. The same. Pandarus' orchard.
PARIS:
Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting
PANDARUS:
How now! where's thy master? at my cousin
PANDARUS:
Cressida's?
Boy:
No, sir, he stays for you to conduct him thither.
PANDARUS:
O, here he comes.
PANDARUS:
Enter TROILUS
PANDARUS:
How now, how now!
TROILUS:
Sirrah, walk off.
TROILUS:
Exit Boy
PANDARUS:
Have you seen my cousin?
TROILUS:
No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,
TROILUS:
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
TROILUS:
Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,
TROILUS:
And give me swift transportance to those fields
TROILUS:
Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
TROILUS:
Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,
TROILUS:
From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
TROILUS:
And fly with me to Cressid!
PANDARUS:
Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.
PANDARUS:
Exit
TROILUS:
I am giddy, expectation whirls me round.
TROILUS:
The imaginary relish is so sweet
TROILUS:
That it enchants my sense: what will it be,
TROILUS:
When that the watery palate tastes indeed
TROILUS:
Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,
TROILUS:
Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
TROILUS:
Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,
TROILUS:
For the capacity of my ruder powers
TROILUS:
I fear it much, and I do fear besides,
TROILUS:
That I shall lose distinction in my joys,
TROILUS:
As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
TROILUS:
The enemy flying.
TROILUS:
Re-enter PANDARUS
PANDARUS:
She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you
PANDARUS:
must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches
PANDARUS:
her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a
PANDARUS:
sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest
PANDARUS:
villain: she fetches her breath as short as a
PANDARUS:
new-ta'en sparrow.
PANDARUS:
Exit
TROILUS:
Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom
TROILUS:
My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,
TROILUS:
And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
TROILUS:
Like vassalage at unawares encountering
TROILUS:
The eye of majesty.
TROILUS:
Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA
PANDARUS:
Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.
PANDARUS:
Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that
PANDARUS:
you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?
PANDARUS:
you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?
PANDARUS:
Come your ways, come your ways, an you draw backward,
PANDARUS:
we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to
PANDARUS:
her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your
PANDARUS:
picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend
PANDARUS:
daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.
PANDARUS:
So, so, rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!
PANDARUS:
a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter, the air
PANDARUS:
is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
PANDARUS:
I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the
PANDARUS:
ducks i' the river: go to, go to.
TROILUS:
You have bereft me of all words, lady.
PANDARUS:
Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll
PANDARUS:
bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your
PANDARUS:
activity in question. What, billing again? Here's
PANDARUS:
'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--
PANDARUS:
Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.
PANDARUS:
Exit
CRESSIDA:
Will you walk in, my lord?
TROILUS:
O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!
CRESSIDA:
Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!
TROILUS:
What should they grant? what makes this pretty
TROILUS:
abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet
TROILUS:
lady in the fountain of our love?
CRESSIDA:
More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
TROILUS:
Fears make devils of cherubims, they never see truly.
CRESSIDA:
Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer
CRESSIDA:
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
CRESSIDA:
fear the worst oft cures the worse.
TROILUS:
O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's
TROILUS:
pageant there is presented no monster.
CRESSIDA:
Nor nothing monstrous neither?
TROILUS:
Nothing, but our undertakings, when we vow to weep
TROILUS:
seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers, thinking
TROILUS:
it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
TROILUS:
enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
TROILUS:
This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will
TROILUS:
is infinite and the execution confined, that the
TROILUS:
desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.
CRESSIDA:
They say all lovers swear more performance than they
CRESSIDA:
are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
CRESSIDA:
perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and
CRESSIDA:
discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
CRESSIDA:
that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,
CRESSIDA:
are they not monsters?
TROILUS:
Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
TROILUS:
are tasted, allow us as we prove, our head shall go
TROILUS:
bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
TROILUS:
shall have a praise in present: we will not name
TROILUS:
desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition
TROILUS:
shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
TROILUS:
shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
TROILUS:
shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can
TROILUS:
speak truest not truer than Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
Will you walk in, my lord?
CRESSIDA:
Re-enter PANDARUS
PANDARUS:
What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?
CRESSIDA:
Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.
PANDARUS:
I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,
PANDARUS:
you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
PANDARUS:
flinch, chide me for it.
TROILUS:
You know now your hostages, your uncle's word and my
TROILUS:
firm faith.
PANDARUS:
Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,
PANDARUS:
though they be long ere they are wooed, they are
PANDARUS:
constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you,
PANDARUS:
they'll stick where they are thrown.
CRESSIDA:
Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.
CRESSIDA:
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
CRESSIDA:
For many weary months.
TROILUS:
Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
CRESSIDA:
Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,
CRESSIDA:
With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
CRESSIDA:
If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
CRESSIDA:
I love you now, but not, till now, so much
CRESSIDA:
But I might master it: in faith, I lie,
CRESSIDA:
My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
CRESSIDA:
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
CRESSIDA:
Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
CRESSIDA:
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
CRESSIDA:
But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not,
CRESSIDA:
And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
CRESSIDA:
Or that we women had men's privilege
CRESSIDA:
Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
CRESSIDA:
For in this rapture I shall surely speak
CRESSIDA:
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
CRESSIDA:
Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
CRESSIDA:
My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.
TROILUS:
And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.
PANDARUS:
Pretty, i' faith.
CRESSIDA:
My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me,
CRESSIDA:
'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss
CRESSIDA:
I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
CRESSIDA:
For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
TROILUS:
Your leave, sweet Cressid!
PANDARUS:
Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--
CRESSIDA:
Pray you, content you.
TROILUS:
What offends you, lady?
CRESSIDA:
Sir, mine own company.
TROILUS:
You cannot shun Yourself.
CRESSIDA:
Let me go and try
CRESSIDA:
I have a kind of self resides with you,
CRESSIDA:
But an unkind self, that itself will leave,
CRESSIDA:
To be another's fool. I would be gone
CRESSIDA:
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
TROILUS:
Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
CRESSIDA:
Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love,
CRESSIDA:
And fell so roundly to a large confession,
CRESSIDA:
To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,
CRESSIDA:
Or else you love not, for to be wise and love
CRESSIDA:
Exceeds man's might, that dwells with gods above.
TROILUS:
O that I thought it could be in a woman--
TROILUS:
As, if it can, I will presume in you--
TROILUS:
To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love,
TROILUS:
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
TROILUS:
Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
TROILUS:
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
TROILUS:
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,
TROILUS:
That my integrity and truth to you
TROILUS:
Might be affronted with the match and weight
TROILUS:
Of such a winnow'd purity in love,
TROILUS:
How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
TROILUS:
I am as true as truth's simplicity
TROILUS:
And simpler than the infancy of truth.
CRESSIDA:
In that I'll war with you.
TROILUS:
O virtuous fight,
TROILUS:
When right with right wars who shall be most right!
TROILUS:
True swains in love shall in the world to come
TROILUS:
Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,
TROILUS:
Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
TROILUS:
Want similes, truth tired with iteration,
TROILUS:
As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
TROILUS:
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
TROILUS:
As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,
TROILUS:
Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
TROILUS:
As truth's authentic author to be cited,
TROILUS:
'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,
TROILUS:
And sanctify the numbers.
CRESSIDA:
Prophet may you be!
CRESSIDA:
If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
CRESSIDA:
When time is old and hath forgot itself,
CRESSIDA:
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
CRESSIDA:
And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
CRESSIDA:
And mighty states characterless are grated
CRESSIDA:
To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
CRESSIDA:
From false to false, among false maids in love,
CRESSIDA:
Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
CRESSIDA:
As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
CRESSIDA:
As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,
CRESSIDA:
Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'
CRESSIDA:
'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
CRESSIDA:
'As false as Cressid.'
PANDARUS:
Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it, I'll be the
PANDARUS:
witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.
PANDARUS:
If ever you prove false one to another, since I have
PANDARUS:
taken such pains to bring you together, let all
PANDARUS:
pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end
PANDARUS:
after my name, call them all Pandars, let all
PANDARUS:
constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,
PANDARUS:
and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.
TROILUS:
Amen.
CRESSIDA:
Amen.
PANDARUS:
Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
PANDARUS:
bed, which bed, because it shall not speak of your
PANDARUS:
pretty encounters, press it to death: away!
PANDARUS:
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
PANDARUS:
Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!
PANDARUS:
Exeunt
PANDARUS:
SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
PANDARUS:
Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHAS
CALCHAS:
Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
CALCHAS:
The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
CALCHAS:
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
CALCHAS:
That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
CALCHAS:
I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
CALCHAS:
Incurr'd a traitor's name, exposed myself,
CALCHAS:
From certain and possess'd conveniences,
CALCHAS:
To doubtful fortunes, sequestering from me all
CALCHAS:
That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
CALCHAS:
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
CALCHAS:
And here, to do you service, am become
CALCHAS:
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted
CALCHAS:
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
CALCHAS:
To give me now a little benefit,
CALCHAS:
Out of those many register'd in promise,
CALCHAS:
Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
AGAMEMNON:
What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.
CALCHAS:
You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
CALCHAS:
Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
CALCHAS:
Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
CALCHAS:
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
CALCHAS:
Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
CALCHAS:
I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
CALCHAS:
That their negotiations all must slack,
CALCHAS:
Wanting his manage, and they will almost
CALCHAS:
Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
CALCHAS:
In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
CALCHAS:
And he shall buy my daughter, and her presence
CALCHAS:
Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
CALCHAS:
In most accepted pain.
AGAMEMNON:
Let Diomedes bear him,
AGAMEMNON:
And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
AGAMEMNON:
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
AGAMEMNON:
Furnish you fairly for this interchange
AGAMEMNON:
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
AGAMEMNON:
Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
DIOMEDES:
This shall I undertake, and 'tis a burden
DIOMEDES:
Which I am proud to bear.
DIOMEDES:
Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS
DIOMEDES:
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent
ULYSSES:
Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent
ULYSSES:
Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
ULYSSES:
As if he were forgot, and, princes all,
ULYSSES:
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him
ULYSSES:
I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
ULYSSES:
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him
ULYSSES:
If so, I have derision medicinable,
ULYSSES:
To use between your strangeness and his pride,
ULYSSES:
Which his own will shall have desire to drink
ULYSSES:
It may be good: pride hath no other glass
ULYSSES:
To show itself but pride, for supple knees
ULYSSES:
Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
AGAMEMNON:
We'll execute your purpose, and put on
AGAMEMNON:
A form of strangeness as we pass along
AGAMEMNON:
So do each lord, and either greet him not,
AGAMEMNON:
Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
AGAMEMNON:
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
ACHILLES:
What, comes the general to speak with me?
ACHILLES:
You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
AGAMEMNON:
What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
NESTOR:
Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
ACHILLES:
No.
NESTOR:
Nothing, my lord.
AGAMEMNON:
The better.
AGAMEMNON:
Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR
ACHILLES:
Good day, good day.
MENELAUS:
How do you? how do you?
MENELAUS:
Exit
ACHILLES:
What, does the cuckold scorn me?
AJAX:
How now, Patroclus!
ACHILLES:
Good morrow, Ajax.
AJAX:
Ha?
ACHILLES:
Good morrow.
AJAX:
Ay, and good next day too.
AJAX:
Exit
ACHILLES:
What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
PATROCLUS:
They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
PATROCLUS:
To send their smiles before them to Achilles,
PATROCLUS:
To come as humbly as they used to creep
PATROCLUS:
To holy altars.
ACHILLES:
What, am I poor of late?
ACHILLES:
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
ACHILLES:
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
ACHILLES:
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
ACHILLES:
As feel in his own fall, for men, like butterflies,
ACHILLES:
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
ACHILLES:
And not a man, for being simply man,
ACHILLES:
Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
ACHILLES:
That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
ACHILLES:
Prizes of accident as oft as merit
ACHILLES:
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
ACHILLES:
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
ACHILLES:
Do one pluck down another and together
ACHILLES:
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me
ACHILLES:
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
ACHILLES:
At ample point all that I did possess,
ACHILLES:
Save these men's looks, who do, methinks, find out
ACHILLES:
Something not worth in me such rich beholding
ACHILLES:
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses,
ACHILLES:
I'll interrupt his reading.
ACHILLES:
How now Ulysses!
ULYSSES:
Now, great Thetis' son!
ACHILLES:
What are you reading?
ULYSSES:
A strange fellow here
ULYSSES:
Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
ULYSSES:
How much in having, or without or in,
ULYSSES:
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
ULYSSES:
Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection,
ULYSSES:
As when his virtues shining upon others
ULYSSES:
Heat them and they retort that heat again
ULYSSES:
To the first giver.'
ACHILLES:
This is not strange, Ulysses.
ACHILLES:
The beauty that is borne here in the face
ACHILLES:
The bearer knows not, but commends itself
ACHILLES:
To others' eyes, nor doth the eye itself,
ACHILLES:
That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
ACHILLES:
Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed
ACHILLES:
Salutes each other with each other's form,
ACHILLES:
For speculation turns not to itself,
ACHILLES:
Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
ACHILLES:
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
ULYSSES:
I do not strain at the position,--
ULYSSES:
It is familiar,--but at the author's drift,
ULYSSES:
Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
ULYSSES:
That no man is the lord of any thing,
ULYSSES:
Though in and of him there be much consisting,
ULYSSES:
Till he communicate his parts to others
ULYSSES:
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
ULYSSES:
Till he behold them form'd in the applause
ULYSSES:
Where they're extended, who, like an arch,
ULYSSES:
reverberates
ULYSSES:
The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
ULYSSES:
Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
ULYSSES:
His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this,
ULYSSES:
And apprehended here immediately
ULYSSES:
The unknown Ajax.
ULYSSES:
Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
ULYSSES:
That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
ULYSSES:
Most abject in regard and dear in use!
ULYSSES:
What things again most dear in the esteem
ULYSSES:
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
ULYSSES:
An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
ULYSSES:
Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
ULYSSES:
While some men leave to do!
ULYSSES:
How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
ULYSSES:
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
ULYSSES:
How one man eats into another's pride,
ULYSSES:
While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
ULYSSES:
To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
ULYSSES:
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
ULYSSES:
As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
ULYSSES:
And great Troy shrieking.
ACHILLES:
I do believe it, for they pass'd by me
ACHILLES:
As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
ACHILLES:
Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
ULYSSES:
Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
ULYSSES:
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
ULYSSES:
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes
ULYSSES:
Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour'd
ULYSSES:
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
ULYSSES:
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
ULYSSES:
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
ULYSSES:
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
ULYSSES:
In monumental mockery. Take the instant way,
ULYSSES:
For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
ULYSSES:
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path,
ULYSSES:
For emulation hath a thousand sons
ULYSSES:
That one by one pursue: if you give way,
ULYSSES:
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
ULYSSES:
Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
ULYSSES:
And leave you hindmost,
ULYSSES:
Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
ULYSSES:
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
ULYSSES:
O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
ULYSSES:
Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours,
ULYSSES:
For time is like a fashionable host
ULYSSES:
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
ULYSSES:
And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
ULYSSES:
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
ULYSSES:
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
ULYSSES:
virtue seek
ULYSSES:
Remuneration for the thing it was,
ULYSSES:
For beauty, wit,
ULYSSES:
High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
ULYSSES:
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
ULYSSES:
To envious and calumniating time.
ULYSSES:
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
ULYSSES:
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
ULYSSES:
Though they are made and moulded of things past,
ULYSSES:
And give to dust that is a little gilt
ULYSSES:
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
ULYSSES:
The present eye praises the present object.
ULYSSES:
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
ULYSSES:
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,
ULYSSES:
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
ULYSSES:
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
ULYSSES:
And still it might, and yet it may again,
ULYSSES:
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
ULYSSES:
And case thy reputation in thy tent,
ULYSSES:
Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
ULYSSES:
Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
ULYSSES:
And drave great Mars to faction.
ACHILLES:
Of this my privacy
ACHILLES:
I have strong reasons.
ULYSSES:
But 'gainst your privacy
ULYSSES:
The reasons are more potent and heroical
ULYSSES:
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
ULYSSES:
With one of Priam's daughters.
ACHILLES:
Ha! known!
ULYSSES:
Is that a wonder?
ULYSSES:
The providence that's in a watchful state
ULYSSES:
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
ULYSSES:
Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
ULYSSES:
Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
ULYSSES:
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
ULYSSES:
There is a mystery--with whom relation
ULYSSES:
Durst never meddle--in the soul of state,
ULYSSES:
Which hath an operation more divine
ULYSSES:
Than breath or pen can give expressure to
ULYSSES:
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
ULYSSES:
As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord,
ULYSSES:
And better would it fit Achilles much
ULYSSES:
To throw down Hector than Polyxena
ULYSSES:
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
ULYSSES:
When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
ULYSSES:
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
ULYSSES:
'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
ULYSSES:
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
ULYSSES:
Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak,
ULYSSES:
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
ULYSSES:
Exit
PATROCLUS:
To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you
PATROCLUS:
A woman impudent and mannish grown
PATROCLUS:
Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
PATROCLUS:
In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this,
PATROCLUS:
They think my little stomach to the war
PATROCLUS:
And your great love to me restrains you thus
PATROCLUS:
Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid
PATROCLUS:
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
PATROCLUS:
And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
PATROCLUS:
Be shook to air.
ACHILLES:
Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
PATROCLUS:
Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
ACHILLES:
I see my reputation is at stake
ACHILLES:
My fame is shrewdly gored.
PATROCLUS:
O, then, beware,
PATROCLUS:
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
PATROCLUS:
Omission to do what is necessary
PATROCLUS:
Seals a commission to a blank of danger,
PATROCLUS:
And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
PATROCLUS:
Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
ACHILLES:
Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus
ACHILLES:
I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
ACHILLES:
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
ACHILLES:
To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
ACHILLES:
An appetite that I am sick withal,
ACHILLES:
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
ACHILLES:
To talk with him and to behold his visage,
ACHILLES:
Even to my full of view.
ACHILLES:
Enter THERSITES
ACHILLES:
A labour saved!
THERSITES:
A wonder!
ACHILLES:
What?
THERSITES:
Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.
ACHILLES:
How so?
THERSITES:
He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
THERSITES:
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
THERSITES:
raves in saying nothing.
ACHILLES:
How can that be?
THERSITES:
Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
THERSITES:
and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
THERSITES:
arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning
THERSITES:
bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
THERSITES:
say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out,'
THERSITES:
and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
THERSITES:
in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
THERSITES:
The man's undone forever, for if Hector break not his
THERSITES:
neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in
THERSITES:
vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,
THERSITES:
Ajax,' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think
THERSITES:
you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
THERSITES:
grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
THERSITES:
A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
THERSITES:
sides, like a leather jerkin.
ACHILLES:
Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
THERSITES:
Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody, he professes not
THERSITES:
answering: speaking is for beggars, he wears his
THERSITES:
tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
THERSITES:
Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the
THERSITES:
pageant of Ajax.
ACHILLES:
To him, Patroclus, tell him I humbly desire the
ACHILLES:
valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
ACHILLES:
to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
ACHILLES:
safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
ACHILLES:
and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
ACHILLES:
captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
ACHILLES:
et cetera. Do this.
PATROCLUS:
Jove bless great Ajax!
THERSITES:
Hum!
PATROCLUS:
I come from the worthy Achilles,--
THERSITES:
Ha!
PATROCLUS:
Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--
THERSITES:
Hum!
PATROCLUS:
And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
THERSITES:
Agamemnon!
PATROCLUS:
Ay, my lord.
THERSITES:
Ha!
PATROCLUS:
What say you to't?
THERSITES:
God b' wi' you, with all my heart.
PATROCLUS:
Your answer, sir.
THERSITES:
If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will
THERSITES:
go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me
THERSITES:
ere he has me.
PATROCLUS:
Your answer, sir.
THERSITES:
Fare you well, with all my heart.
ACHILLES:
Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
THERSITES:
No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in
THERSITES:
him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know
THERSITES:
not, but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo
THERSITES:
get his sinews to make catlings on.
ACHILLES:
Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
THERSITES:
Let me bear another to his horse, for that's the more
THERSITES:
capable creature.
ACHILLES:
My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd,
ACHILLES:
And I myself see not the bottom of it.
ACHILLES:
Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
THERSITES:
Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,
THERSITES:
that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
THERSITES:
tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.
THERSITES:
Exit
THERSITES:
ACT IV
THERSITES:
SCENE I. Troy. A street.
THERSITES:
Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a  torch, from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, DIOMEDES, and others, with torches
PARIS:
See, ho! who is that there?
DEIPHOBUS:
It is the Lord AEneas.
AENEAS:
Is the prince there in person?
AENEAS:
Had I so good occasion to lie long
AENEAS:
As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
AENEAS:
Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
DIOMEDES:
That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.
PARIS:
A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--
PARIS:
Witness the process of your speech, wherein
PARIS:
You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
PARIS:
Did haunt you in the field.
AENEAS:
Health to you, valiant sir,
AENEAS:
During all question of the gentle truce,
AENEAS:
But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
AENEAS:
As heart can think or courage execute.
DIOMEDES:
The one and other Diomed embraces.
DIOMEDES:
Our bloods are now in calm, and, so long, health!
DIOMEDES:
But when contention and occasion meet,
DIOMEDES:
By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
DIOMEDES:
With all my force, pursuit and policy.
AENEAS:
And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
AENEAS:
With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
AENEAS:
Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
AENEAS:
Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
AENEAS:
No man alive can love in such a sort
AENEAS:
The thing he means to kill more excellently.
DIOMEDES:
We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,
DIOMEDES:
If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
DIOMEDES:
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
DIOMEDES:
But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,
DIOMEDES:
With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
AENEAS:
We know each other well.
DIOMEDES:
We do, and long to know each other worse.
PARIS:
This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
PARIS:
The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
PARIS:
What business, lord, so early?
AENEAS:
I was sent for to the king, but why, I know not.
PARIS:
His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
PARIS:
To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
PARIS:
For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid
PARIS:
Let's have your company, or, if you please,
PARIS:
Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
PARIS:
Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--
PARIS:
My brother Troilus lodges there to-night
PARIS:
Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
PARIS:
With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
PARIS:
We shall be much unwelcome.
AENEAS:
That I assure you
AENEAS:
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
AENEAS:
Than Cressid borne from Troy.
PARIS:
There is no help,
PARIS:
The bitter disposition of the time
PARIS:
Will have it so. On, lord, we'll follow you.
AENEAS:
Good morrow, all.
AENEAS:
Exit with Servant
PARIS:
And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,
PARIS:
Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
PARIS:
Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,
PARIS:
Myself or Menelaus?
DIOMEDES:
Both alike
DIOMEDES:
He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,
DIOMEDES:
Not making any scruple of her soilure,
DIOMEDES:
With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
DIOMEDES:
And you as well to keep her, that defend her,
DIOMEDES:
Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
DIOMEDES:
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends
DIOMEDES:
He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
DIOMEDES:
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece,
DIOMEDES:
You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
DIOMEDES:
Are pleased to breed out your inheritors
DIOMEDES:
Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more,
DIOMEDES:
But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
PARIS:
You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
DIOMEDES:
She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris
DIOMEDES:
For every false drop in her bawdy veins
DIOMEDES:
A Grecian's life hath sunk, for every scruple
DIOMEDES:
Of her contaminated carrion weight,
DIOMEDES:
A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,
DIOMEDES:
She hath not given so many good words breath
DIOMEDES:
As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
PARIS:
Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
PARIS:
Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy
PARIS:
But we in silence hold this virtue well,
PARIS:
We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
PARIS:
Here lies our way.
PARIS:
Exeunt
PARIS:
SCENE II. The same. Court of Pandarus' house.
PARIS:
Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA
TROILUS:
Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
CRESSIDA:
Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down,
CRESSIDA:
He shall unbolt the gates.
TROILUS:
Trouble him not,
TROILUS:
To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,
TROILUS:
And give as soft attachment to thy senses
TROILUS:
As infants' empty of all thought!
CRESSIDA:
Good morrow, then.
TROILUS:
I prithee now, to bed.
CRESSIDA:
Are you a-weary of me?
TROILUS:
O Cressida! but that the busy day,
TROILUS:
Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
TROILUS:
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
TROILUS:
I would not from thee.
CRESSIDA:
Night hath been too brief.
TROILUS:
Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
TROILUS:
As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
TROILUS:
With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
TROILUS:
You will catch cold, and curse me.
CRESSIDA:
Prithee, tarry
CRESSIDA:
You men will never tarry.
CRESSIDA:
O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
CRESSIDA:
And then you would have tarried. Hark!
CRESSIDA:
there's one up.
PANDARUS:
[Within]  What, 's all the doors open here?
TROILUS:
It is your uncle.
CRESSIDA:
A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking
CRESSIDA:
I shall have such a life!
CRESSIDA:
Enter PANDARUS
PANDARUS:
How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you
PANDARUS:
maid! where's my cousin Cressid?
CRESSIDA:
Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
CRESSIDA:
You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
PANDARUS:
To do what? to do what? let her say
PANDARUS:
what: what have I brought you to do?
CRESSIDA:
Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
CRESSIDA:
Nor suffer others.
PANDARUS:
Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!
PANDARUS:
hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty
PANDARUS:
man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!
CRESSIDA:
Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
CRESSIDA:
Knocking within
CRESSIDA:
Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.
CRESSIDA:
My lord, come you again into my chamber
CRESSIDA:
You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
TROILUS:
Ha, ha!
CRESSIDA:
Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
CRESSIDA:
Knocking within
CRESSIDA:
How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in
CRESSIDA:
I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
CRESSIDA:
Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA
PANDARUS:
Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
PANDARUS:
down the door? How now! what's the matter?
PANDARUS:
Enter AENEAS
AENEAS:
Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
PANDARUS:
Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
PANDARUS:
I knew you not: what news with you so early?
AENEAS:
Is not Prince Troilus here?
PANDARUS:
Here! what should he do here?
AENEAS:
Come, he is here, my lord, do not deny him
AENEAS:
It doth import him much to speak with me.
PANDARUS:
Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll
PANDARUS:
be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What
PANDARUS:
should he do here?
AENEAS:
Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong
AENEAS:
ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be
AENEAS:
false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go
AENEAS:
fetch him hither, go.
AENEAS:
Re-enter TROILUS
TROILUS:
How now! what's the matter?
AENEAS:
My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
AENEAS:
My matter is so rash: there is at hand
AENEAS:
Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
AENEAS:
The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
AENEAS:
Deliver'd to us, and for him forthwith,
AENEAS:
Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
AENEAS:
We must give up to Diomedes' hand
AENEAS:
The Lady Cressida.
TROILUS:
Is it so concluded?
AENEAS:
By Priam and the general state of Troy
AENEAS:
They are at hand and ready to effect it.
TROILUS:
How my achievements mock me!
TROILUS:
I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,
TROILUS:
We met by chance, you did not find me here.
AENEAS:
Good, good, my lord, the secrets of nature
AENEAS:
Have not more gift in taciturnity.
AENEAS:
Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS
PANDARUS:
Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil
PANDARUS:
take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a
PANDARUS:
plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!
PANDARUS:
Re-enter CRESSIDA
CRESSIDA:
How now! what's the matter? who was here?
PANDARUS:
Ah, ah!
CRESSIDA:
Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
CRESSIDA:
Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
PANDARUS:
Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
CRESSIDA:
O the gods! what's the matter?
PANDARUS:
Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
PANDARUS:
born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor
PANDARUS:
gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
CRESSIDA:
Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,
CRESSIDA:
what's the matter?
PANDARUS:
Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone, thou
PANDARUS:
art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,
PANDARUS:
and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death,
PANDARUS:
'twill be his bane, he cannot bear it.
CRESSIDA:
O you immortal gods! I will not go.
PANDARUS:
Thou must.
CRESSIDA:
I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father,
CRESSIDA:
I know no touch of consanguinity,
CRESSIDA:
No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me
CRESSIDA:
As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
CRESSIDA:
Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
CRESSIDA:
If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
CRESSIDA:
Do to this body what extremes you can,
CRESSIDA:
But the strong base and building of my love
CRESSIDA:
Is as the very centre of the earth,
CRESSIDA:
Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--
PANDARUS:
Do, do.
CRESSIDA:
Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,
CRESSIDA:
Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
CRESSIDA:
With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.
CRESSIDA:
Exeunt
CRESSIDA:
SCENE III. The same. Street before Pandarus' house.
CRESSIDA:
Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, and DIOMEDES
PARIS:
It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
PARIS:
Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
PARIS:
Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
PARIS:
Tell you the lady what she is to do,
PARIS:
And haste her to the purpose.
TROILUS:
Walk into her house,
TROILUS:
I'll bring her to the Grecian presently
TROILUS:
And to his hand when I deliver her,
TROILUS:
Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
TROILUS:
A priest there offering to it his own heart.
TROILUS:
Exit
PARIS:
I know what 'tis to love,
PARIS:
And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
PARIS:
Please you walk in, my lords.
PARIS:
Exeunt
PARIS:
SCENE IV. The same. Pandarus' house.
PARIS:
Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA
PANDARUS:
Be moderate, be moderate.
CRESSIDA:
Why tell you me of moderation?
CRESSIDA:
The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
CRESSIDA:
And violenteth in a sense as strong
CRESSIDA:
As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
CRESSIDA:
If I could temporize with my affection,
CRESSIDA:
Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
CRESSIDA:
The like allayment could I give my grief.
CRESSIDA:
My love admits no qualifying dross,
CRESSIDA:
No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
PANDARUS:
Here, here, here he comes.
PANDARUS:
Enter TROILUS
PANDARUS:
Ah, sweet ducks!
CRESSIDA:
O Troilus! Troilus!
CRESSIDA:
Embracing him
PANDARUS:
What a pair of spectacles is here!
PANDARUS:
Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,
PANDARUS:
'--O heart, heavy heart,
PANDARUS:
Why sigh'st thou without breaking?
PANDARUS:
where he answers again,
PANDARUS:
'Because thou canst not ease thy smart
PANDARUS:
By friendship nor by speaking.'
PANDARUS:
There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
PANDARUS:
nothing, for we may live to have need of such a
PANDARUS:
verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?
TROILUS:
Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,
TROILUS:
That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,
TROILUS:
More bright in zeal than the devotion which
TROILUS:
Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.
CRESSIDA:
Have the gods envy?
PANDARUS:
Ay, ay, ay, ay, 'tis too plain a case.
CRESSIDA:
And is it true that I must go from Troy?
TROILUS:
A hateful truth.
CRESSIDA:
What, and from Troilus too?
TROILUS:
From Troy and Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
Is it possible?
TROILUS:
And suddenly, where injury of chance
TROILUS:
Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
TROILUS:
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
TROILUS:
Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
TROILUS:
Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
TROILUS:
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath
TROILUS:
We two, that with so many thousand sighs
TROILUS:
Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
TROILUS:
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
TROILUS:
Injurious time now with a robber's haste
TROILUS:
Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how
TROILUS:
As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
TROILUS:
With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
TROILUS:
He fumbles up into a lose adieu,
TROILUS:
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
TROILUS:
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
AENEAS:
[Within]  My lord, is the lady ready?
TROILUS:
Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
TROILUS:
Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
TROILUS:
Bid them have patience, she shall come anon.
PANDARUS:
Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or
PANDARUS:
my heart will be blown up by the root.
PANDARUS:
Exit
CRESSIDA:
I must then to the Grecians?
TROILUS:
No remedy.
CRESSIDA:
A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
CRESSIDA:
When shall we see again?
TROILUS:
Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--
CRESSIDA:
I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?
TROILUS:
Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
TROILUS:
For it is parting from us
TROILUS:
I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,
TROILUS:
For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
TROILUS:
That there's no maculation in thy heart
TROILUS:
But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in
TROILUS:
My sequent protestation, be thou true,
TROILUS:
And I will see thee.
CRESSIDA:
O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers
CRESSIDA:
As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.
TROILUS:
And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
CRESSIDA:
And you this glove. When shall I see you?
TROILUS:
I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,
TROILUS:
To give thee nightly visitation.
TROILUS:
But yet be true.
CRESSIDA:
O heavens! 'be true' again!
TROILUS:
Hear while I speak it, love
TROILUS:
The Grecian youths are full of quality,
TROILUS:
They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,
TROILUS:
Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise
TROILUS:
How novelty may move, and parts with person,
TROILUS:
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--
TROILUS:
Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--
TROILUS:
Makes me afeard.
CRESSIDA:
O heavens! you love me not.
TROILUS:
Die I a villain, then!
TROILUS:
In this I do not call your faith in question
TROILUS:
So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,
TROILUS:
Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
TROILUS:
Nor play at subtle games, fair virtues all,
TROILUS:
To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant
TROILUS:
But I can tell that in each grace of these
TROILUS:
There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
TROILUS:
That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
CRESSIDA:
Do you think I will?
TROILUS:
No.
TROILUS:
But something may be done that we will not
TROILUS:
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
TROILUS:
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
TROILUS:
Presuming on their changeful potency.
AENEAS:
[Within]  Nay, good my lord,--
TROILUS:
Come, kiss, and let us part.
PARIS:
[Within]  Brother Troilus!
TROILUS:
Good brother, come you hither,
TROILUS:
And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.
CRESSIDA:
My lord, will you be true?
TROILUS:
Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault
TROILUS:
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
TROILUS:
I with great truth catch mere simplicity,
TROILUS:
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
TROILUS:
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
TROILUS:
Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
TROILUS:
Is 'plain and true,' there's all the reach of it.
TROILUS:
Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS, and DIOMEDES
TROILUS:
Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady
TROILUS:
Which for Antenor we deliver you
TROILUS:
At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,
TROILUS:
And by the way possess thee what she is.
TROILUS:
Entreat her fair, and, by my soul, fair Greek,
TROILUS:
If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
TROILUS:
Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
TROILUS:
As Priam is in Ilion.
DIOMEDES:
Fair Lady Cressid,
DIOMEDES:
So please you, save the thanks this prince expects
DIOMEDES:
The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
DIOMEDES:
Pleads your fair usage, and to Diomed
DIOMEDES:
You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.
TROILUS:
Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,
TROILUS:
To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
TROILUS:
In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,
TROILUS:
She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
TROILUS:
As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
TROILUS:
I charge thee use her well, even for my charge,
TROILUS:
For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
TROILUS:
Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
TROILUS:
I'll cut thy throat.
DIOMEDES:
O, be not moved, Prince Troilus
DIOMEDES:
Let me be privileged by my place and message,
DIOMEDES:
To be a speaker free, when I am hence
DIOMEDES:
I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,
DIOMEDES:
I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
DIOMEDES:
She shall be prized, but that you say 'be't so,'
DIOMEDES:
I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'
TROILUS:
Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,
TROILUS:
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
TROILUS:
Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
TROILUS:
To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
TROILUS:
Exeunt TROILUS, CRESSIDA, and DIOMEDES
TROILUS:
Trumpet within
PARIS:
Hark! Hector's trumpet.
AENEAS:
How have we spent this morning!
AENEAS:
The prince must think me tardy and remiss,
AENEAS:
That sore to ride before him to the field.
PARIS:
'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.
DEIPHOBUS:
Let us make ready straight.
AENEAS:
Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,
AENEAS:
Let us address to tend on Hector's heels
AENEAS:
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
AENEAS:
On his fair worth and single chivalry.
AENEAS:
Exeunt
AENEAS:
SCENE V. The Grecian camp. Lists set out.
AENEAS:
Enter AJAX, armed, AGAMEMNON, ACHILLES, PATROCLUS, MENELAUS, ULYSSES, NESTOR, and others
AGAMEMNON:
Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
AGAMEMNON:
Anticipating time with starting courage.
AGAMEMNON:
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
AGAMEMNON:
Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appalled air
AGAMEMNON:
May pierce the head of the great combatant
AGAMEMNON:
And hale him hither.
AJAX:
Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
AJAX:
Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe
AJAX:
Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
AJAX:
Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon
AJAX:
Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood,
AJAX:
Thou blow'st for Hector.
AJAX:
Trumpet sounds
ULYSSES:
No trumpet answers.
ACHILLES:
'Tis but early days.
AGAMEMNON:
Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
ULYSSES:
'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait,
ULYSSES:
He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
ULYSSES:
In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
ULYSSES:
Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA
AGAMEMNON:
Is this the Lady Cressid?
DIOMEDES:
Even she.
AGAMEMNON:
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
NESTOR:
Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
ULYSSES:
Yet is the kindness but particular,
ULYSSES:
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
NESTOR:
And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
NESTOR:
So much for Nestor.
ACHILLES:
I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady
ACHILLES:
Achilles bids you welcome.
MENELAUS:
I had good argument for kissing once.
PATROCLUS:
But that's no argument for kissing now,
PATROCLUS:
For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
PATROCLUS:
And parted thus you and your argument.
ULYSSES:
O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
ULYSSES:
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
PATROCLUS:
The first was Menelaus' kiss, this, mine
PATROCLUS:
Patroclus kisses you.
MENELAUS:
O, this is trim!
PATROCLUS:
Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
MENELAUS:
I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.
CRESSIDA:
In kissing, do you render or receive?
PATROCLUS:
Both take and give.
CRESSIDA:
I'll make my match to live,
CRESSIDA:
The kiss you take is better than you give,
CRESSIDA:
Therefore no kiss.
MENELAUS:
I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.
CRESSIDA:
You're an odd man, give even or give none.
MENELAUS:
An odd man, lady! every man is odd.
CRESSIDA:
No, Paris is not, for you know 'tis true,
CRESSIDA:
That you are odd, and he is even with you.
MENELAUS:
You fillip me o' the head.
CRESSIDA:
No, I'll be sworn.
ULYSSES:
It were no match, your nail against his horn.
ULYSSES:
May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
CRESSIDA:
You may.
ULYSSES:
I do desire it.
CRESSIDA:
Why, beg, then.
ULYSSES:
Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,
ULYSSES:
When Helen is a maid again, and his.
CRESSIDA:
I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.
ULYSSES:
Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
DIOMEDES:
Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.
DIOMEDES:
Exit with CRESSIDA
NESTOR:
A woman of quick sense.
ULYSSES:
Fie, fie upon her!
ULYSSES:
There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
ULYSSES:
Nay, her foot speaks, her wanton spirits look out
ULYSSES:
At every joint and motive of her body.
ULYSSES:
O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
ULYSSES:
That give accosting welcome ere it comes,
ULYSSES:
And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
ULYSSES:
To every ticklish reader! set them down
ULYSSES:
For sluttish spoils of opportunity
ULYSSES:
And daughters of the game.
ULYSSES:
Trumpet within
ALL:
The Trojans' trumpet.
AGAMEMNON:
Yonder comes the troop.
AGAMEMNON:
Enter HECTOR, armed, AENEAS, TROILUS, and other Trojans, with Attendants
AENEAS:
Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
AENEAS:
To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
AENEAS:
A victor shall be known? will you the knights
AENEAS:
Shall to the edge of all extremity
AENEAS:
Pursue each other, or shall be divided
AENEAS:
By any voice or order of the field?
AENEAS:
Hector bade ask.
AGAMEMNON:
Which way would Hector have it?
AENEAS:
He cares not, he'll obey conditions.
ACHILLES:
'Tis done like Hector, but securely done,
ACHILLES:
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
ACHILLES:
The knight opposed.
AENEAS:
If not Achilles, sir,
AENEAS:
What is your name?
ACHILLES:
If not Achilles, nothing.
AENEAS:
Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this
AENEAS:
In the extremity of great and little,
AENEAS:
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector,
AENEAS:
The one almost as infinite as all,
AENEAS:
The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
AENEAS:
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
AENEAS:
This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood
AENEAS:
In love whereof, half Hector stays at home,
AENEAS:
Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
AENEAS:
This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
ACHILLES:
A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.
ACHILLES:
Re-enter DIOMEDES
AGAMEMNON:
Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
AGAMEMNON:
Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
AGAMEMNON:
Consent upon the order of their fight,
AGAMEMNON:
So be it, either to the uttermost,
AGAMEMNON:
Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
AGAMEMNON:
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
AGAMEMNON:
AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists
ULYSSES:
They are opposed already.
AGAMEMNON:
What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
ULYSSES:
The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
ULYSSES:
Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
ULYSSES:
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue,
ULYSSES:
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd
ULYSSES:
His heart and hand both open and both free,
ULYSSES:
For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,
ULYSSES:
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
ULYSSES:
Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath,
ULYSSES:
Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,
ULYSSES:
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
ULYSSES:
To tender objects, but he in heat of action
ULYSSES:
Is more vindicative than jealous love
ULYSSES:
They call him Troilus, and on him erect
ULYSSES:
A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
ULYSSES:
Thus says AEneas, one that knows the youth
ULYSSES:
Even to his inches, and with private soul
ULYSSES:
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
ULYSSES:
Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight
AGAMEMNON:
They are in action.
NESTOR:
Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
TROILUS:
Hector, thou sleep'st,
TROILUS:
Awake thee!
AGAMEMNON:
His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!
DIOMEDES:
You must no more.
DIOMEDES:
Trumpets cease
AENEAS:
Princes, enough, so please you.
AJAX:
I am not warm yet, let us fight again.
DIOMEDES:
As Hector pleases.
HECTOR:
Why, then will I no more
HECTOR:
Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
HECTOR:
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed,
HECTOR:
The obligation of our blood forbids
HECTOR:
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain
HECTOR:
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
HECTOR:
That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,
HECTOR:
And this is Trojan, the sinews of this leg
HECTOR:
All Greek, and this all Troy, my mother's blood
HECTOR:
Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
HECTOR:
Bounds in my father's,' by Jove multipotent,
HECTOR:
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
HECTOR:
Wherein my sword had not impressure made
HECTOR:
Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
HECTOR:
That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
HECTOR:
My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
HECTOR:
Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax
HECTOR:
By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms,
HECTOR:
Hector would have them fall upon him thus
HECTOR:
Cousin, all honour to thee!
AJAX:
I thank thee, Hector
AJAX:
Thou art too gentle and too free a man
AJAX:
I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
AJAX:
A great addition earned in thy death.
HECTOR:
Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
HECTOR:
On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
HECTOR:
Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
HECTOR:
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
AENEAS:
There is expectance here from both the sides,
AENEAS:
What further you will do.
HECTOR:
We'll answer it,
HECTOR:
The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.
AJAX:
If I might in entreaties find success--
AJAX:
As seld I have the chance--I would desire
AJAX:
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
DIOMEDES:
'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
DIOMEDES:
Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
HECTOR:
AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
HECTOR:
And signify this loving interview
HECTOR:
To the expecters of our Trojan part,
HECTOR:
Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin,
HECTOR:
I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
AJAX:
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
HECTOR:
The worthiest of them tell me name by name,
HECTOR:
But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
HECTOR:
Shall find him by his large and portly size.
AGAMEMNON:
Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
AGAMEMNON:
That would be rid of such an enemy,
AGAMEMNON:
But that's no welcome: understand more clear,
AGAMEMNON:
What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
AGAMEMNON:
And formless ruin of oblivion,
AGAMEMNON:
But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
AGAMEMNON:
Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
AGAMEMNON:
Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
AGAMEMNON:
From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.
HECTOR:
I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
AGAMEMNON:
[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy, no
AGAMEMNON:
less to you.
MENELAUS:
Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting
MENELAUS:
You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
HECTOR:
Who must we answer?
AENEAS:
The noble Menelaus.
HECTOR:
O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
HECTOR:
Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath,
HECTOR:
Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove
HECTOR:
She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
MENELAUS:
Name her not now, sir, she's a deadly theme.
HECTOR:
O, pardon, I offend.
NESTOR:
I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
NESTOR:
Labouring for destiny make cruel way
NESTOR:
Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
NESTOR:
As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
NESTOR:
Despising many forfeits and subduements,
NESTOR:
When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
NESTOR:
Not letting it decline on the declined,
NESTOR:
That I have said to some my standers by
NESTOR:
'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
NESTOR:
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
NESTOR:
When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
NESTOR:
Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen,
NESTOR:
But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
NESTOR:
I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
NESTOR:
And once fought with him: he was a soldier good,
NESTOR:
But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
NESTOR:
Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee,
NESTOR:
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
AENEAS:
'Tis the old Nestor.
HECTOR:
Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
HECTOR:
That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time
HECTOR:
Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
NESTOR:
I would my arms could match thee in contention,
NESTOR:
As they contend with thee in courtesy.
HECTOR:
I would they could.
NESTOR:
Ha!
NESTOR:
By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.
NESTOR:
Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.
ULYSSES:
I wonder now how yonder city stands
ULYSSES:
When we have here her base and pillar by us.
HECTOR:
I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
HECTOR:
Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
HECTOR:
Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
HECTOR:
In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.
ULYSSES:
Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue
ULYSSES:
My prophecy is but half his journey yet,
ULYSSES:
For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
ULYSSES:
Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
ULYSSES:
Must kiss their own feet.
HECTOR:
I must not believe you
HECTOR:
There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
HECTOR:
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
HECTOR:
A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
HECTOR:
And that old common arbitrator, Time,
HECTOR:
Will one day end it.
ULYSSES:
So to him we leave it.
ULYSSES:
Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome
ULYSSES:
After the general, I beseech you next
ULYSSES:
To feast with me and see me at my tent.
ACHILLES:
I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
ACHILLES:
Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee,
ACHILLES:
I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
ACHILLES:
And quoted joint by joint.
HECTOR:
Is this Achilles?
ACHILLES:
I am Achilles.
HECTOR:
Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.
ACHILLES:
Behold thy fill.
HECTOR:
Nay, I have done already.
ACHILLES:
Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
ACHILLES:
As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.
HECTOR:
O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er,
HECTOR:
But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
HECTOR:
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
ACHILLES:
Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
ACHILLES:
Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
ACHILLES:
That I may give the local wound a name
ACHILLES:
And make distinct the very breach whereout
ACHILLES:
Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!
HECTOR:
It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
HECTOR:
To answer such a question: stand again
HECTOR:
Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
HECTOR:
As to prenominate in nice conjecture
HECTOR:
Where thou wilt hit me dead?
ACHILLES:
I tell thee, yea.
HECTOR:
Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
HECTOR:
I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well,
HECTOR:
For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there,
HECTOR:
But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
HECTOR:
I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
HECTOR:
You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag,
HECTOR:
His insolence draws folly from my lips,
HECTOR:
But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
HECTOR:
Or may I never--
AJAX:
Do not chafe thee, cousin
AJAX:
And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
AJAX:
Till accident or purpose bring you to't
AJAX:
You may have every day enough of Hector
AJAX:
If you have stomach, the general state, I fear,
AJAX:
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
HECTOR:
I pray you, let us see you in the field
HECTOR:
We have had pelting wars, since you refused
HECTOR:
The Grecians' cause.
ACHILLES:
Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
ACHILLES:
To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death,
ACHILLES:
To-night all friends.
HECTOR:
Thy hand upon that match.
AGAMEMNON:
First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent,
AGAMEMNON:
There in the full convive we: afterwards,
AGAMEMNON:
As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
AGAMEMNON:
Concur together, severally entreat him.
AGAMEMNON:
Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
AGAMEMNON:
That this great soldier may his welcome know.
AGAMEMNON:
Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES
TROILUS:
My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
TROILUS:
In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?
ULYSSES:
At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus
ULYSSES:
There Diomed doth feast with him to-night,
ULYSSES:
Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
ULYSSES:
But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
ULYSSES:
On the fair Cressid.
TROILUS:
Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
TROILUS:
After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
TROILUS:
To bring me thither?
ULYSSES:
You shall command me, sir.
ULYSSES:
As gentle tell me, of what honour was
ULYSSES:
This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
ULYSSES:
That wails her absence?
TROILUS:
O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars
TROILUS:
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
TROILUS:
She was beloved, she loved, she is, and doth
TROILUS:
But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.
TROILUS:
Exeunt
TROILUS:
ACT V
TROILUS:
SCENE I. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
TROILUS:
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
ACHILLES:
I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,
ACHILLES:
Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.
ACHILLES:
Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.
PATROCLUS:
Here comes Thersites.
PATROCLUS:
Enter THERSITES
ACHILLES:
How now, thou core of envy!
ACHILLES:
Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?
THERSITES:
Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol
THERSITES:
of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.
ACHILLES:
From whence, fragment?
THERSITES:
Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.
PATROCLUS:
Who keeps the tent now?
THERSITES:
The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.
PATROCLUS:
Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?
THERSITES:
Prithee, be silent, boy, I profit not by thy talk
THERSITES:
thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.
PATROCLUS:
Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?
THERSITES:
Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases
THERSITES:
of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,
THERSITES:
loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold
THERSITES:
palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing
THERSITES:
lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,
THERSITES:
limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the
THERSITES:
rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take
THERSITES:
again such preposterous discoveries!
PATROCLUS:
Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest
PATROCLUS:
thou to curse thus?
THERSITES:
Do I curse thee?
PATROCLUS:
Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson
PATROCLUS:
indistinguishable cur, no.
THERSITES:
No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle
THERSITES:
immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet
THERSITES:
flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's
THERSITES:
purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered
THERSITES:
with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!
PATROCLUS:
Out, gall!
THERSITES:
Finch-egg!
ACHILLES:
My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
ACHILLES:
From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
ACHILLES:
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
ACHILLES:
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
ACHILLES:
Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
ACHILLES:
An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it
ACHILLES:
Fall Greeks, fail fame, honour or go or stay,
ACHILLES:
My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
ACHILLES:
Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent
ACHILLES:
This night in banqueting must all be spent.
ACHILLES:
Away, Patroclus!
ACHILLES:
Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
THERSITES:
With too much blood and too little brain, these two
THERSITES:
may run mad, but, if with too much brain and too
THERSITES:
little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.
THERSITES:
Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one
THERSITES:
that loves quails, but he has not so much brain as
THERSITES:
earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter
THERSITES:
there, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,
THERSITES:
and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a thrifty
THERSITES:
shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's
THERSITES:
leg,--to what form but that he is, should wit larded
THERSITES:
with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
THERSITES:
To an ass, were nothing, he is both ass and ox: to
THERSITES:
an ox, were nothing, he is both ox and ass. To be a
THERSITES:
dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an
THERSITES:
owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would
THERSITES:
not care, but to be Menelaus, I would conspire
THERSITES:
against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I
THERSITES:
were not Thersites, for I care not to be the louse
THERSITES:
of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!
THERSITES:
spirits and fires!
THERSITES:
Enter HECTOR, TROILUS, AJAX, AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, MENELAUS, and DIOMEDES, with lights
AGAMEMNON:
We go wrong, we go wrong.
AJAX:
No, yonder 'tis,
AJAX:
There, where we see the lights.
HECTOR:
I trouble you.
AJAX:
No, not a whit.
ULYSSES:
Here comes himself to guide you.
ULYSSES:
Re-enter ACHILLES
ACHILLES:
Welcome, brave Hector, welcome, princes all.
AGAMEMNON:
So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.
AGAMEMNON:
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
HECTOR:
Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.
MENELAUS:
Good night, my lord.
HECTOR:
Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.
THERSITES:
Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,
THERSITES:
sweet sewer.
ACHILLES:
Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
ACHILLES:
That go or tarry.
AGAMEMNON:
Good night.
AGAMEMNON:
Exeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS
ACHILLES:
Old Nestor tarries, and you too, Diomed,
ACHILLES:
Keep Hector company an hour or two.
DIOMEDES:
I cannot, lord, I have important business,
DIOMEDES:
The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.
HECTOR:
Give me your hand.
ULYSSES:
[Aside to TROILUS]  Follow his torch, he goes to
ULYSSES:
Calchas' tent
ULYSSES:
I'll keep you company.
TROILUS:
Sweet sir, you honour me.
HECTOR:
And so, good night.
HECTOR:
Exit DIOMEDES, ULYSSES and TROILUS following
ACHILLES:
Come, come, enter my tent.
ACHILLES:
Exeunt ACHILLES, HECTOR, AJAX, and NESTOR
THERSITES:
That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most
THERSITES:
unjust knave, I will no more trust him when he leers
THERSITES:
than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
THERSITES:
his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound
THERSITES:
but when he performs, astronomers foretell it, it
THERSITES:
is prodigious, there will come some change, the sun
THERSITES:
borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
THERSITES:
word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than
THERSITES:
not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
THERSITES:
drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll
THERSITES:
after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!
THERSITES:
Exit
THERSITES:
SCENE II. The same. Before Calchas' tent.
THERSITES:
Enter DIOMEDES
DIOMEDES:
What, are you up here, ho? speak.
CALCHAS:
[Within]  Who calls?
DIOMEDES:
Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?
CALCHAS:
[Within]  She comes to you.
CALCHAS:
Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES, at a distance, after them, THERSITES
ULYSSES:
Stand where the torch may not discover us.
ULYSSES:
Enter CRESSIDA
TROILUS:
Cressid comes forth to him.
DIOMEDES:
How now, my charge!
CRESSIDA:
Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.
CRESSIDA:
Whispers
TROILUS:
Yea, so familiar!
ULYSSES:
She will sing any man at first sight.
THERSITES:
And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff,
THERSITES:
she's noted.
DIOMEDES:
Will you remember?
CRESSIDA:
Remember! yes.
DIOMEDES:
Nay, but do, then,
DIOMEDES:
And let your mind be coupled with your words.
TROILUS:
What should she remember?
ULYSSES:
List.
CRESSIDA:
Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
THERSITES:
Roguery!
DIOMEDES:
Nay, then,--
CRESSIDA:
I'll tell you what,--
DIOMEDES:
Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.
CRESSIDA:
In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?
THERSITES:
A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.
DIOMEDES:
What did you swear you would bestow on me?
CRESSIDA:
I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath,
CRESSIDA:
Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.
DIOMEDES:
Good night.
TROILUS:
Hold, patience!
ULYSSES:
How now, Trojan!
CRESSIDA:
Diomed,--
DIOMEDES:
No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.
TROILUS:
Thy better must.
CRESSIDA:
Hark, one word in your ear.
TROILUS:
O plague and madness!
ULYSSES:
You are moved, prince, let us depart, I pray you,
ULYSSES:
Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
ULYSSES:
To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous,
ULYSSES:
The time right deadly, I beseech you, go.
TROILUS:
Behold, I pray you!
ULYSSES:
Nay, good my lord, go off
ULYSSES:
You flow to great distraction, come, my lord.
TROILUS:
I pray thee, stay.
ULYSSES:
You have not patience, come.
TROILUS:
I pray you, stay, by hell and all hell's torments
TROILUS:
I will not speak a word!
DIOMEDES:
And so, good night.
CRESSIDA:
Nay, but you part in anger.
TROILUS:
Doth that grieve thee?
TROILUS:
O wither'd truth!
ULYSSES:
Why, how now, lord!
TROILUS:
By Jove,
TROILUS:
I will be patient.
CRESSIDA:
Guardian!--why, Greek!
DIOMEDES:
Foh, foh! adieu, you palter.
CRESSIDA:
In faith, I do not: come hither once again.
ULYSSES:
You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?
ULYSSES:
You will break out.
TROILUS:
She strokes his cheek!
ULYSSES:
Come, come.
TROILUS:
Nay, stay, by Jove, I will not speak a word
TROILUS:
There is between my will and all offences
TROILUS:
A guard of patience: stay a little while.
THERSITES:
How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and
THERSITES:
potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!
DIOMEDES:
But will you, then?
CRESSIDA:
In faith, I will, la, never trust me else.
DIOMEDES:
Give me some token for the surety of it.
CRESSIDA:
I'll fetch you one.
CRESSIDA:
Exit
ULYSSES:
You have sworn patience.
TROILUS:
Fear me not, sweet lord,
TROILUS:
I will not be myself, nor have cognition
TROILUS:
Of what I feel: I am all patience.
TROILUS:
Re-enter CRESSIDA
THERSITES:
Now the pledge, now, now, now!
CRESSIDA:
Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.
TROILUS:
O beauty! where is thy faith?
ULYSSES:
My lord,--
TROILUS:
I will be patient, outwardly I will.
CRESSIDA:
You look upon that sleeve, behold it well.
CRESSIDA:
He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.
DIOMEDES:
Whose was't?
CRESSIDA:
It is no matter, now I have't again.
CRESSIDA:
I will not meet with you to-morrow night
CRESSIDA:
I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.
THERSITES:
Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!
DIOMEDES:
I shall have it.
CRESSIDA:
What, this?
DIOMEDES:
Ay, that.
CRESSIDA:
O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
CRESSIDA:
Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
CRESSIDA:
Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
CRESSIDA:
And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
CRESSIDA:
As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me,
CRESSIDA:
He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
DIOMEDES:
I had your heart before, this follows it.
TROILUS:
I did swear patience.
CRESSIDA:
You shall not have it, Diomed, faith, you shall not,
CRESSIDA:
I'll give you something else.
DIOMEDES:
I will have this: whose was it?
CRESSIDA:
It is no matter.
DIOMEDES:
Come, tell me whose it was.
CRESSIDA:
'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
CRESSIDA:
But, now you have it, take it.
DIOMEDES:
Whose was it?
CRESSIDA:
By all Diana's waiting-women yond,
CRESSIDA:
And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
DIOMEDES:
To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
DIOMEDES:
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
TROILUS:
Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,
TROILUS:
It should be challenged.
CRESSIDA:
Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not,
CRESSIDA:
I will not keep my word.
DIOMEDES:
Why, then, farewell,
DIOMEDES:
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
CRESSIDA:
You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
CRESSIDA:
But it straight starts you.
DIOMEDES:
I do not like this fooling.
THERSITES:
Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.
DIOMEDES:
What, shall I come? the hour?
CRESSIDA:
Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.
DIOMEDES:
Farewell till then.
CRESSIDA:
Good night: I prithee, come.
CRESSIDA:
Exit DIOMEDES
CRESSIDA:
Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee
CRESSIDA:
But with my heart the other eye doth see.
CRESSIDA:
Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
CRESSIDA:
The error of our eye directs our mind
CRESSIDA:
What error leads must err, O, then conclude
CRESSIDA:
Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.
CRESSIDA:
Exit
THERSITES:
A proof of strength she could not publish more,
THERSITES:
Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'
ULYSSES:
All's done, my lord.
TROILUS:
It is.
ULYSSES:
Why stay we, then?
TROILUS:
To make a recordation to my soul
TROILUS:
Of every syllable that here was spoke.
TROILUS:
But if I tell how these two did co-act,
TROILUS:
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
TROILUS:
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
TROILUS:
An esperance so obstinately strong,
TROILUS:
That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,
TROILUS:
As if those organs had deceptious functions,
TROILUS:
Created only to calumniate.
TROILUS:
Was Cressid here?
ULYSSES:
I cannot conjure, Trojan.
TROILUS:
She was not, sure.
ULYSSES:
Most sure she was.
TROILUS:
Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.
ULYSSES:
Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
TROILUS:
Let it not be believed for womanhood!
TROILUS:
Think, we had mothers, do not give advantage
TROILUS:
To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,
TROILUS:
For depravation, to square the general sex
TROILUS:
By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.
ULYSSES:
What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?
TROILUS:
Nothing at all, unless that this were she.
THERSITES:
Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
TROILUS:
This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida
TROILUS:
If beauty have a soul, this is not she,
TROILUS:
If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
TROILUS:
If sanctimony be the gods' delight,
TROILUS:
If there be rule in unity itself,
TROILUS:
This is not she. O madness of discourse,
TROILUS:
That cause sets up with and against itself!
TROILUS:
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
TROILUS:
Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
TROILUS:
Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.
TROILUS:
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
TROILUS:
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
TROILUS:
Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
TROILUS:
And yet the spacious breadth of this division
TROILUS:
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
TROILUS:
As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
TROILUS:
Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates,
TROILUS:
Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven
TROILUS:
Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself,
TROILUS:
The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed,
TROILUS:
And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
TROILUS:
The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
TROILUS:
The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics
TROILUS:
Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.
ULYSSES:
May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
ULYSSES:
With that which here his passion doth express?
TROILUS:
Ay, Greek, and that shall be divulged well
TROILUS:
In characters as red as Mars his heart
TROILUS:
Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
TROILUS:
With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
TROILUS:
Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
TROILUS:
So much by weight hate I her Diomed
TROILUS:
That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm,
TROILUS:
Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,
TROILUS:
My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
TROILUS:
Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
TROILUS:
Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,
TROILUS:
Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
TROILUS:
In his descent than shall my prompted sword
TROILUS:
Falling on Diomed.
THERSITES:
He'll tickle it for his concupy.
TROILUS:
O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!
TROILUS:
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
TROILUS:
And they'll seem glorious.
ULYSSES:
O, contain yourself
ULYSSES:
Your passion draws ears hither.
ULYSSES:
Enter AENEAS
AENEAS:
I have been seeking you this hour, my lord
AENEAS:
Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy,
AENEAS:
Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.
TROILUS:
Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.
TROILUS:
Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,
TROILUS:
Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!
ULYSSES:
I'll bring you to the gates.
TROILUS:
Accept distracted thanks.
TROILUS:
Exeunt TROILUS, AENEAS, and ULYSSES
THERSITES:
Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
THERSITES:
croak like a raven, I would bode, I would bode.
THERSITES:
Patroclus will give me any thing for the
THERSITES:
intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
THERSITES:
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
THERSITES:
Lechery, lechery, still, wars and lechery, nothing
THERSITES:
else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!
THERSITES:
Exit
THERSITES:
SCENE III. Troy. Before Priam's palace.
THERSITES:
Enter HECTOR and ANDROMACHE
ANDROMACHE:
When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,
ANDROMACHE:
To stop his ears against admonishment?
ANDROMACHE:
Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.
HECTOR:
You train me to offend you, get you in
HECTOR:
By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!
ANDROMACHE:
My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.
HECTOR:
No more, I say.
HECTOR:
Enter CASSANDRA
CASSANDRA:
Where is my brother Hector?
ANDROMACHE:
Here, sister, arm'd, and bloody in intent.
ANDROMACHE:
Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
ANDROMACHE:
Pursue we him on knees, for I have dream'd
ANDROMACHE:
Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
ANDROMACHE:
Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
CASSANDRA:
O, 'tis true.
HECTOR:
Ho! bid my trumpet sound!
CASSANDRA:
No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.
HECTOR:
Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.
CASSANDRA:
The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows
CASSANDRA:
They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd
CASSANDRA:
Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.
ANDROMACHE:
O, be persuaded! do not count it holy
ANDROMACHE:
To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,
ANDROMACHE:
For we would give much, to use violent thefts,
ANDROMACHE:
And rob in the behalf of charity.
CASSANDRA:
It is the purpose that makes strong the vow,
CASSANDRA:
But vows to every purpose must not hold
CASSANDRA:
Unarm, sweet Hector.
HECTOR:
Hold you still, I say,
HECTOR:
Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate
HECTOR:
Lie every man holds dear, but the brave man
HECTOR:
Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.
HECTOR:
Enter TROILUS
HECTOR:
How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?
ANDROMACHE:
Cassandra, call my father to persuade.
ANDROMACHE:
Exit CASSANDRA
HECTOR:
No, faith, young Troilus, doff thy harness, youth,
HECTOR:
I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry
HECTOR:
Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
HECTOR:
And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
HECTOR:
Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
HECTOR:
I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.
TROILUS:
Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
TROILUS:
Which better fits a lion than a man.
HECTOR:
What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.
TROILUS:
When many times the captive Grecian falls,
TROILUS:
Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
TROILUS:
You bid them rise, and live.
HECTOR:
O,'tis fair play.
TROILUS:
Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.
HECTOR:
How now! how now!
TROILUS:
For the love of all the gods,
TROILUS:
Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,
TROILUS:
And when we have our armours buckled on,
TROILUS:
The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,
TROILUS:
Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.
HECTOR:
Fie, savage, fie!
TROILUS:
Hector, then 'tis wars.
HECTOR:
Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.
TROILUS:
Who should withhold me?
TROILUS:
Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
TROILUS:
Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire,
TROILUS:
Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
TROILUS:
Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears,
TROILUS:
Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
TROILUS:
Opposed to  hinder me, should stop my way,
TROILUS:
But by my ruin.
TROILUS:
Re-enter CASSANDRA, with PRIAM
CASSANDRA:
Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast
CASSANDRA:
He is thy crutch, now if thou lose thy stay,
CASSANDRA:
Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
CASSANDRA:
Fall all together.
PRIAM:
Come, Hector, come, go back
PRIAM:
Thy wife hath dream'd, thy mother hath had visions,
PRIAM:
Cassandra doth foresee, and I myself
PRIAM:
Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
PRIAM:
To tell thee that this day is ominous
PRIAM:
Therefore, come back.
HECTOR:
AEneas is a-field,
HECTOR:
And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
HECTOR:
Even in the faith of valour, to appear
HECTOR:
This morning to them.
PRIAM:
Ay, but thou shalt not go.
HECTOR:
I must not break my faith.
HECTOR:
You know me dutiful, therefore, dear sir,
HECTOR:
Let me not shame respect, but give me leave
HECTOR:
To take that course by your consent and voice,
HECTOR:
Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.
CASSANDRA:
O Priam, yield not to him!
ANDROMACHE:
Do not, dear father.
HECTOR:
Andromache, I am offended with you
HECTOR:
Upon the love you bear me, get you in.
HECTOR:
Exit ANDROMACHE
TROILUS:
This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
TROILUS:
Makes all these bodements.
CASSANDRA:
O, farewell, dear Hector!
CASSANDRA:
Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!
CASSANDRA:
Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
CASSANDRA:
Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!
CASSANDRA:
How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
CASSANDRA:
Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,
CASSANDRA:
Like witless antics, one another meet,
CASSANDRA:
And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!
TROILUS:
Away! away!
CASSANDRA:
Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave
CASSANDRA:
Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.
CASSANDRA:
Exit
HECTOR:
You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim
HECTOR:
Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
HECTOR:
Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.
PRIAM:
Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!
PRIAM:
Exeunt severally PRIAM and HECTOR. Alarums
TROILUS:
They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
TROILUS:
I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.
TROILUS:
Enter PANDARUS
PANDARUS:
Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?
TROILUS:
What now?
PANDARUS:
Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.
TROILUS:
Let me read.
PANDARUS:
A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so
PANDARUS:
troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl,
PANDARUS:
and what one thing, what another, that I shall
PANDARUS:
leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum
PANDARUS:
in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones
PANDARUS:
that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what
PANDARUS:
to think on't. What says she there?
TROILUS:
Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart
TROILUS:
The effect doth operate another way.
TROILUS:
Tearing the letter
TROILUS:
Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.
TROILUS:
My love with words and errors still she feeds,
TROILUS:
But edifies another with her deeds.
TROILUS:
Exeunt severally
TROILUS:
SCENE IV. Plains between Troy and the Grecian camp.
TROILUS:
Alarums: excursions. Enter THERSITES
THERSITES:
Now they are clapper-clawing one another, I'll go
THERSITES:
look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,
THERSITES:
has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's
THERSITES:
sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see
THERSITES:
them meet, that that same young Trojan ass, that
THERSITES:
loves the whore there, might send that Greekish
THERSITES:
whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the
THERSITES:
dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.
THERSITES:
O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty
THERSITES:
swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry
THERSITES:
cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is
THERSITES:
not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in
THERSITES:
policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of
THERSITES:
as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax
THERSITES:
prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm
THERSITES:
to-day, whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim
THERSITES:
barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.
THERSITES:
Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.
THERSITES:
Enter DIOMEDES, TROILUS following
TROILUS:
Fly not, for shouldst thou take the river Styx,
TROILUS:
I would swim after.
DIOMEDES:
Thou dost miscall retire
DIOMEDES:
I do not fly, but advantageous care
DIOMEDES:
Withdrew me from the odds of multitude
DIOMEDES:
Have at thee!
THERSITES:
Hold thy whore, Grecian!--now for thy whore,
THERSITES:
Trojan!--now the sleeve, now the sleeve!
THERSITES:
Exeunt TROILUS and DIOMEDES, fighting
THERSITES:
Enter HECTOR
HECTOR:
What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?
HECTOR:
Art thou of blood and honour?
THERSITES:
No, no, I am a rascal, a scurvy railing knave
THERSITES:
a very filthy rogue.
HECTOR:
I do believe thee: live.
HECTOR:
Exit
THERSITES:
God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me, but a
THERSITES:
plague break thy neck for frightening me! What's
THERSITES:
become of the wenching rogues? I think they have
THERSITES:
swallowed one another: I would laugh at that
THERSITES:
miracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.
THERSITES:
I'll seek them.
THERSITES:
Exit
THERSITES:
SCENE V. Another part of the plains.
THERSITES:
Enter DIOMEDES and a Servant
DIOMEDES:
Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse,
DIOMEDES:
Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid
DIOMEDES:
Fellow, commend my service to her beauty,
DIOMEDES:
Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,
DIOMEDES:
And am her knight by proof.
Servant:
I go, my lord.
Servant:
Exit
Servant:
Enter AGAMEMNON
AGAMEMNON:
Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas
AGAMEMNON:
Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
AGAMEMNON:
Hath Doreus prisoner,
AGAMEMNON:
And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
AGAMEMNON:
Upon the pashed corses of the kings
AGAMEMNON:
Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,
AGAMEMNON:
Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
AGAMEMNON:
Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes
AGAMEMNON:
Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary
AGAMEMNON:
Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,
AGAMEMNON:
To reinforcement, or we perish all.
AGAMEMNON:
Enter NESTOR
NESTOR:
Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles,
NESTOR:
And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
NESTOR:
There is a thousand Hectors in the field
NESTOR:
Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,
NESTOR:
And there lacks work, anon he's there afoot,
NESTOR:
And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
NESTOR:
Before the belching whale, then is he yonder,
NESTOR:
And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
NESTOR:
Fall down before him, like the mower's swath
NESTOR:
Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,
NESTOR:
Dexterity so obeying appetite
NESTOR:
That what he will he does, and does so much
NESTOR:
That proof is call'd impossibility.
NESTOR:
Enter ULYSSES
ULYSSES:
O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles
ULYSSES:
Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance
ULYSSES:
Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,
ULYSSES:
Together with his mangled Myrmidons,
ULYSSES:
That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,
ULYSSES:
Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend
ULYSSES:
And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
ULYSSES:
Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
ULYSSES:
Mad and fantastic execution,
ULYSSES:
Engaging and redeeming of himself
ULYSSES:
With such a careless force and forceless care
ULYSSES:
As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,
ULYSSES:
Bade him win all.
ULYSSES:
Enter AJAX
AJAX:
Troilus! thou coward Troilus!
AJAX:
Exit
DIOMEDES:
Ay, there, there.

So, so, we draw together.

ACHILLES:
Where is this Hector?

Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face,

Know what it is to meet Achilles angry

ACHILLES:
Exeunt

AJAX:
Enter DIOMEDES
DIOMEDES:
Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?
AJAX:
What wouldst thou?
DIOMEDES:
I would correct him.
AJAX:
Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
AJAX:
Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!
AJAX:
Enter TROILUS
TROILUS:
O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,
TROILUS:
And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!
DIOMEDES:
Ha, art thou there?
AJAX:
I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.
DIOMEDES:
He is my prize, I will not look upon.
TROILUS:
Come, both you cogging Greeks, have at you both!
TROILUS:
Exeunt, fighting
TROILUS:
Enter HECTOR
HECTOR:
Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!
HECTOR:
Enter ACHILLES
ACHILLES:
Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!
HECTOR:
Pause, if thou wilt.
ACHILLES:
I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan
ACHILLES:
Be happy that my arms are out of use
ACHILLES:
My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
ACHILLES:
But thou anon shalt hear of me again,
ACHILLES:
Till when, go seek thy fortune.
ACHILLES:
Exit
HECTOR:
Fare thee well
HECTOR:
I would have been much more a fresher man,
HECTOR:
Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!
HECTOR:
Re-enter TROILUS
TROILUS:
Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?
TROILUS:
No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
TROILUS:
He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too,
TROILUS:
Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
TROILUS:
I reck not though I end my life to-day.
TROILUS:
Exit
TROILUS:
Enter one in sumptuous armour
HECTOR:
Stand, stand, thou Greek, thou art a goodly mark
HECTOR:
No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well,
HECTOR:
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
HECTOR:
But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not,
HECTOR:
beast, abide?
HECTOR:
Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
HECTOR:
Exeunt
HECTOR:
SCENE VII. Another part of the plains.
HECTOR:
Enter ACHILLES, with Myrmidons
ACHILLES:
Come here about me, you my Myrmidons,
ACHILLES:
Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel
ACHILLES:
Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath
ACHILLES:
And when I have the bloody Hector found,
ACHILLES:
Empale him with your weapons round about,
ACHILLES:
In fellest manner execute your aims.
ACHILLES:
Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye
ACHILLES:
It is decreed Hector the great must die.
ACHILLES:
Exeunt
ACHILLES:
Enter MENELAUS and PARIS, fighting: then THERSITES
THERSITES:
The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now,
THERSITES:
bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double-
THERSITES:
henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the
THERSITES:
game: ware horns, ho!
THERSITES:
Exeunt PARIS and MENELAUS
THERSITES:
Enter MARGARELON
MARGARELON:
Turn, slave, and fight.
THERSITES:
What art thou?
MARGARELON:
A bastard son of Priam's.
THERSITES:
I am a bastard too, I love bastards: I am a bastard
THERSITES:
begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard
THERSITES:
in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will
THERSITES:
not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?
THERSITES:
Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the
THERSITES:
son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment
THERSITES:
farewell, bastard.
THERSITES:
Exit
MARGARELON:
The devil take thee, coward!
MARGARELON:

SCENE VIII. Another part of the plains.
MARGARELON:

HECTOR:
Most putrefied core, so fair without,
HECTOR:
Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
HECTOR:
Now is my day's work done, I'll take good breath
HECTOR:
Rest, sword, thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
HECTOR:
Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him
HECTOR:
Enter ACHILLES and Myrmidons
ACHILLES:
Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set,
ACHILLES:
How ugly night comes breathing at his heels
ACHILLES:
Even with the vail and darking of the sun,
ACHILLES:
To close the day up, Hector's life is done.
HECTOR:
I am unarm'd, forego this vantage, Greek.
ACHILLES:
Strike, fellows, strike, this is the man I seek.
ACHILLES:
HECTOR falls
ACHILLES:
So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!
ACHILLES:
Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
ACHILLES:
On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
ACHILLES:
'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'
ACHILLES:
A retreat sounded
ACHILLES:
Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.
MYRMIDONS:
The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.
ACHILLES:
The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,
ACHILLES:
And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
ACHILLES:
My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,
ACHILLES:
Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
ACHILLES:
Sheathes his sword
ACHILLES:
Come, tie his body to my horse's tail,
ACHILLES:
Along the field I will the Trojan trail.
ACHILLES:
Exeunt
ACHILLES:
SCENE IX. Another part of the plains.
ACHILLES:
Enter AGAMEMNON, AJAX, MENELAUS, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and others, marching. Shouts within

Hark! hark! what shout is that?
NESTOR:
Peace, drums!
NESTOR:
Within
NESTOR:
Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.
DIOMEDES:
The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
AJAX:
If it be so, yet bragless let it be,
AJAX:
Great Hector was a man as good as he.
AGAMEMNON:
March patiently along: let one be sent
AGAMEMNON:
To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
AGAMEMNON:
If in his death the gods have us befriended,
AGAMEMNON:
Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
AGAMEMNON:
Exeunt, marching
AGAMEMNON:
SCENE X. Another part of the plains.
AGAMEMNON:
Enter AENEAS and Trojans
AENEAS:
Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field
AENEAS:
Never go home, here starve we out the night.
AENEAS:
Enter TROILUS
TROILUS:
Hector is slain.
ALL:
Hector! the gods forbid!
TROILUS:
He's dead, and at the murderer's horse's tail,
TROILUS:
In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
TROILUS:
Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
TROILUS:
Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
TROILUS:
I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
TROILUS:
And linger not our sure destructions on!
AENEAS:
My lord, you do discomfort all the host!
TROILUS:
You understand me not that tell me so
TROILUS:
I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
TROILUS:
But dare all imminence that gods and men
TROILUS:
Address their dangers in. Hector is gone
TROILUS:
Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
TROILUS:
Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,
TROILUS:
Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead
TROILUS:
There is a word will Priam turn to stone,
TROILUS:
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
TROILUS:
Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
TROILUS:
Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away
TROILUS:
Hector is dead, there is no more to say.
TROILUS:
Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
TROILUS:
Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
TROILUS:
Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
TROILUS:
I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,
TROILUS:
No space of earth shall sunder our two hates
TROILUS:
I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
TROILUS:
That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
TROILUS:
Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go
TROILUS:
Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
TROILUS:
Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans
TROILUS:
As TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other side, PANDARUS
PANDARUS:
But hear you, hear you!
TROILUS:
Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame
TROILUS:
Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!
TROILUS:
Exit
PANDARUS:
A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!
PANDARUS:
world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!
PANDARUS:
O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set
PANDARUS:
a-work, and how ill requited! why should our
PANDARUS:
endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
PANDARUS:
what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see
PANDARUS:
Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,
PANDARUS:
Till he hath lost his honey and his sting,
PANDARUS:
And being once subdued in armed tail,
PANDARUS:
Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
PANDARUS:
Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
PANDARUS:
painted cloths.
PANDARUS:
As many as be here of pander's hall,
PANDARUS:
Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall,
PANDARUS:
Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
PANDARUS:
Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
PANDARUS:
Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
PANDARUS:
Some two months hence my will shall here be made
PANDARUS:
It should be now, but that my fear is this,
PANDARUS:
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss
PANDARUS:
Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,
PANDARUS:
And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.
PANDARUS:
Exit
