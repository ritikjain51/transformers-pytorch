ACT I
PANDARUS:
SCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
PANDARUS:
Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords, Musicians attending
DUKE ORSINO:
If music be the food of love, play on,
DUKE ORSINO:
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
DUKE ORSINO:
The appetite may sicken, and so die.
DUKE ORSINO:
That strain again! it had a dying fall
DUKE ORSINO:
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
DUKE ORSINO:
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
DUKE ORSINO:
Stealing and giving odour! Enough, no more
DUKE ORSINO:
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
DUKE ORSINO:
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
DUKE ORSINO:
That, notwithstanding thy capacity
DUKE ORSINO:
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
DUKE ORSINO:
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
DUKE ORSINO:
But falls into abatement and low price,
DUKE ORSINO:
Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
DUKE ORSINO:
That it alone is high fantastical.
CURIO:
Will you go hunt, my lord?
DUKE ORSINO:
What, Curio?
CURIO:
The hart.
DUKE ORSINO:
Why, so I do, the noblest that I have
DUKE ORSINO:
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
DUKE ORSINO:
Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
DUKE ORSINO:
That instant was I turn'd into a hart,
DUKE ORSINO:
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
DUKE ORSINO:
E'er since pursue me.
DUKE ORSINO:
Enter VALENTINE
DUKE ORSINO:
How now! what news from her?
VALENTINE:
So please my lord, I might not be admitted,
VALENTINE:
But from her handmaid do return this answer
VALENTINE:
The element itself, till seven years' heat,
VALENTINE:
Shall not behold her face at ample view,
VALENTINE:
But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
VALENTINE:
And water once a day her chamber round
VALENTINE:
With eye-offending brine: all this to season
VALENTINE:
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
VALENTINE:
And lasting in her sad remembrance.
DUKE ORSINO:
O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
DUKE ORSINO:
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
DUKE ORSINO:
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
DUKE ORSINO:
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
DUKE ORSINO:
That live in her, when liver, brain and heart,
DUKE ORSINO:
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
DUKE ORSINO:
Her sweet perfections with one self king!
DUKE ORSINO:
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers
DUKE ORSINO:
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
DUKE ORSINO:
Exeunt
DUKE ORSINO:
SCENE II. The sea-coast.
DUKE ORSINO:
Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors
VIOLA:
What country, friends, is this?
Captain:
This is Illyria, lady.
VIOLA:
And what should I do in Illyria?
VIOLA:
My brother he is in Elysium.
VIOLA:
Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?
Captain:
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
VIOLA:
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
Captain:
True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
Captain:
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
Captain:
When you and those poor number saved with you
Captain:
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
Captain:
Most provident in peril, bind himself,
Captain:
Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
Captain:
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,
Captain:
Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
Captain:
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
Captain:
So long as I could see.
VIOLA:
For saying so, there's gold
VIOLA:
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
VIOLA:
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
VIOLA:
The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
Captain:
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born
Captain:
Not three hours' travel from this very place.
VIOLA:
Who governs here?
Captain:
A noble duke, in nature as in name.
VIOLA:
What is the name?
Captain:
Orsino.
VIOLA:
Orsino! I have heard my father name him
VIOLA:
He was a bachelor then.
Captain:
And so is now, or was so very late,
Captain:
For but a month ago I went from hence,
Captain:
And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
Captain:
What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
Captain:
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
VIOLA:
What's she?
Captain:
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
Captain:
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
Captain:
In the protection of his son, her brother,
Captain:
Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
Captain:
They say, she hath abjured the company
Captain:
And sight of men.
VIOLA:
O that I served that lady
VIOLA:
And might not be delivered to the world,
VIOLA:
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
VIOLA:
What my estate is!
Captain:
That were hard to compass,
Captain:
Because she will admit no kind of suit,
Captain:
No, not the duke's.
VIOLA:
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,
VIOLA:
And though that nature with a beauteous wall
VIOLA:
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
VIOLA:
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
VIOLA:
With this thy fair and outward character.
VIOLA:
I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
VIOLA:
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
VIOLA:
For such disguise as haply shall become
VIOLA:
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke
VIOLA:
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him
VIOLA:
It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing
VIOLA:
And speak to him in many sorts of music
VIOLA:
That will allow me very worth his service.
VIOLA:
What else may hap to time I will commit,
VIOLA:
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
Captain:
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be
Captain:
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
VIOLA:
I thank thee: lead me on.
VIOLA:
Exeunt
VIOLA:
SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.
VIOLA:
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH:
What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
SIR TOBY BELCH:
her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
MARIA:
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
MARIA:
nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
MARIA:
exceptions to your ill hours.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Why, let her except, before excepted.
MARIA:
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
MARIA:
limits of order.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am
SIR TOBY BELCH:
these clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be
SIR TOBY BELCH:
these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
SIR TOBY BELCH:
themselves in their own straps.
MARIA:
That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
MARIA:
my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish
MARIA:
knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
MARIA:
Ay, he.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
MARIA:
What's that to the purpose?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
MARIA:
Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats
MARIA:
he's a very fool and a prodigal.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
SIR TOBY BELCH:
viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
SIR TOBY BELCH:
word for word without book, and hath all the good
SIR TOBY BELCH:
gifts of nature.
MARIA:
He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
MARIA:
he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
MARIA:
he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
MARIA:
hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
MARIA:
he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
SIR TOBY BELCH:
that say so of him. Who are they?
MARIA:
They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
SIR TOBY BELCH:
her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
SIR TOBY BELCH:
drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
SIR TOBY BELCH:
that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
SIR TOBY BELCH:
o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter SIR ANDREW
SIR ANDREW:
Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Sweet Sir Andrew!
SIR ANDREW:
Bless you, fair shrew.
MARIA:
And you too, sir.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
SIR ANDREW:
What's that?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
My niece's chambermaid.
SIR ANDREW:
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
MARIA:
My name is Mary, sir.
SIR ANDREW:
Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
SIR TOBY BELCH:
You mistake, knight, 'accost' is front her, board
SIR TOBY BELCH:
her, woo her, assail her.
SIR ANDREW:
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
SIR ANDREW:
company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
MARIA:
Fare you well, gentlemen.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
SIR TOBY BELCH:
never draw sword again.
SIR ANDREW:
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
SIR ANDREW:
draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
SIR ANDREW:
fools in hand?
MARIA:
Sir, I have not you by the hand.
SIR ANDREW:
Marry, but you shall have, and here's my hand.
MARIA:
Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
MARIA:
your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
SIR ANDREW:
Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?
MARIA:
It's dry, sir.
SIR ANDREW:
Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
SIR ANDREW:
keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
MARIA:
A dry jest, sir.
SIR ANDREW:
Are you full of them?
MARIA:
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
MARIA:
now I let go your hand, I am barren.
MARIA:
Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH:
O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
SIR TOBY BELCH:
see thee so put down?
SIR ANDREW:
Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary
SIR ANDREW:
put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
SIR ANDREW:
than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
SIR ANDREW:
great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
No question.
SIR ANDREW:
An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
SIR ANDREW:
to-morrow, Sir Toby.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Pourquoi, my dear knight?
SIR ANDREW:
What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
SIR ANDREW:
bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
SIR ANDREW:
fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
SIR ANDREW:
followed the arts!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
SIR ANDREW:
Why, would that have mended my hair?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
SIR ANDREW:
But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I
SIR TOBY BELCH:
hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
SIR TOBY BELCH:
and spin it off.
SIR ANDREW:
Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
SIR ANDREW:
will not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one
SIR ANDREW:
she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
SIR TOBY BELCH:
her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit, I
SIR TOBY BELCH:
have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
man.
SIR ANDREW:
I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
SIR ANDREW:
strangest mind i' the world, I delight in masques
SIR ANDREW:
and revels sometimes altogether.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
SIR ANDREW:
As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
SIR ANDREW:
degree of my betters, and yet I will not compare
SIR ANDREW:
with an old man.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
SIR ANDREW:
Faith, I can cut a caper.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
And I can cut the mutton to't.
SIR ANDREW:
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
SIR ANDREW:
as any man in Illyria.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
SIR TOBY BELCH:
these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
SIR TOBY BELCH:
take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
SIR TOBY BELCH:
thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
SIR TOBY BELCH:
a coranto? My very walk should be a jig, I would not
SIR TOBY BELCH:
so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
SIR TOBY BELCH:
dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
SIR TOBY BELCH:
leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
SIR ANDREW:
Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
SIR ANDREW:
flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
SIR ANDREW:
Taurus! That's sides and heart.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see the
SIR TOBY BELCH:
caper, ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Exeunt
SIR TOBY BELCH:
SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire
VALENTINE:
If the duke continue these favours towards you,
VALENTINE:
Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
VALENTINE:
known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
VIOLA:
You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
VIOLA:
you call in question the continuance of his love
VIOLA:
is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
VALENTINE:
No, believe me.
VIOLA:
I thank you. Here comes the count.
VIOLA:
Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants
DUKE ORSINO:
Who saw Cesario, ho?
VIOLA:
On your attendance, my lord, here.
DUKE ORSINO:
Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,
DUKE ORSINO:
Thou know'st no less but all, I have unclasp'd
DUKE ORSINO:
To thee the book even of my secret soul
DUKE ORSINO:
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her,
DUKE ORSINO:
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
DUKE ORSINO:
And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
DUKE ORSINO:
Till thou have audience.
VIOLA:
Sure, my noble lord,
VIOLA:
If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
VIOLA:
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
DUKE ORSINO:
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
DUKE ORSINO:
Rather than make unprofited return.
VIOLA:
Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
DUKE ORSINO:
O, then unfold the passion of my love,
DUKE ORSINO:
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith
DUKE ORSINO:
It shall become thee well to act my woes,
DUKE ORSINO:
She will attend it better in thy youth
DUKE ORSINO:
Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
VIOLA:
I think not so, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO:
Dear lad, believe it,
DUKE ORSINO:
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
DUKE ORSINO:
That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
DUKE ORSINO:
Is not more smooth and rubious, thy small pipe
DUKE ORSINO:
Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
DUKE ORSINO:
And all is semblative a woman's part.
DUKE ORSINO:
I know thy constellation is right apt
DUKE ORSINO:
For this affair. Some four or five attend him,
DUKE ORSINO:
All, if you will, for I myself am best
DUKE ORSINO:
When least in company. Prosper well in this,
DUKE ORSINO:
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
DUKE ORSINO:
To call his fortunes thine.
VIOLA:
I'll do my best
VIOLA:
To woo your lady
VIOLA:
Aside
VIOLA:
yet, a barful strife!
VIOLA:
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
VIOLA:
Exeunt
VIOLA:
SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.
VIOLA:
Enter MARIA and Clown
MARIA:
Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
MARIA:
not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
MARIA:
way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
Clown:
Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
Clown:
world needs to fear no colours.
MARIA:
Make that good.
Clown:
He shall see none to fear.
MARIA:
A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
MARIA:
saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'
Clown:
Where, good Mistress Mary?
MARIA:
In the wars, and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
Clown:
Well, God give them wisdom that have it, and those
Clown:
that are fools, let them use their talents.
MARIA:
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent, or,
MARIA:
to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
Clown:
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage, and,
Clown:
for turning away, let summer bear it out.
MARIA:
You are resolute, then?
Clown:
Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.
MARIA:
That if one break, the other will hold, or, if both
MARIA:
break, your gaskins fall.
Clown:
Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way, if
Clown:
Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
Clown:
piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
MARIA:
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my
MARIA:
lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.
MARIA:
Exit
Clown:
Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
Clown:
Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
Clown:
prove fools, and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
Clown:
pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
Clown:
'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
Clown:
Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO
Clown:
God bless thee, lady!
OLIVIA:
Take the fool away.
Clown:
Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
OLIVIA:
Go to, you're a dry fool, I'll no more of you
OLIVIA:
besides, you grow dishonest.
Clown:
Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
Clown:
will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
Clown:
the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
Clown:
himself, if he mend, he is no longer dishonest, if
Clown:
he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
Clown:
that's mended is but patched: virtue that
Clown:
transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that
Clown:
amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
Clown:
simple syllogism will serve, so, if it will not,
Clown:
what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
Clown:
calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
Clown:
away the fool, therefore, I say again, take her away.
OLIVIA:
Sir, I bade them take away you.
Clown:
Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
Clown:
facit monachum, that's as much to say as I wear not
Clown:
motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
Clown:
prove you a fool.
OLIVIA:
Can you do it?
Clown:
Dexterously, good madonna.
OLIVIA:
Make your proof.
Clown:
I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
Clown:
of virtue, answer me.
OLIVIA:
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.
Clown:
Good madonna, why mournest thou?
OLIVIA:
Good fool, for my brother's death.
Clown:
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
OLIVIA:
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
Clown:
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
Clown:
soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
OLIVIA:
What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
MALVOLIO:
Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him
MALVOLIO:
infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
MALVOLIO:
better fool.
Clown:
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
Clown:
better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
Clown:
sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his
Clown:
word for two pence that you are no fool.
OLIVIA:
How say you to that, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO:
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
MALVOLIO:
barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
MALVOLIO:
with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
MALVOLIO:
than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
MALVOLIO:
already, unless you laugh and minister occasion to
MALVOLIO:
him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
MALVOLIO:
that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
MALVOLIO:
than the fools' zanies.
OLIVIA:
Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
OLIVIA:
with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
OLIVIA:
guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
OLIVIA:
things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets
OLIVIA:
there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
OLIVIA:
nothing but rail, nor no railing in a known discreet
OLIVIA:
man, though he do nothing but reprove.
Clown:
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
Clown:
speakest well of fools!
Clown:
Re-enter MARIA
MARIA:
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much
MARIA:
desires to speak with you.
OLIVIA:
From the Count Orsino, is it?
MARIA:
I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
OLIVIA:
Who of my people hold him in delay?
MARIA:
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
OLIVIA:
Fetch him off, I pray you, he speaks nothing but
OLIVIA:
madman: fie on him!
OLIVIA:
Exit MARIA
OLIVIA:
Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I
OLIVIA:
am sick, or not at home, what you will, to dismiss it.
OLIVIA:
Exit MALVOLIO
OLIVIA:
Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
OLIVIA:
people dislike it.
Clown:
Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
Clown:
son should be a fool, whose skull Jove cram with
Clown:
brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a
Clown:
most weak pia mater.
Clown:
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH
OLIVIA:
By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
A gentleman.
OLIVIA:
A gentleman! what gentleman?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
SIR TOBY BELCH:
pickle-herring! How now, sot!
Clown:
Good Sir Toby!
OLIVIA:
Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
OLIVIA:
Ay, marry, what is he?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give
SIR TOBY BELCH:
me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Exit
OLIVIA:
What's a drunken man like, fool?
Clown:
Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
Clown:
draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads
Clown:
him, and a third drowns him.
OLIVIA:
Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my
OLIVIA:
coz, for he's in the third degree of drink, he's
OLIVIA:
drowned: go, look after him.
Clown:
He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look
Clown:
to the madman.
Clown:
Exit
Clown:
Re-enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO:
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with
MALVOLIO:
you. I told him you were sick, he takes on him to
MALVOLIO:
understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
MALVOLIO:
with you. I told him you were asleep, he seems to
MALVOLIO:
have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
MALVOLIO:
comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
MALVOLIO:
lady? he's fortified against any denial.
OLIVIA:
Tell him he shall not speak with me.
MALVOLIO:
Has been told so, and he says, he'll stand at your
MALVOLIO:
door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to
MALVOLIO:
a bench, but he'll speak with you.
OLIVIA:
What kind o' man is he?
MALVOLIO:
Why, of mankind.
OLIVIA:
What manner of man?
MALVOLIO:
Of very ill manner, he'll speak with you, will you or no.
OLIVIA:
Of what personage and years is he?
MALVOLIO:
Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
MALVOLIO:
a boy, as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a
MALVOLIO:
cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
MALVOLIO:
in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
MALVOLIO:
well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly, one
MALVOLIO:
would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
OLIVIA:
Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.
MALVOLIO:
Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
MALVOLIO:
Exit
MALVOLIO:
Re-enter MARIA
OLIVIA:
Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
OLIVIA:
We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
OLIVIA:
Enter VIOLA, and Attendants
VIOLA:
The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
OLIVIA:
Speak to me, I shall answer for her.
OLIVIA:
Your will?
VIOLA:
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
VIOLA:
pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
VIOLA:
for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
VIOLA:
my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
VIOLA:
penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
VIOLA:
beauties, let me sustain no scorn, I am very
VIOLA:
comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
OLIVIA:
Whence came you, sir?
VIOLA:
I can say little more than I have studied, and that
VIOLA:
question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
VIOLA:
modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
VIOLA:
that I may proceed in my speech.
OLIVIA:
Are you a comedian?
VIOLA:
No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
VIOLA:
of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
VIOLA:
the lady of the house?
OLIVIA:
If I do not usurp myself, I am.
VIOLA:
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
VIOLA:
yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours
VIOLA:
to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
VIOLA:
on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
VIOLA:
the heart of my message.
OLIVIA:
Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
VIOLA:
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
OLIVIA:
It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
OLIVIA:
keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
OLIVIA:
and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
OLIVIA:
than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone, if
OLIVIA:
you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of
OLIVIA:
moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
MARIA:
Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.
VIOLA:
No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little
VIOLA:
longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
VIOLA:
lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
OLIVIA:
Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
OLIVIA:
the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
VIOLA:
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
VIOLA:
war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
VIOLA:
hand, my words are as fun of peace as matter.
OLIVIA:
Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
VIOLA:
The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
VIOLA:
learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
VIOLA:
would, are as secret as maidenhead, to your ears,
VIOLA:
divinity, to any other's, profanation.
OLIVIA:
Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
OLIVIA:
Exeunt MARIA and Attendants
OLIVIA:
Now, sir, what is your text?
VIOLA:
Most sweet lady,--
OLIVIA:
A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
OLIVIA:
Where lies your text?
VIOLA:
In Orsino's bosom.
OLIVIA:
In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
VIOLA:
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
OLIVIA:
O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
VIOLA:
Good madam, let me see your face.
OLIVIA:
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
OLIVIA:
with my face? You are now out of your text: but
OLIVIA:
we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
OLIVIA:
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
OLIVIA:
not well done?
OLIVIA:
Unveiling
VIOLA:
Excellently done, if God did all.
OLIVIA:
'Tis in grain, sir, 'twill endure wind and weather.
VIOLA:
'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
VIOLA:
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on
VIOLA:
Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
VIOLA:
If you will lead these graces to the grave
VIOLA:
And leave the world no copy.
OLIVIA:
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted, I will give
OLIVIA:
out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
OLIVIA:
inventoried, and every particle and utensil
OLIVIA:
labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
OLIVIA:
indifferent red, item, two grey eyes, with lids to
OLIVIA:
them, item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
OLIVIA:
you sent hither to praise me?
VIOLA:
I see you what you are, you are too proud,
VIOLA:
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
VIOLA:
My lord and master loves you: O, such love
VIOLA:
Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
VIOLA:
The nonpareil of beauty!
OLIVIA:
How does he love me?
VIOLA:
With adorations, fertile tears,
VIOLA:
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
OLIVIA:
Your lord does know my mind, I cannot love him
OLIVIA:
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
OLIVIA:
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth,
OLIVIA:
In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant,
OLIVIA:
And in dimension and the shape of nature
OLIVIA:
A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him,
OLIVIA:
He might have took his answer long ago.
VIOLA:
If I did love you in my master's flame,
VIOLA:
With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
VIOLA:
In your denial I would find no sense,
VIOLA:
I would not understand it.
OLIVIA:
Why, what would you?
VIOLA:
Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
VIOLA:
And call upon my soul within the house,
VIOLA:
Write loyal cantons of contemned love
VIOLA:
And sing them loud even in the dead of night,
VIOLA:
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
VIOLA:
And make the babbling gossip of the air
VIOLA:
Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
VIOLA:
Between the elements of air and earth,
VIOLA:
But you should pity me!
OLIVIA:
You might do much.
OLIVIA:
What is your parentage?
VIOLA:
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well
VIOLA:
I am a gentleman.
OLIVIA:
Get you to your lord,
OLIVIA:
I cannot love him: let him send no more,
OLIVIA:
Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
OLIVIA:
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well
OLIVIA:
I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
VIOLA:
I am no fee'd post, lady, keep your purse
VIOLA:
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
VIOLA:
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,
VIOLA:
And let your fervor, like my master's, be
VIOLA:
Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
VIOLA:
Exit
OLIVIA:
'What is your parentage?'
OLIVIA:
'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well
OLIVIA:
I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art,
OLIVIA:
Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,
OLIVIA:
Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast
OLIVIA:
soft, soft!
OLIVIA:
Unless the master were the man. How now!
OLIVIA:
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
OLIVIA:
Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
OLIVIA:
With an invisible and subtle stealth
OLIVIA:
To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
OLIVIA:
What ho, Malvolio!
OLIVIA:
Re-enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO:
Here, madam, at your service.
OLIVIA:
Run after that same peevish messenger,
OLIVIA:
The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
OLIVIA:
Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
OLIVIA:
Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
OLIVIA:
Nor hold him up with hopes, I am not for him
OLIVIA:
If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
OLIVIA:
I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.
MALVOLIO:
Madam, I will.
MALVOLIO:
Exit
OLIVIA:
I do I know not what, and fear to find
OLIVIA:
Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
OLIVIA:
Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe,
OLIVIA:
What is decreed must be, and be this so.
OLIVIA:
Exit
OLIVIA:
ACT II
OLIVIA:
SCENE I. The sea-coast.
OLIVIA:
Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
ANTONIO:
Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
SEBASTIAN:
By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
SEBASTIAN:
me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
SEBASTIAN:
distemper yours, therefore I shall crave of you your
SEBASTIAN:
leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
SEBASTIAN:
recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
SEBASTIAN:
ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
SEBASTIAN:
No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
SEBASTIAN:
extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
SEBASTIAN:
touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
SEBASTIAN:
what I am willing to keep in, therefore it charges
SEBASTIAN:
me in manners the rather to express myself. You
SEBASTIAN:
must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
SEBASTIAN:
which I called Roderigo. My father was that
SEBASTIAN:
Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
SEBASTIAN:
of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
SEBASTIAN:
born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
SEBASTIAN:
would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that,
SEBASTIAN:
for some hour before you took me from the breach of
SEBASTIAN:
the sea was my sister drowned.
ANTONIO:
Alas the day!
SEBASTIAN:
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
SEBASTIAN:
me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
SEBASTIAN:
though I could not with such estimable wonder
SEBASTIAN:
overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
SEBASTIAN:
publish her, she bore a mind that envy could not but
SEBASTIAN:
call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
SEBASTIAN:
water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
ANTONIO:
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
SEBASTIAN:
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
ANTONIO:
If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
ANTONIO:
your servant.
SEBASTIAN:
If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
SEBASTIAN:
kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
SEBASTIAN:
Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
SEBASTIAN:
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
SEBASTIAN:
upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
SEBASTIAN:
tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
SEBASTIAN:
Exit
ANTONIO:
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
ANTONIO:
I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
ANTONIO:
Else would I very shortly see thee there.
ANTONIO:
But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
ANTONIO:
That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
ANTONIO:
Exit
ANTONIO:
SCENE II. A street.
ANTONIO:
Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following
MALVOLIO:
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
VIOLA:
Even now, sir, on a moderate pace I have since
VIOLA:
arrived but hither.
MALVOLIO:
She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
MALVOLIO:
saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
MALVOLIO:
She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
MALVOLIO:
into a desperate assurance she will none of him
MALVOLIO:
and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
MALVOLIO:
come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
MALVOLIO:
your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
VIOLA:
She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
MALVOLIO:
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and her
MALVOLIO:
will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
MALVOLIO:
stooping for, there it lies in your eye, if not, be
MALVOLIO:
it his that finds it.
MALVOLIO:
Exit
VIOLA:
I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
VIOLA:
Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
VIOLA:
She made good view of me, indeed, so much,
VIOLA:
That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
VIOLA:
For she did speak in starts distractedly.
VIOLA:
She loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion
VIOLA:
Invites me in this churlish messenger.
VIOLA:
None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
VIOLA:
I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
VIOLA:
Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
VIOLA:
Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
VIOLA:
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
VIOLA:
How easy is it for the proper-false
VIOLA:
In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
VIOLA:
Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
VIOLA:
For such as we are made of, such we be.
VIOLA:
How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly,
VIOLA:
And I, poor monster, fond as much on him,
VIOLA:
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
VIOLA:
What will become of this? As I am man,
VIOLA:
My state is desperate for my master's love,
VIOLA:
As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
VIOLA:
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
VIOLA:
O time! thou must untangle this, not I,
VIOLA:
It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
VIOLA:
Exit
VIOLA:
SCENE III. OLIVIA's house.
VIOLA:
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after
SIR TOBY BELCH:
midnight is to be up betimes, and 'diluculo
SIR TOBY BELCH:
surgere,' thou know'st,--
SIR ANDREW:
Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up
SIR ANDREW:
late is to be up late.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is
SIR TOBY BELCH:
early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
SIR TOBY BELCH:
to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the
SIR TOBY BELCH:
four elements?
SIR ANDREW:
Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists
SIR ANDREW:
of eating and drinking.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Thou'rt a scholar, let us therefore eat and drink.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter Clown
SIR ANDREW:
Here comes the fool, i' faith.
Clown:
How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture
Clown:
of 'we three'?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.
SIR ANDREW:
By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I
SIR ANDREW:
had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,
SIR ANDREW:
and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In
SIR ANDREW:
sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last
SIR ANDREW:
night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the
SIR ANDREW:
Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas
SIR ANDREW:
very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy
SIR ANDREW:
leman: hadst it?
Clown:
I did impeticos thy gratillity, for Malvolio's nose
Clown:
is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the
Clown:
Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
SIR ANDREW:
Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all
SIR ANDREW:
is done. Now, a song.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Come on, there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.
SIR ANDREW:
There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--
Clown:
Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
A love-song, a love-song.
SIR ANDREW:
Ay, ay: I care not for good life.
Clown:
[Sings]
Clown:
O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
Clown:
O, stay and hear, your true love's coming,
Clown:
That can sing both high and low
Clown:
Trip no further, pretty sweeting,
Clown:
Journeys end in lovers meeting,
Clown:
Every wise man's son doth know.
SIR ANDREW:
Excellent good, i' faith.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Good, good.
Clown:
[Sings]
Clown:
What is love? 'tis not hereafter,
Clown:
Present mirth hath present laughter,
Clown:
What's to come is still unsure
Clown:
In delay there lies no plenty,
Clown:
Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,
Clown:
Youth's a stuff will not endure.
SIR ANDREW:
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
A contagious breath.
SIR ANDREW:
Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we
SIR TOBY BELCH:
rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
SIR TOBY BELCH:
souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
SIR ANDREW:
An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.
Clown:
By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
SIR ANDREW:
Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'
Clown:
'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be
Clown:
constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.
SIR ANDREW:
'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to
SIR ANDREW:
call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'
Clown:
I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
SIR ANDREW:
Good, i' faith. Come, begin.
SIR ANDREW:
Catch sung
SIR ANDREW:
Enter MARIA
MARIA:
What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady
MARIA:
have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him
MARIA:
turn you out of doors, never trust me.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's
SIR TOBY BELCH:
a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Tillyvally. Lady!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Sings
SIR TOBY BELCH:
'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'
Clown:
Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
SIR ANDREW:
Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do
SIR ANDREW:
I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it
SIR ANDREW:
more natural.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
[Sings]  'O, the twelfth day of December,'--
MARIA:
For the love o' God, peace!
MARIA:
Enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO:
My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye
MALVOLIO:
no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like
MALVOLIO:
tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an
MALVOLIO:
alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your
MALVOLIO:
coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse
MALVOLIO:
of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
MALVOLIO:
time in you?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
MALVOLIO:
Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me
MALVOLIO:
tell you, that, though she harbours you as her
MALVOLIO:
kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If
MALVOLIO:
you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you
MALVOLIO:
are welcome to the house, if not, an it would please
MALVOLIO:
you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid
MALVOLIO:
you farewell.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'
MARIA:
Nay, good Sir Toby.
Clown:
'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'
MALVOLIO:
Is't even so?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
'But I will never die.'
Clown:
Sir Toby, there you lie.
MALVOLIO:
This is much credit to you.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
'Shall I bid him go?'
Clown:
'What an if you do?'
SIR TOBY BELCH:
'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'
Clown:
'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a
SIR TOBY BELCH:
steward? Dost thou think, because thou art
SIR TOBY BELCH:
virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
Clown:
Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the
Clown:
mouth too.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with
SIR TOBY BELCH:
crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!
MALVOLIO:
Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any
MALVOLIO:
thing more than contempt, you would not give means
MALVOLIO:
for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.
MALVOLIO:
Exit
MARIA:
Go shake your ears.
SIR ANDREW:
'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's
SIR ANDREW:
a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to
SIR ANDREW:
break promise with him and make a fool of him.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll
SIR TOBY BELCH:
deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
MARIA:
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the
MARIA:
youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is
MARIA:
much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me
MARIA:
alone with him: if I do not gull him into a
MARIA:
nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
MARIA:
think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed
MARIA:
I know I can do it.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him.
MARIA:
Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
SIR ANDREW:
O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
dear knight?
SIR ANDREW:
I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason
SIR ANDREW:
good enough.
MARIA:
The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing
MARIA:
constantly, but a time-pleaser, an affectioned ass,
MARIA:
that cons state without book and utters it by great
MARIA:
swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
MARIA:
crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is
MARIA:
his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
MARIA:
him, and on that vice in him will my revenge find
MARIA:
notable cause to work.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
What wilt thou do?
MARIA:
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
MARIA:
love, wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
MARIA:
of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
MARIA:
of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
MARIA:
himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
MARIA:
like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
MARIA:
can hardly make distinction of our hands.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Excellent! I smell a device.
SIR ANDREW:
I have't in my nose too.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
that they come from my niece, and that she's in
SIR TOBY BELCH:
love with him.
MARIA:
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
SIR ANDREW:
And your horse now would make him an ass.
MARIA:
Ass, I doubt not.
SIR ANDREW:
O, 'twill be admirable!
MARIA:
Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will
MARIA:
work with him. I will plant you two, and let the
MARIA:
fool make a third, where he shall find the letter
MARIA:
observe his construction of it. For this night, to
MARIA:
bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
MARIA:
Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Good night, Penthesilea.
SIR ANDREW:
Before me, she's a good wench.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me
SIR TOBY BELCH:
what o' that?
SIR ANDREW:
I was adored once too.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for
SIR TOBY BELCH:
more money.
SIR ANDREW:
If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'
SIR TOBY BELCH:
the end, call me cut.
SIR ANDREW:
If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Come, come, I'll go burn some sack, 'tis too late
SIR TOBY BELCH:
to go to bed now: come, knight, come, knight.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Exeunt
SIR TOBY BELCH:
SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others
DUKE ORSINO:
Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
DUKE ORSINO:
Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
DUKE ORSINO:
That old and antique song we heard last night
DUKE ORSINO:
Methought it did relieve my passion much,
DUKE ORSINO:
More than light airs and recollected terms
DUKE ORSINO:
Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times
DUKE ORSINO:
Come, but one verse.
CURIO:
He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.
DUKE ORSINO:
Who was it?
CURIO:
Feste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the lady
CURIO:
Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.
DUKE ORSINO:
Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
DUKE ORSINO:
Exit CURIO. Music plays
DUKE ORSINO:
Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
DUKE ORSINO:
In the sweet pangs of it remember me,
DUKE ORSINO:
For such as I am all true lovers are,
DUKE ORSINO:
Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
DUKE ORSINO:
Save in the constant image of the creature
DUKE ORSINO:
That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
VIOLA:
It gives a very echo to the seat
VIOLA:
Where Love is throned.
DUKE ORSINO:
Thou dost speak masterly
DUKE ORSINO:
My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
DUKE ORSINO:
Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves
DUKE ORSINO:
Hath it not, boy?
VIOLA:
A little, by your favour.
DUKE ORSINO:
What kind of woman is't?
VIOLA:
Of your complexion.
DUKE ORSINO:
She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
VIOLA:
About your years, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO:
Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
DUKE ORSINO:
An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
DUKE ORSINO:
So sways she level in her husband's heart
DUKE ORSINO:
For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
DUKE ORSINO:
Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
DUKE ORSINO:
More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
DUKE ORSINO:
Than women's are.
VIOLA:
I think it well, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO:
Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
DUKE ORSINO:
Or thy affection cannot hold the bent,
DUKE ORSINO:
For women are as roses, whose fair flower
DUKE ORSINO:
Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.
VIOLA:
And so they are: alas, that they are so,
VIOLA:
To die, even when they to perfection grow!
VIOLA:
Re-enter CURIO and Clown
DUKE ORSINO:
O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
DUKE ORSINO:
Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain,
DUKE ORSINO:
The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
DUKE ORSINO:
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
DUKE ORSINO:
Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
DUKE ORSINO:
And dallies with the innocence of love,
DUKE ORSINO:
Like the old age.
Clown:
Are you ready, sir?
DUKE ORSINO:
Ay, prithee, sing.
DUKE ORSINO:
Music
DUKE ORSINO:
SONG.
Clown:
Come away, come away, death,
Clown:
And in sad cypress let me be laid,
Clown:
Fly away, fly away breath,
Clown:
I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
Clown:
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
Clown:
O, prepare it!
Clown:
My part of death, no one so true
Clown:
Did share it.
Clown:
Not a flower, not a flower sweet
Clown:
On my black coffin let there be strown,
Clown:
Not a friend, not a friend greet
Clown:
My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown
Clown:
A thousand thousand sighs to save,
Clown:
Lay me, O, where
Clown:
Sad true lover never find my grave,
Clown:
To weep there!
DUKE ORSINO:
There's for thy pains.
Clown:
No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.
DUKE ORSINO:
I'll pay thy pleasure then.
Clown:
Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
DUKE ORSINO:
Give me now leave to leave thee.
Clown:
Now, the melancholy god protect thee, and the
Clown:
tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
Clown:
thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
Clown:
constancy put to sea, that their business might be
Clown:
every thing and their intent every where, for that's
Clown:
it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
Clown:
Exit
DUKE ORSINO:
Let all the rest give place.
DUKE ORSINO:
CURIO and Attendants retire
DUKE ORSINO:
Once more, Cesario,
DUKE ORSINO:
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
DUKE ORSINO:
Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
DUKE ORSINO:
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands,
DUKE ORSINO:
The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
DUKE ORSINO:
Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune,
DUKE ORSINO:
But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
DUKE ORSINO:
That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
VIOLA:
But if she cannot love you, sir?
DUKE ORSINO:
I cannot be so answer'd.
VIOLA:
Sooth, but you must.
VIOLA:
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
VIOLA:
Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
VIOLA:
As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her,
VIOLA:
You tell her so, must she not then be answer'd?
DUKE ORSINO:
There is no woman's sides
DUKE ORSINO:
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
DUKE ORSINO:
As love doth give my heart, no woman's heart
DUKE ORSINO:
So big, to hold so much, they lack retention
DUKE ORSINO:
Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
DUKE ORSINO:
No motion of the liver, but the palate,
DUKE ORSINO:
That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt,
DUKE ORSINO:
But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
DUKE ORSINO:
And can digest as much: make no compare
DUKE ORSINO:
Between that love a woman can bear me
DUKE ORSINO:
And that I owe Olivia.
VIOLA:
Ay, but I know--
DUKE ORSINO:
What dost thou know?
VIOLA:
Too well what love women to men may owe
VIOLA:
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
VIOLA:
My father had a daughter loved a man,
VIOLA:
As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
VIOLA:
I should your lordship.
DUKE ORSINO:
And what's her history?
VIOLA:
A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
VIOLA:
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
VIOLA:
Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
VIOLA:
And with a green and yellow melancholy
VIOLA:
She sat like patience on a monument,
VIOLA:
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
VIOLA:
We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
VIOLA:
Our shows are more than will, for still we prove
VIOLA:
Much in our vows, but little in our love.
DUKE ORSINO:
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
VIOLA:
I am all the daughters of my father's house,
VIOLA:
And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
VIOLA:
Sir, shall I to this lady?
DUKE ORSINO:
Ay, that's the theme.
DUKE ORSINO:
To her in haste, give her this jewel, say,
DUKE ORSINO:
My love can give no place, bide no denay.
DUKE ORSINO:
Exeunt
DUKE ORSINO:
SCENE V. OLIVIA's garden.
DUKE ORSINO:
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
FABIAN:
Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,
FABIAN:
let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
SIR TOBY BELCH:
rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
FABIAN:
I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'
FABIAN:
favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
To anger him we'll have the bear again, and we will
SIR TOBY BELCH:
fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?
SIR ANDREW:
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Here comes the little villain.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH:
How now, my metal of India!
MARIA:
Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
MARIA:
coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
MARIA:
sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
MARIA:
hour: observe him, for the love of mockery, for I
MARIA:
know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
MARIA:
him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,
MARIA:
Throws down a letter
MARIA:
for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
MARIA:
Exit
MARIA:
Enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO:
'Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told
MALVOLIO:
me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
MALVOLIO:
thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one
MALVOLIO:
of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
MALVOLIO:
exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
MALVOLIO:
What should I think on't?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Here's an overweening rogue!
FABIAN:
O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock
FABIAN:
of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
SIR ANDREW:
'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Peace, I say.
MALVOLIO:
To be Count Malvolio!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Ah, rogue!
SIR ANDREW:
Pistol him, pistol him.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Peace, peace!
MALVOLIO:
There is example for't, the lady of the Strachy
MALVOLIO:
married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
SIR ANDREW:
Fie on him, Jezebel!
FABIAN:
O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how
FABIAN:
imagination blows him.
MALVOLIO:
Having been three months married to her, sitting in
MALVOLIO:
my state,--
SIR TOBY BELCH:
O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
MALVOLIO:
Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet
MALVOLIO:
gown, having come from a day-bed, where I have left
MALVOLIO:
Olivia sleeping,--
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Fire and brimstone!
FABIAN:
O, peace, peace!
MALVOLIO:
And then to have the humour of state, and after a
MALVOLIO:
demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
MALVOLIO:
place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
MALVOLIO:
kinsman Toby,--
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Bolts and shackles!
FABIAN:
O peace, peace, peace! now, now.
MALVOLIO:
Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
MALVOLIO:
out for him: I frown the while, and perchance wind
MALVOLIO:
up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
MALVOLIO:
approaches, courtesies there to me,--
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Shall this fellow live?
FABIAN:
Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
MALVOLIO:
I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar
MALVOLIO:
smile with an austere regard of control,--
SIR TOBY BELCH:
And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
MALVOLIO:
Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on
MALVOLIO:
your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--
SIR TOBY BELCH:
What, what?
MALVOLIO:
'You must amend your drunkenness.'
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Out, scab!
FABIAN:
Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
MALVOLIO:
'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with
MALVOLIO:
a foolish knight,'--
SIR ANDREW:
That's me, I warrant you.
MALVOLIO:
'One Sir Andrew,'--
SIR ANDREW:
I knew 'twas I, for many do call me fool.
MALVOLIO:
What employment have we here?
MALVOLIO:
Taking up the letter
FABIAN:
Now is the woodcock near the gin.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading
SIR TOBY BELCH:
aloud to him!
MALVOLIO:
By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her
MALVOLIO:
very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her
MALVOLIO:
great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
SIR ANDREW:
Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?
MALVOLIO:
[Reads]  'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
MALVOLIO:
wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
MALVOLIO:
Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she
MALVOLIO:
uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?
FABIAN:
This wins him, liver and all.
MALVOLIO:
[Reads]
MALVOLIO:
Jove knows I love: But who?
MALVOLIO:
Lips, do not move,
MALVOLIO:
No man must know.
MALVOLIO:
'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
MALVOLIO:
altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
MALVOLIO:
thee, Malvolio?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Marry, hang thee, brock!
MALVOLIO:
[Reads]
MALVOLIO:
I may command where I adore,
MALVOLIO:
But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
MALVOLIO:
With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore
MALVOLIO:
M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.
FABIAN:
A fustian riddle!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Excellent wench, say I.
MALVOLIO:
'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let
MALVOLIO:
me see, let me see, let me see.
FABIAN:
What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!
MALVOLIO:
'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command
MALVOLIO:
me: I serve her, she is my lady. Why, this is
MALVOLIO:
evident to any formal capacity, there is no
MALVOLIO:
obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
MALVOLIO:
that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
MALVOLIO:
that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,
MALVOLIO:
I,--
SIR TOBY BELCH:
O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.
FABIAN:
Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as
FABIAN:
rank as a fox.
MALVOLIO:
M,--Malvolio, M,--why, that begins my name.
FABIAN:
Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
FABIAN:
excellent at faults.
MALVOLIO:
M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel,
MALVOLIO:
that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.
FABIAN:
And O shall end, I hope.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!
MALVOLIO:
And then I comes behind.
FABIAN:
Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see
FABIAN:
more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
FABIAN:
you.
MALVOLIO:
M, O, A, I, this simulation is not as the former: and
MALVOLIO:
yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
MALVOLIO:
every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
MALVOLIO:
here follows prose.
MALVOLIO:
Reads
MALVOLIO:
'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
MALVOLIO:
am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness: some
MALVOLIO:
are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
MALVOLIO:
have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
MALVOLIO:
their hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them,
MALVOLIO:
and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
MALVOLIO:
cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
MALVOLIO:
opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants, let
MALVOLIO:
thy tongue tang arguments of state, put thyself into
MALVOLIO:
the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
MALVOLIO:
that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
MALVOLIO:
yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
MALVOLIO:
cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
MALVOLIO:
made, if thou desirest to be so, if not, let me see
MALVOLIO:
thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
MALVOLIO:
not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
MALVOLIO:
She that would alter services with thee,
MALVOLIO:
THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'
MALVOLIO:
Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
MALVOLIO:
open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
MALVOLIO:
I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
MALVOLIO:
acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
MALVOLIO:
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
MALVOLIO:
me, for every reason excites to this, that my lady
MALVOLIO:
loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
MALVOLIO:
late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered,
MALVOLIO:
and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
MALVOLIO:
with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
MALVOLIO:
of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
MALVOLIO:
be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
MALVOLIO:
cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
MALVOLIO:
on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
MALVOLIO:
postscript.
MALVOLIO:
Reads
MALVOLIO:
'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
MALVOLIO:
entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling,
MALVOLIO:
thy smiles become thee well, therefore in my
MALVOLIO:
presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
MALVOLIO:
Jove, I thank thee: I will smile, I will do
MALVOLIO:
everything that thou wilt have me.
MALVOLIO:
Exit
FABIAN:
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
FABIAN:
of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I could marry this wench for this device.
SIR ANDREW:
So could I too.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
SIR ANDREW:
Nor I neither.
FABIAN:
Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
FABIAN:
Re-enter MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
SIR ANDREW:
Or o' mine either?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy
SIR TOBY BELCH:
bond-slave?
SIR ANDREW:
I' faith, or I either?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when
SIR TOBY BELCH:
the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
MARIA:
Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
MARIA:
If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark
MARIA:
his first approach before my lady: he will come to
MARIA:
her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she
MARIA:
abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests,
MARIA:
and he will smile upon her, which will now be so
MARIA:
unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
MARIA:
melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him
MARIA:
into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow
MARIA:
me.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
SIR ANDREW:
I'll make one too.
SIR ANDREW:
Exeunt
SIR ANDREW:
ACT III
SIR ANDREW:
SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.
SIR ANDREW:
Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour
VIOLA:
Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
VIOLA:
thy tabour?
Clown:
No, sir, I live by the church.
VIOLA:
Art thou a churchman?
Clown:
No such matter, sir: I do live by the church, for
Clown:
I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
Clown:
the church.
VIOLA:
So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a
VIOLA:
beggar dwell near him, or, the church stands by thy
VIOLA:
tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.
Clown:
You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
Clown:
but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
Clown:
wrong side may be turned outward!
VIOLA:
Nay, that's certain, they that dally nicely with
VIOLA:
words may quickly make them wanton.
Clown:
I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
VIOLA:
Why, man?
Clown:
Why, sir, her name's a word, and to dally with that
Clown:
word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
Clown:
are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
VIOLA:
Thy reason, man?
Clown:
Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and
Clown:
words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
Clown:
reason with them.
VIOLA:
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
Clown:
Not so, sir, I do care for something, but in my
Clown:
conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
Clown:
to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
VIOLA:
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
Clown:
No, indeed, sir, the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
Clown:
will keep no fool, sir, till she be married, and
Clown:
fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
Clown:
herrings, the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
Clown:
her fool, but her corrupter of words.
VIOLA:
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
Clown:
Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
Clown:
it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
Clown:
the fool should be as oft with your master as with
Clown:
my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
VIOLA:
Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
VIOLA:
Hold, there's expenses for thee.
Clown:
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
VIOLA:
By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
VIOLA:
one,
VIOLA:
Aside
VIOLA:
though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
VIOLA:
lady within?
Clown:
Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
VIOLA:
Yes, being kept together and put to use.
Clown:
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring
Clown:
a Cressida to this Troilus.
VIOLA:
I understand you, sir, 'tis well begged.
Clown:
The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but
Clown:
a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
Clown:
within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
Clown:
come, who you are and what you would are out of my
Clown:
welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.
Clown:
Exit
VIOLA:
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool,
VIOLA:
And to do that well craves a kind of wit
VIOLA:
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
VIOLA:
The quality of persons, and the time,
VIOLA:
And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
VIOLA:
That comes before his eye. This is a practise
VIOLA:
As full of labour as a wise man's art
VIOLA:
For folly that he wisely shows is fit,
VIOLA:
But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
VIOLA:
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Save you, gentleman.
VIOLA:
And you, sir.
SIR ANDREW:
Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
VIOLA:
Et vous aussi, votre serviteur.
SIR ANDREW:
I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
SIR TOBY BELCH:
you should enter, if your trade be to her.
VIOLA:
I am bound to your niece, sir, I mean, she is the
VIOLA:
list of my voyage.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Taste your legs, sir, put them to motion.
VIOLA:
My legs do better understand me, sir, than I
VIOLA:
understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
VIOLA:
I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
VIOLA:
are prevented.
VIOLA:
Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
VIOLA:
Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
VIOLA:
odours on you!
SIR ANDREW:
That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours,' well.
VIOLA:
My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant
VIOLA:
and vouchsafed ear.
SIR ANDREW:
'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em
SIR ANDREW:
all three all ready.
OLIVIA:
Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
OLIVIA:
Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA
OLIVIA:
Give me your hand, sir.
VIOLA:
My duty, madam, and most humble service.
OLIVIA:
What is your name?
VIOLA:
Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
OLIVIA:
My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
OLIVIA:
Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment
OLIVIA:
You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
VIOLA:
And he is yours, and his must needs be yours
VIOLA:
Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
OLIVIA:
For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
OLIVIA:
Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!
VIOLA:
Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
VIOLA:
On his behalf.
OLIVIA:
O, by your leave, I pray you,
OLIVIA:
I bade you never speak again of him
OLIVIA:
But, would you undertake another suit,
OLIVIA:
I had rather hear you to solicit that
OLIVIA:
Than music from the spheres.
VIOLA:
Dear lady,--
OLIVIA:
Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
OLIVIA:
After the last enchantment you did here,
OLIVIA:
A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
OLIVIA:
Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you
OLIVIA:
Under your hard construction must I sit,
OLIVIA:
To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
OLIVIA:
Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
OLIVIA:
Have you not set mine honour at the stake
OLIVIA:
And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
OLIVIA:
That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
OLIVIA:
Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
OLIVIA:
Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
VIOLA:
I pity you.
OLIVIA:
That's a degree to love.
VIOLA:
No, not a grize, for 'tis a vulgar proof,
VIOLA:
That very oft we pity enemies.
OLIVIA:
Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
OLIVIA:
O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
OLIVIA:
If one should be a prey, how much the better
OLIVIA:
To fall before the lion than the wolf!
OLIVIA:
Clock strikes
OLIVIA:
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
OLIVIA:
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you
OLIVIA:
And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
OLIVIA:
Your were is alike to reap a proper man
OLIVIA:
There lies your way, due west.
VIOLA:
Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
VIOLA:
Attend your ladyship!
VIOLA:
You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
OLIVIA:
Stay
OLIVIA:
I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
VIOLA:
That you do think you are not what you are.
OLIVIA:
If I think so, I think the same of you.
VIOLA:
Then think you right: I am not what I am.
OLIVIA:
I would you were as I would have you be!
VIOLA:
Would it be better, madam, than I am?
VIOLA:
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
OLIVIA:
O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
OLIVIA:
In the contempt and anger of his lip!
OLIVIA:
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
OLIVIA:
Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
OLIVIA:
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
OLIVIA:
By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
OLIVIA:
I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
OLIVIA:
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
OLIVIA:
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
OLIVIA:
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
OLIVIA:
But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
OLIVIA:
Love sought is good, but given unsought better.
VIOLA:
By innocence I swear, and by my youth
VIOLA:
I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,
VIOLA:
And that no woman has, nor never none
VIOLA:
Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
VIOLA:
And so adieu, good madam: never more
VIOLA:
Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
OLIVIA:
Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move
OLIVIA:
That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
OLIVIA:
Exeunt
OLIVIA:
SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.
OLIVIA:
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
SIR ANDREW:
No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
FABIAN:
You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
SIR ANDREW:
Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the
SIR ANDREW:
count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me,
SIR ANDREW:
I saw't i' the orchard.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
SIR ANDREW:
As plain as I see you now.
FABIAN:
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
SIR ANDREW:
'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
FABIAN:
I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
FABIAN:
judgment and reason.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah
SIR TOBY BELCH:
was a sailor.
FABIAN:
She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
FABIAN:
to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
FABIAN:
put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
FABIAN:
You should then have accosted her, and with some
FABIAN:
excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
FABIAN:
have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
FABIAN:
looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
FABIAN:
double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
FABIAN:
off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
FABIAN:
lady's opinion, where you will hang like an icicle
FABIAN:
on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by
FABIAN:
some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
SIR ANDREW:
An't be any way, it must be with valour, for policy
SIR ANDREW:
I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
SIR ANDREW:
politician.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
SIR TOBY BELCH:
valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
SIR TOBY BELCH:
with him, hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
SIR TOBY BELCH:
take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no
SIR TOBY BELCH:
love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
SIR TOBY BELCH:
commendation with woman than report of valour.
FABIAN:
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
SIR ANDREW:
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
SIR TOBY BELCH:
of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink
SIR TOBY BELCH:
if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be
SIR TOBY BELCH:
amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
SIR TOBY BELCH:
paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
SIR TOBY BELCH:
bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
SIR TOBY BELCH:
write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.
SIR ANDREW:
Where shall I find you?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Exit SIR ANDREW
FABIAN:
This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand
SIR TOBY BELCH:
strong, or so.
FABIAN:
We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
FABIAN:
not deliver't?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Never trust me, then, and by all means stir on the
SIR TOBY BELCH:
youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
SIR TOBY BELCH:
cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
SIR TOBY BELCH:
opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
SIR TOBY BELCH:
will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of
SIR TOBY BELCH:
the anatomy.
FABIAN:
And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no
FABIAN:
great presage of cruelty.
FABIAN:
Enter MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.
MARIA:
If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself
MARIA:
into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is
MARIA:
turned heathen, a very renegado, for there is no
MARIA:
Christian, that means to be saved by believing
MARIA:
rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages
MARIA:
of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
And cross-gartered?
MARIA:
Most villanously, like a pedant that keeps a school
MARIA:
i' the church. I have dogged him, like his
MARIA:
murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
MARIA:
that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
MARIA:
face into more lines than is in the new map with the
MARIA:
augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
MARIA:
a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
MARIA:
at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,
MARIA:
he'll smile and take't for a great favour.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Exeunt
SIR TOBY BELCH:
SCENE III. A street.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
SEBASTIAN:
I would not by my will have troubled you,
SEBASTIAN:
But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
SEBASTIAN:
I will no further chide you.
ANTONIO:
I could not stay behind you: my desire,
ANTONIO:
More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth,
ANTONIO:
And not all love to see you, though so much
ANTONIO:
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
ANTONIO:
But jealousy what might befall your travel,
ANTONIO:
Being skilless in these parts, which to a stranger,
ANTONIO:
Unguided and unfriended, often prove
ANTONIO:
Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
ANTONIO:
The rather by these arguments of fear,
ANTONIO:
Set forth in your pursuit.
SEBASTIAN:
My kind Antonio,
SEBASTIAN:
I can no other answer make but thanks,
SEBASTIAN:
And thanks, and ever [         ] oft good turns
SEBASTIAN:
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay
SEBASTIAN:
But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
SEBASTIAN:
You should find better dealing. What's to do?
SEBASTIAN:
Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
ANTONIO:
To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.
SEBASTIAN:
I am not weary, and 'tis long to night
SEBASTIAN:
I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
SEBASTIAN:
With the memorials and the things of fame
SEBASTIAN:
That do renown this city.
ANTONIO:
Would you'ld pardon me,
ANTONIO:
I do not without danger walk these streets
ANTONIO:
Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
ANTONIO:
I did some service, of such note indeed,
ANTONIO:
That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
SEBASTIAN:
Belike you slew great number of his people.
ANTONIO:
The offence is not of such a bloody nature,
ANTONIO:
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
ANTONIO:
Might well have given us bloody argument.
ANTONIO:
It might have since been answer'd in repaying
ANTONIO:
What we took from them, which, for traffic's sake,
ANTONIO:
Most of our city did: only myself stood out,
ANTONIO:
For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
ANTONIO:
I shall pay dear.
SEBASTIAN:
Do not then walk too open.
ANTONIO:
It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.
ANTONIO:
In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
ANTONIO:
Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
ANTONIO:
Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
ANTONIO:
With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
SEBASTIAN:
Why I your purse?
ANTONIO:
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
ANTONIO:
You have desire to purchase, and your store,
ANTONIO:
I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
SEBASTIAN:
I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you
SEBASTIAN:
For an hour.
ANTONIO:
To the Elephant.
SEBASTIAN:
I do remember.
SEBASTIAN:
Exeunt
SEBASTIAN:
SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.
SEBASTIAN:
Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
OLIVIA:
I have sent after him: he says he'll come,
OLIVIA:
How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
OLIVIA:
For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
OLIVIA:
I speak too loud.
OLIVIA:
Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,
OLIVIA:
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes
OLIVIA:
Where is Malvolio?
MARIA:
He's coming, madam, but in very strange manner. He
MARIA:
is, sure, possessed, madam.
OLIVIA:
Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
MARIA:
No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
MARIA:
ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if
MARIA:
he come, for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.
OLIVIA:
Go call him hither.
OLIVIA:
Exit MARIA
OLIVIA:
I am as mad as he,
OLIVIA:
If sad and merry madness equal be.
OLIVIA:
Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO
OLIVIA:
How now, Malvolio!
MALVOLIO:
Sweet lady, ho, ho.
OLIVIA:
Smilest thou?
OLIVIA:
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
MALVOLIO:
Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
MALVOLIO:
obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering, but
MALVOLIO:
what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is
MALVOLIO:
with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and
MALVOLIO:
please all.'
OLIVIA:
Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
MALVOLIO:
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It
MALVOLIO:
did come to his hands, and commands shall be
MALVOLIO:
executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
OLIVIA:
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO:
To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.
OLIVIA:
God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
OLIVIA:
thy hand so oft?
MARIA:
How do you, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO:
At your request! yes, nightingales answer daws.
MARIA:
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
MALVOLIO:
'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
OLIVIA:
What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO:
'Some are born great,'--
OLIVIA:
Ha!
MALVOLIO:
'Some achieve greatness,'--
OLIVIA:
What sayest thou?
MALVOLIO:
'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
OLIVIA:
Heaven restore thee!
MALVOLIO:
'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--
OLIVIA:
Thy yellow stockings!
MALVOLIO:
'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
OLIVIA:
Cross-gartered!
MALVOLIO:
'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so,'--
OLIVIA:
Am I made?
MALVOLIO:
'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'
OLIVIA:
Why, this is very midsummer madness.
OLIVIA:
Enter Servant
Servant:
Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is
Servant:
returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
Servant:
attends your ladyship's pleasure.
OLIVIA:
I'll come to him.
OLIVIA:
Exit Servant
OLIVIA:
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's
OLIVIA:
my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
OLIVIA:
care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
OLIVIA:
half of my dowry.
OLIVIA:
Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA
MALVOLIO:
O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
MALVOLIO:
Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
MALVOLIO:
the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
MALVOLIO:
appear stubborn to him, for she incites me to that
MALVOLIO:
in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she,
MALVOLIO:
'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants,
MALVOLIO:
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put
MALVOLIO:
thyself into the trick of singularity,' and
MALVOLIO:
consequently sets down the manner how, as, a sad
MALVOLIO:
face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
MALVOLIO:
habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
MALVOLIO:
limed her, but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
MALVOLIO:
thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
MALVOLIO:
fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
MALVOLIO:
after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
MALVOLIO:
adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
MALVOLIO:
scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
MALVOLIO:
or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
MALVOLIO:
that can be can come between me and the full
MALVOLIO:
prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
MALVOLIO:
doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
MALVOLIO:
Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all
SIR TOBY BELCH:
the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion
SIR TOBY BELCH:
himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.
FABIAN:
Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?
FABIAN:
how is't with you, man?
MALVOLIO:
Go off, I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go
MALVOLIO:
off.
MARIA:
Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not
MARIA:
I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a
MARIA:
care of him.
MALVOLIO:
Ah, ha! does she so?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Go to, go to, peace, peace, we must deal gently
SIR TOBY BELCH:
with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how
SIR TOBY BELCH:
is't with you? What, man! defy the devil
SIR TOBY BELCH:
consider, he's an enemy to mankind.
MALVOLIO:
Do you know what you say?
MARIA:
La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes
MARIA:
it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
FABIAN:
Carry his water to the wise woman.
MARIA:
Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I
MARIA:
live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
MALVOLIO:
How now, mistress!
MARIA:
O Lord!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Prithee, hold thy peace, this is not the way: do
SIR TOBY BELCH:
you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
FABIAN:
No way but gentleness, gently, gently: the fiend is
FABIAN:
rough, and will not be roughly used.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?
MALVOLIO:
Sir!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for
SIR TOBY BELCH:
gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
SIR TOBY BELCH:
him, foul collier!
MARIA:
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
MALVOLIO:
My prayers, minx!
MARIA:
No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
MALVOLIO:
Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow
MALVOLIO:
things: I am not of your element: you shall know
MALVOLIO:
more hereafter.
MALVOLIO:
Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Is't possible?
FABIAN:
If this were played upon a stage now, I could
FABIAN:
condemn it as an improbable fiction.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
MARIA:
Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
FABIAN:
Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
MARIA:
The house will be the quieter.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My
SIR TOBY BELCH:
niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we
SIR TOBY BELCH:
may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt
SIR TOBY BELCH:
us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
SIR TOBY BELCH:
bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
SIR TOBY BELCH:
finder of madmen. But see, but see.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter SIR ANDREW
FABIAN:
More matter for a May morning.
SIR ANDREW:
Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
SIR ANDREW:
vinegar and pepper in't.
FABIAN:
Is't so saucy?
SIR ANDREW:
Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Give me.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Reads
SIR TOBY BELCH:
'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'
FABIAN:
Good, and valiant.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
[Reads]  'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'
FABIAN:
A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
[Reads]  'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my
SIR TOBY BELCH:
sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy
SIR TOBY BELCH:
throat, that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'
FABIAN:
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
[Reads]  'I will waylay thee going home, where if it
SIR TOBY BELCH:
be thy chance to kill me,'--
FABIAN:
Good.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
[Reads]  'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'
FABIAN:
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
[Reads]  'Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon
SIR TOBY BELCH:
one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine, but
SIR TOBY BELCH:
my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy
SIR TOBY BELCH:
friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
ANDREW AGUECHEEK.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
If this letter move him not, his legs cannot
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I'll give't him.
MARIA:
You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
MARIA:
some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the
SIR TOBY BELCH:
orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
SIR TOBY BELCH:
him, draw, and, as thou drawest swear horrible, for
SIR TOBY BELCH:
it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a
SIR TOBY BELCH:
swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood
SIR TOBY BELCH:
more approbation than ever proof itself would have
SIR TOBY BELCH:
earned him. Away!
SIR ANDREW:
Nay, let me alone for swearing.
SIR ANDREW:
Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior
SIR TOBY BELCH:
of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
SIR TOBY BELCH:
capacity and breeding, his employment between his
SIR TOBY BELCH:
lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
SIR TOBY BELCH:
letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no
SIR TOBY BELCH:
terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
SIR TOBY BELCH:
clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
SIR TOBY BELCH:
word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report
SIR TOBY BELCH:
of valour, and drive the gentleman, as I know his
SIR TOBY BELCH:
youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous
SIR TOBY BELCH:
opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
This will so fright them both that they will kill
SIR TOBY BELCH:
one another by the look, like cockatrices.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA
FABIAN:
Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
FABIAN:
he take leave, and presently after him.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
SIR TOBY BELCH:
for a challenge.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA
OLIVIA:
I have said too much unto a heart of stone
OLIVIA:
And laid mine honour too unchary out
OLIVIA:
There's something in me that reproves my fault,
OLIVIA:
But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
OLIVIA:
That it but mocks reproof.
VIOLA:
With the same 'havior that your passion bears
VIOLA:
Goes on my master's grief.
OLIVIA:
Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture,
OLIVIA:
Refuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you,
OLIVIA:
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
OLIVIA:
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
OLIVIA:
That honour saved may upon asking give?
VIOLA:
Nothing but this, your true love for my master.
OLIVIA:
How with mine honour may I give him that
OLIVIA:
Which I have given to you?
VIOLA:
I will acquit you.
OLIVIA:
Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well
OLIVIA:
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
OLIVIA:
Exit
OLIVIA:
Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Gentleman, God save thee.
VIOLA:
And you, sir.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what
SIR TOBY BELCH:
nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
SIR TOBY BELCH:
not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
SIR TOBY BELCH:
the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end
SIR TOBY BELCH:
dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
SIR TOBY BELCH:
thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
VIOLA:
You mistake, sir, I am sure no man hath any quarrel
VIOLA:
to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
VIOLA:
any image of offence done to any man.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
SIR TOBY BELCH:
your guard, for your opposite hath in him what
SIR TOBY BELCH:
youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.
VIOLA:
I pray you, sir, what is he?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
SIR TOBY BELCH:
carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private
SIR TOBY BELCH:
brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and
SIR TOBY BELCH:
his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
SIR TOBY BELCH:
and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word, give't or take't.
VIOLA:
I will return again into the house and desire some
VIOLA:
conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
VIOLA:
of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
VIOLA:
others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
VIOLA:
of that quirk.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Sir, no, his indignation derives itself out of a
SIR TOBY BELCH:
very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
SIR TOBY BELCH:
give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
SIR TOBY BELCH:
house, unless you undertake that with me which with
SIR TOBY BELCH:
as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you
SIR TOBY BELCH:
must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
VIOLA:
This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
VIOLA:
this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
VIOLA:
my offence to him is: it is something of my
VIOLA:
negligence, nothing of my purpose.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
SIR TOBY BELCH:
gentleman till my return.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Exit
VIOLA:
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
FABIAN:
I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
FABIAN:
mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more.
VIOLA:
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
FABIAN:
Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
FABIAN:
his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
FABIAN:
of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
FABIAN:
bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
FABIAN:
have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
FABIAN:
towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
FABIAN:
can.
VIOLA:
I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
VIOLA:
had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
VIOLA:
care not who knows so much of my mettle.
VIOLA:
Exeunt
VIOLA:
Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Why, man, he's a very devil, I have not seen such a
SIR TOBY BELCH:
firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
SIR TOBY BELCH:
all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
SIR TOBY BELCH:
motion, that it is inevitable, and on the answer, he
SIR TOBY BELCH:
pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
SIR TOBY BELCH:
step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
SIR ANDREW:
Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
SIR TOBY BELCH:
scarce hold him yonder.
SIR ANDREW:
Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
SIR ANDREW:
cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld
SIR ANDREW:
have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
SIR ANDREW:
and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
SIR TOBY BELCH:
on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Aside
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA
SIR TOBY BELCH:
To FABIAN
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I have his horse to take up the quarrel
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
FABIAN:
He is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and
FABIAN:
looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
[To VIOLA]  There's no remedy, sir, he will fight
SIR TOBY BELCH:
with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better
SIR TOBY BELCH:
bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
SIR TOBY BELCH:
scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
SIR TOBY BELCH:
the supportance of his vow, he protests he will not hurt you.
VIOLA:
[Aside]  Pray God defend me! A little thing would
VIOLA:
make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
FABIAN:
Give ground, if you see him furious.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy, the gentleman
SIR TOBY BELCH:
will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you,
SIR TOBY BELCH:
he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
SIR TOBY BELCH:
promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
SIR TOBY BELCH:
will not hurt you. Come on, to't.
SIR ANDREW:
Pray God, he keep his oath!
VIOLA:
I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
VIOLA:
They draw
VIOLA:
Enter ANTONIO
ANTONIO:
Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
ANTONIO:
Have done offence, I take the fault on me
ANTONIO:
If you offend him, I for him defy you.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
You, sir! why, what are you?
ANTONIO:
One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
ANTONIO:
Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
They draw
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter Officers
FABIAN:
O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I'll be with you anon.
VIOLA:
Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
SIR ANDREW:
Marry, will I, sir, and, for that I promised you,
SIR ANDREW:
I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
SIR ANDREW:
and reins well.
First Officer:
This is the man, do thy office.
Second Officer:
Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
ANTONIO:
You do mistake me, sir.
First Officer:
No, sir, no jot, I know your favour well,
First Officer:
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
First Officer:
Take him away: he knows I know him well.
ANTONIO:
I must obey.
ANTONIO:
To VIOLA
ANTONIO:
This comes with seeking you
ANTONIO:
But there's no remedy, I shall answer it.
ANTONIO:
What will you do, now my necessity
ANTONIO:
Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
ANTONIO:
Much more for what I cannot do for you
ANTONIO:
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed,
ANTONIO:
But be of comfort.
Second Officer:
Come, sir, away.
ANTONIO:
I must entreat of you some of that money.
VIOLA:
What money, sir?
VIOLA:
For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
VIOLA:
And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
VIOLA:
Out of my lean and low ability
VIOLA:
I'll lend you something: my having is not much,
VIOLA:
I'll make division of my present with you
VIOLA:
Hold, there's half my coffer.
ANTONIO:
Will you deny me now?
ANTONIO:
Is't possible that my deserts to you
ANTONIO:
Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
ANTONIO:
Lest that it make me so unsound a man
ANTONIO:
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
ANTONIO:
That I have done for you.
VIOLA:
I know of none,
VIOLA:
Nor know I you by voice or any feature
VIOLA:
I hate ingratitude more in a man
VIOLA:
Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
VIOLA:
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
VIOLA:
Inhabits our frail blood.
ANTONIO:
O heavens themselves!
Second Officer:
Come, sir, I pray you, go.
ANTONIO:
Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
ANTONIO:
I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
ANTONIO:
Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
ANTONIO:
And to his image, which methought did promise
ANTONIO:
Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
First Officer:
What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
ANTONIO:
But O how vile an idol proves this god
ANTONIO:
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
ANTONIO:
In nature there's no blemish but the mind,
ANTONIO:
None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind
ANTONIO:
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
ANTONIO:
Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
First Officer:
The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.
ANTONIO:
Lead me on.
ANTONIO:
Exit with Officers
VIOLA:
Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
VIOLA:
That he believes himself: so do not I.
VIOLA:
Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
VIOLA:
That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Come hither, knight, come hither, Fabian: we'll
SIR TOBY BELCH:
whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
VIOLA:
He named Sebastian: I my brother know
VIOLA:
Yet living in my glass, even such and so
VIOLA:
In favour was my brother, and he went
VIOLA:
Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
VIOLA:
For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
VIOLA:
Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
VIOLA:
Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH:
A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than
SIR TOBY BELCH:
a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his
SIR TOBY BELCH:
friend here in necessity and denying him, and for
SIR TOBY BELCH:
his cowardship, ask Fabian.
FABIAN:
A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
SIR ANDREW:
'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
SIR ANDREW:
An I do not,--
FABIAN:
Come, let's see the event.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Exeunt
SIR TOBY BELCH:
ACT IV
SIR TOBY BELCH:
SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown
Clown:
Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
SEBASTIAN:
Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow
SEBASTIAN:
Let me be clear of thee.
Clown:
Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you, nor
Clown:
I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come
Clown:
speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario,
Clown:
nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
SEBASTIAN:
I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou
SEBASTIAN:
know'st not me.
Clown:
Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some
Clown:
great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my
Clown:
folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,
Clown:
will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy
Clown:
strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
Clown:
lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
SEBASTIAN:
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's
SEBASTIAN:
money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give
SEBASTIAN:
worse payment.
Clown:
By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men
Clown:
that give fools money get themselves a good
Clown:
report--after fourteen years' purchase.
Clown:
Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN
SIR ANDREW:
Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.
SEBASTIAN:
Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all
SEBASTIAN:
the people mad?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.
Clown:
This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be
Clown:
in some of your coats for two pence.
Clown:
Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Come on, sir, hold.
SIR ANDREW:
Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work
SIR ANDREW:
with him, I'll have an action of battery against
SIR ANDREW:
him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I
SIR ANDREW:
struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.
SEBASTIAN:
Let go thy hand.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young
SIR TOBY BELCH:
soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed, come on.
SEBASTIAN:
I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If
SEBASTIAN:
thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two
SIR TOBY BELCH:
of this malapert blood from you.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Enter OLIVIA
OLIVIA:
Hold, Toby, on thy life I charge thee, hold!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Madam!
OLIVIA:
Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
OLIVIA:
Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
OLIVIA:
Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!
OLIVIA:
Be not offended, dear Cesario.
OLIVIA:
Rudesby, be gone!
OLIVIA:
Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
OLIVIA:
I prithee, gentle friend,
OLIVIA:
Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
OLIVIA:
In this uncivil and thou unjust extent
OLIVIA:
Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
OLIVIA:
And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
OLIVIA:
This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby
OLIVIA:
Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go
OLIVIA:
Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
OLIVIA:
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
SEBASTIAN:
What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
SEBASTIAN:
Or I am mad, or else this is a dream
SEBASTIAN:
Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep,
SEBASTIAN:
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
OLIVIA:
Nay, come, I prithee, would thou'ldst be ruled by me!
SEBASTIAN:
Madam, I will.
OLIVIA:
O, say so, and so be!
OLIVIA:
Exeunt
OLIVIA:
SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.
OLIVIA:
Enter MARIA and Clown
MARIA:
Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard,
MARIA:
make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do
MARIA:
it quickly, I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.
MARIA:
Exit
Clown:
Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself
Clown:
in't, and I would I were the first that ever
Clown:
dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to
Clown:
become the function well, nor lean enough to be
Clown:
thought a good student, but to be said an honest man
Clown:
and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a
Clown:
careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.
Clown:
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Jove bless thee, master Parson.
Clown:
Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of
Clown:
Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily
Clown:
said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is,'
Clown:
so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson, for,
Clown:
what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
To him, Sir Topas.
Clown:
What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
The knave counterfeits well, a good knave.
MALVOLIO:
[Within]  Who calls there?
Clown:
Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio
Clown:
the lunatic.
MALVOLIO:
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.
Clown:
Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!
Clown:
talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Well said, Master Parson.
MALVOLIO:
Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir
MALVOLIO:
Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me
MALVOLIO:
here in hideous darkness.
Clown:
Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most
Clown:
modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones
Clown:
that will use the devil himself with courtesy
Clown:
sayest thou that house is dark?
MALVOLIO:
As hell, Sir Topas.
Clown:
Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,
Clown:
and the clearstores toward the south north are as
Clown:
lustrous as ebony, and yet complainest thou of
Clown:
obstruction?
MALVOLIO:
I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.
Clown:
Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness
Clown:
but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than
Clown:
the Egyptians in their fog.
MALVOLIO:
I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though
MALVOLIO:
ignorance were as dark as hell, and I say, there
MALVOLIO:
was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you
MALVOLIO:
are: make the trial of it in any constant question.
Clown:
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?
MALVOLIO:
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
Clown:
What thinkest thou of his opinion?
MALVOLIO:
I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
Clown:
Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness
Clown:
thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
Clown:
allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest
Clown:
thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
MALVOLIO:
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
SIR TOBY BELCH:
My most exquisite Sir Topas!
Clown:
Nay, I am for all waters.
MARIA:
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
MARIA:
gown: he sees thee not.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how
SIR TOBY BELCH:
thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this
SIR TOBY BELCH:
knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I
SIR TOBY BELCH:
would he were, for I am now so far in offence with
SIR TOBY BELCH:
my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this
SIR TOBY BELCH:
sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
Clown:
[Singing]
Clown:
'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
Clown:
Tell me how thy lady does.'
MALVOLIO:
Fool!
Clown:
'My lady is unkind, perdy.'
MALVOLIO:
Fool!
Clown:
'Alas, why is she so?'
MALVOLIO:
Fool, I say!
Clown:
'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?
MALVOLIO:
Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my
MALVOLIO:
hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper
MALVOLIO:
as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to
MALVOLIO:
thee for't.
Clown:
Master Malvolio?
MALVOLIO:
Ay, good fool.
Clown:
Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
MALVOLIO:
Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I
MALVOLIO:
am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
Clown:
But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no
Clown:
better in your wits than a fool.
MALVOLIO:
They have here propertied me, keep me in darkness,
MALVOLIO:
send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to
MALVOLIO:
face me out of my wits.
Clown:
Advise you what you say, the minister is here.
Clown:
Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!
Clown:
endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain
Clown:
bibble babble.
MALVOLIO:
Sir Topas!
Clown:
Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,
Clown:
sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.
Clown:
Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.
MALVOLIO:
Fool, fool, fool, I say!
Clown:
Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am
Clown:
shent for speaking to you.
MALVOLIO:
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I
MALVOLIO:
tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
Clown:
Well-a-day that you were, sir
MALVOLIO:
By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and
MALVOLIO:
light, and convey what I will set down to my lady
MALVOLIO:
it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
MALVOLIO:
of letter did.
Clown:
I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you
Clown:
not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?
MALVOLIO:
Believe me, I am not, I tell thee true.
Clown:
Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his
Clown:
brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.
MALVOLIO:
Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I
MALVOLIO:
prithee, be gone.
Clown:
[Singing]
Clown:
I am gone, sir,
Clown:
And anon, sir,
Clown:
I'll be with you again,
Clown:
In a trice,
Clown:
Like to the old Vice,
Clown:
Your need to sustain,
Clown:
Who, with dagger of lath,
Clown:
In his rage and his wrath,
Clown:
Cries, ah, ha! to the devil
Clown:
Like a mad lad,
Clown:
Pare thy nails, dad,
Clown:
Adieu, good man devil.
Clown:
Exit
Clown:
SCENE III. OLIVIA's garden.
Clown:
Enter SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN:
This is the air, that is the glorious sun,
SEBASTIAN:
This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't,
SEBASTIAN:
And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
SEBASTIAN:
Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?
SEBASTIAN:
I could not find him at the Elephant
SEBASTIAN:
Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,
SEBASTIAN:
That he did range the town to seek me out.
SEBASTIAN:
His counsel now might do me golden service,
SEBASTIAN:
For though my soul disputes well with my sense,
SEBASTIAN:
That this may be some error, but no madness,
SEBASTIAN:
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
SEBASTIAN:
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
SEBASTIAN:
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
SEBASTIAN:
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
SEBASTIAN:
To any other trust but that I am mad
SEBASTIAN:
Or else the lady's mad, yet, if 'twere so,
SEBASTIAN:
She could not sway her house, command her followers,
SEBASTIAN:
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
SEBASTIAN:
With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing
SEBASTIAN:
As I perceive she does: there's something in't
SEBASTIAN:
That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.
SEBASTIAN:
Enter OLIVIA and Priest
OLIVIA:
Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
OLIVIA:
Now go with me and with this holy man
OLIVIA:
Into the chantry by: there, before him,
OLIVIA:
And underneath that consecrated roof,
OLIVIA:
Plight me the full assurance of your faith,
OLIVIA:
That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
OLIVIA:
May live at peace. He shall conceal it
OLIVIA:
Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
OLIVIA:
What time we will our celebration keep
OLIVIA:
According to my birth. What do you say?
SEBASTIAN:
I'll follow this good man, and go with you,
SEBASTIAN:
And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
OLIVIA:
Then lead the way, good father, and heavens so shine,
OLIVIA:
That they may fairly note this act of mine!
OLIVIA:
Exeunt
OLIVIA:
ACT V
OLIVIA:
SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.
OLIVIA:
Enter Clown and FABIAN
FABIAN:
Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
Clown:
Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
FABIAN:
Any thing.
Clown:
Do not desire to see this letter.
FABIAN:
This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my
FABIAN:
dog again.
FABIAN:
Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords
DUKE ORSINO:
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
Clown:
Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.
DUKE ORSINO:
I know thee well, how dost thou, my good fellow?
Clown:
Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
Clown:
for my friends.
DUKE ORSINO:
Just the contrary, the better for thy friends.
Clown:
No, sir, the worse.
DUKE ORSINO:
How can that be?
Clown:
Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me,
Clown:
now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
Clown:
my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,
Clown:
and by my friends, I am abused: so that,
Clown:
conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives
Clown:
make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for
Clown:
my friends and the better for my foes.
DUKE ORSINO:
Why, this is excellent.
Clown:
By my troth, sir, no, though it please you to be
Clown:
one of my friends.
DUKE ORSINO:
Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
Clown:
But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would
Clown:
you could make it another.
DUKE ORSINO:
O, you give me ill counsel.
Clown:
Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,
Clown:
and let your flesh and blood obey it.
DUKE ORSINO:
Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
DUKE ORSINO:
double-dealer: there's another.
Clown:
Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play, and the old
Clown:
saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,
Clown:
sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of
Clown:
Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind, one, two, three.
DUKE ORSINO:
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw
DUKE ORSINO:
if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
DUKE ORSINO:
with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake
DUKE ORSINO:
my bounty further.
Clown:
Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
Clown:
again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think
Clown:
that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness
Clown:
but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I
Clown:
will awake it anon.
Clown:
Exit
VIOLA:
Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
VIOLA:
Enter ANTONIO and Officers
DUKE ORSINO:
That face of his I do remember well,
DUKE ORSINO:
Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
DUKE ORSINO:
As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war
DUKE ORSINO:
A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
DUKE ORSINO:
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,
DUKE ORSINO:
With which such scathful grapple did he make
DUKE ORSINO:
With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
DUKE ORSINO:
That very envy and the tongue of loss
DUKE ORSINO:
Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
First Officer:
Orsino, this is that Antonio
First Officer:
That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,
First Officer:
And this is he that did the Tiger board,
First Officer:
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg
First Officer:
Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
First Officer:
In private brabble did we apprehend him.
VIOLA:
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,
VIOLA:
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me
VIOLA:
I know not what 'twas but distraction.
DUKE ORSINO:
Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
DUKE ORSINO:
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
DUKE ORSINO:
Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
DUKE ORSINO:
Hast made thine enemies?
ANTONIO:
Orsino, noble sir,
ANTONIO:
Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me
ANTONIO:
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
ANTONIO:
Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
ANTONIO:
Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither
ANTONIO:
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
ANTONIO:
From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
ANTONIO:
Did I redeem, a wreck past hope he was
ANTONIO:
His life I gave him and did thereto add
ANTONIO:
My love, without retention or restraint,
ANTONIO:
All his in dedication, for his sake
ANTONIO:
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
ANTONIO:
Into the danger of this adverse town,
ANTONIO:
Drew to defend him when he was beset
ANTONIO:
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
ANTONIO:
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
ANTONIO:
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
ANTONIO:
And grew a twenty years removed thing
ANTONIO:
While one would wink, denied me mine own purse,
ANTONIO:
Which I had recommended to his use
ANTONIO:
Not half an hour before.
VIOLA:
How can this be?
DUKE ORSINO:
When came he to this town?
ANTONIO:
To-day, my lord, and for three months before,
ANTONIO:
No interim, not a minute's vacancy,
ANTONIO:
Both day and night did we keep company.
ANTONIO:
Enter OLIVIA and Attendants
DUKE ORSINO:
Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
DUKE ORSINO:
But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness
DUKE ORSINO:
Three months this youth hath tended upon me,
DUKE ORSINO:
But more of that anon. Take him aside.
OLIVIA:
What would my lord, but that he may not have,
OLIVIA:
Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
OLIVIA:
Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
VIOLA:
Madam!
DUKE ORSINO:
Gracious Olivia,--
OLIVIA:
What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--
VIOLA:
My lord would speak, my duty hushes me.
OLIVIA:
If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
OLIVIA:
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
OLIVIA:
As howling after music.
DUKE ORSINO:
Still so cruel?
OLIVIA:
Still so constant, lord.
DUKE ORSINO:
What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
DUKE ORSINO:
To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
DUKE ORSINO:
My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
DUKE ORSINO:
That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
OLIVIA:
Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
DUKE ORSINO:
Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
DUKE ORSINO:
Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
DUKE ORSINO:
Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
DUKE ORSINO:
That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this
DUKE ORSINO:
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
DUKE ORSINO:
And that I partly know the instrument
DUKE ORSINO:
That screws me from my true place in your favour,
DUKE ORSINO:
Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still,
DUKE ORSINO:
But this your minion, whom I know you love,
DUKE ORSINO:
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
DUKE ORSINO:
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
DUKE ORSINO:
Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
DUKE ORSINO:
Come, boy, with me, my thoughts are ripe in mischief
DUKE ORSINO:
I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
DUKE ORSINO:
To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
VIOLA:
And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
VIOLA:
To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
OLIVIA:
Where goes Cesario?
VIOLA:
After him I love
VIOLA:
More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
VIOLA:
More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
VIOLA:
If I do feign, you witnesses above
VIOLA:
Punish my life for tainting of my love!
OLIVIA:
Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
VIOLA:
Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
OLIVIA:
Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
OLIVIA:
Call forth the holy father.
DUKE ORSINO:
Come, away!
OLIVIA:
Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
DUKE ORSINO:
Husband!
OLIVIA:
Ay, husband: can he that deny?
DUKE ORSINO:
Her husband, sirrah!
VIOLA:
No, my lord, not I.
OLIVIA:
Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
OLIVIA:
That makes thee strangle thy propriety
OLIVIA:
Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up,
OLIVIA:
Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
OLIVIA:
As great as that thou fear'st.
OLIVIA:
Enter Priest
OLIVIA:
O, welcome, father!
OLIVIA:
Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
OLIVIA:
Here to unfold, though lately we intended
OLIVIA:
To keep in darkness what occasion now
OLIVIA:
Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
OLIVIA:
Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
Priest:
A contract of eternal bond of love,
Priest:
Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
Priest:
Attested by the holy close of lips,
Priest:
Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings,
Priest:
And all the ceremony of this compact
Priest:
Seal'd in my function, by my testimony
Priest:
Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
Priest:
I have travell'd but two hours.
DUKE ORSINO:
O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
DUKE ORSINO:
When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
DUKE ORSINO:
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
DUKE ORSINO:
That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
DUKE ORSINO:
Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feet
DUKE ORSINO:
Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
VIOLA:
My lord, I do protest--
OLIVIA:
O, do not swear!
OLIVIA:
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
OLIVIA:
Enter SIR ANDREW
SIR ANDREW:
For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
SIR ANDREW:
to Sir Toby.
OLIVIA:
What's the matter?
SIR ANDREW:
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
SIR ANDREW:
a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
SIR ANDREW:
help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
OLIVIA:
Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
SIR ANDREW:
The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
SIR ANDREW:
a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
DUKE ORSINO:
My gentleman, Cesario?
SIR ANDREW:
'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
SIR ANDREW:
nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do't
SIR ANDREW:
by Sir Toby.
VIOLA:
Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you
VIOLA:
You drew your sword upon me without cause,
VIOLA:
But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.
SIR ANDREW:
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
SIR ANDREW:
think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
SIR ANDREW:
Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown
SIR ANDREW:
Here comes Sir Toby halting, you shall hear more
SIR ANDREW:
but if he had not been in drink, he would have
SIR ANDREW:
tickled you othergates than he did.
DUKE ORSINO:
How now, gentleman! how is't with you?
SIR TOBY BELCH:
That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
SIR TOBY BELCH:
on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
Clown:
O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone, his eyes
Clown:
were set at eight i' the morning.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
SIR TOBY BELCH:
hate a drunken rogue.
OLIVIA:
Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
SIR ANDREW:
I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.
SIR TOBY BELCH:
Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
SIR TOBY BELCH:
knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
OLIVIA:
Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
OLIVIA:
Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
OLIVIA:
Enter SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN:
I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman
SEBASTIAN:
But, had it been the brother of my blood,
SEBASTIAN:
I must have done no less with wit and safety.
SEBASTIAN:
You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
SEBASTIAN:
I do perceive it hath offended you
SEBASTIAN:
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
SEBASTIAN:
We made each other but so late ago.
DUKE ORSINO:
One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
DUKE ORSINO:
A natural perspective, that is and is not!
SEBASTIAN:
Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
SEBASTIAN:
How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
SEBASTIAN:
Since I have lost thee!
ANTONIO:
Sebastian are you?
SEBASTIAN:
Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
ANTONIO:
How have you made division of yourself?
ANTONIO:
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
ANTONIO:
Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
OLIVIA:
Most wonderful!
SEBASTIAN:
Do I stand there? I never had a brother,
SEBASTIAN:
Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
SEBASTIAN:
Of here and every where. I had a sister,
SEBASTIAN:
Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
SEBASTIAN:
Of charity, what kin are you to me?
SEBASTIAN:
What countryman? what name? what parentage?
VIOLA:
Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father,
VIOLA:
Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
VIOLA:
So went he suited to his watery tomb
VIOLA:
If spirits can assume both form and suit
VIOLA:
You come to fright us.
SEBASTIAN:
A spirit I am indeed,
SEBASTIAN:
But am in that dimension grossly clad
SEBASTIAN:
Which from the womb I did participate.
SEBASTIAN:
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
SEBASTIAN:
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
SEBASTIAN:
And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'
VIOLA:
My father had a mole upon his brow.
SEBASTIAN:
And so had mine.
VIOLA:
And died that day when Viola from her birth
VIOLA:
Had number'd thirteen years.
SEBASTIAN:
O, that record is lively in my soul!
SEBASTIAN:
He finished indeed his mortal act
SEBASTIAN:
That day that made my sister thirteen years.
VIOLA:
If nothing lets to make us happy both
VIOLA:
But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
VIOLA:
Do not embrace me till each circumstance
VIOLA:
Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
VIOLA:
That I am Viola: which to confirm,
VIOLA:
I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
VIOLA:
Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help
VIOLA:
I was preserved to serve this noble count.
VIOLA:
All the occurrence of my fortune since
VIOLA:
Hath been between this lady and this lord.
SEBASTIAN:
[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook
SEBASTIAN:
But nature to her bias drew in that.
SEBASTIAN:
You would have been contracted to a maid,
SEBASTIAN:
Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
SEBASTIAN:
You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
DUKE ORSINO:
Be not amazed, right noble is his blood.
DUKE ORSINO:
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
DUKE ORSINO:
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
DUKE ORSINO:
To VIOLA
DUKE ORSINO:
Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
DUKE ORSINO:
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
VIOLA:
And all those sayings will I overswear,
VIOLA:
And those swearings keep as true in soul
VIOLA:
As doth that orbed continent the fire
VIOLA:
That severs day from night.
DUKE ORSINO:
Give me thy hand,
DUKE ORSINO:
And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
VIOLA:
The captain that did bring me first on shore
VIOLA:
Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
VIOLA:
Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
VIOLA:
A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
OLIVIA:
He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither
OLIVIA:
And yet, alas, now I remember me,
OLIVIA:
They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
OLIVIA:
Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN
OLIVIA:
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
OLIVIA:
From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
OLIVIA:
How does he, sirrah?
Clown:
Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
Clown:
well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
Clown:
letter to you, I should have given't you to-day
Clown:
morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
Clown:
so it skills not much when they are delivered.
OLIVIA:
Open't, and read it.
Clown:
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
Clown:
the madman.
Clown:
Reads
Clown:
'By the Lord, madam,'--
OLIVIA:
How now! art thou mad?
Clown:
No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
Clown:
will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
OLIVIA:
Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
Clown:
So I do, madonna, but to read his right wits is to
Clown:
read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
OLIVIA:
Read it you, sirrah.
OLIVIA:
To FABIAN
FABIAN:
[Reads]  'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
FABIAN:
world shall know it: though you have put me into
FABIAN:
darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
FABIAN:
me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
FABIAN:
your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
FABIAN:
me to the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt
FABIAN:
not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
FABIAN:
Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
FABIAN:
unthought of and speak out of my injury.
FABIAN:
THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
OLIVIA:
Did he write this?
Clown:
Ay, madam.
DUKE ORSINO:
This savours not much of distraction.
OLIVIA:
See him deliver'd, Fabian, bring him hither.
OLIVIA:
Exit FABIAN
OLIVIA:
My lord so please you, these things further
OLIVIA:
thought on,
OLIVIA:
To think me as well a sister as a wife,
OLIVIA:
One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
OLIVIA:
Here at my house and at my proper cost.
DUKE ORSINO:
Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
DUKE ORSINO:
To VIOLA
DUKE ORSINO:
Your master quits you, and for your service done him,
DUKE ORSINO:
So much against the mettle of your sex,
DUKE ORSINO:
So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
DUKE ORSINO:
And since you call'd me master for so long,
DUKE ORSINO:
Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
DUKE ORSINO:
Your master's mistress.
OLIVIA:
A sister! you are she.
OLIVIA:
Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO
DUKE ORSINO:
Is this the madman?
OLIVIA:
Ay, my lord, this same.
OLIVIA:
How now, Malvolio!
MALVOLIO:
Madam, you have done me wrong,
MALVOLIO:
Notorious wrong.
OLIVIA:
Have I, Malvolio? no.
MALVOLIO:
Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
MALVOLIO:
You must not now deny it is your hand
MALVOLIO:
Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase,
MALVOLIO:
Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention
MALVOLIO:
You can say none of this: well, grant it then
MALVOLIO:
And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
MALVOLIO:
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
MALVOLIO:
Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
MALVOLIO:
To put on yellow stockings and to frown
MALVOLIO:
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people,
MALVOLIO:
And, acting this in an obedient hope,
MALVOLIO:
Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
MALVOLIO:
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
MALVOLIO:
And made the most notorious geck and gull
MALVOLIO:
That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
OLIVIA:
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
OLIVIA:
Though, I confess, much like the character
OLIVIA:
But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
OLIVIA:
And now I do bethink me, it was she
OLIVIA:
First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling,
OLIVIA:
And in such forms which here were presupposed
OLIVIA:
Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content
OLIVIA:
This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee,
OLIVIA:
But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
OLIVIA:
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
OLIVIA:
Of thine own cause.
FABIAN:
Good madam, hear me speak,
FABIAN:
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
FABIAN:
Taint the condition of this present hour,
FABIAN:
Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
FABIAN:
Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
FABIAN:
Set this device against Malvolio here,
FABIAN:
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
FABIAN:
We had conceived against him: Maria writ
FABIAN:
The letter at Sir Toby's great importance,
FABIAN:
In recompense whereof he hath married her.
FABIAN:
How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
FABIAN:
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,
FABIAN:
If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
FABIAN:
That have on both sides pass'd.
OLIVIA:
Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
Clown:
Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
Clown:
and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
Clown:
one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but
Clown:
that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
Clown:
But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
Clown:
a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
Clown:
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
MALVOLIO:
I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
MALVOLIO:
Exit
OLIVIA:
He hath been most notoriously abused.
DUKE ORSINO:
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace
DUKE ORSINO:
He hath not told us of the captain yet
DUKE ORSINO:
When that is known and golden time convents,
DUKE ORSINO:
A solemn combination shall be made
DUKE ORSINO:
Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
DUKE ORSINO:
We will not part from hence. Cesario, come,
DUKE ORSINO:
For so you shall be, while you are a man,
DUKE ORSINO:
But when in other habits you are seen,
DUKE ORSINO:
Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
DUKE ORSINO:
Exeunt all, except Clown
Clown:
[Sings]
Clown:
When that I was and a little tiny boy,
Clown:
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
Clown:
A foolish thing was but a toy,
Clown:
For the rain it raineth every day.
Clown:
But when I came to man's estate,
Clown:
With hey, ho,  and c.
Clown:
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
Clown:
For the rain,  and c.
Clown:
But when I came, alas! to wive,
Clown:
With hey, ho,  and c.
Clown:
By swaggering could I never thrive,
Clown:
For the rain,  and c.
Clown:
But when I came unto my beds,
Clown:
With hey, ho,  and c.
Clown:
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
Clown:
For the rain,  and c.
Clown:
A great while ago the world begun,
Clown:
With hey, ho,  and c.
Clown:
But that's all one, our play is done,
Clown:
And we'll strive to please you every day.
Clown:
Exit
