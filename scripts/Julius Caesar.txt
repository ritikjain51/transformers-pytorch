BASTARD:
ACT I
BASTARD:
SCENE I. Rome. A street.
BASTARD:
Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners
FLAVIUS:
Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home
FLAVIUS:
Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
FLAVIUS:
Being mechanical, you ought not walk
FLAVIUS:
Upon a labouring day without the sign
FLAVIUS:
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
First Commoner:
Why, sir, a carpenter.
MARULLUS:
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
MARULLUS:
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
MARULLUS:
You, sir, what trade are you?
Second Commoner:
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
Second Commoner:
as you would say, a cobbler.
MARULLUS:
But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
Second Commoner:
A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
Second Commoner:
conscience, which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
MARULLUS:
What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?
Second Commoner:
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
Second Commoner:
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
MARULLUS:
What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!
Second Commoner:
Why, sir, cobble you.
FLAVIUS:
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
Second Commoner:
Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
Second Commoner:
meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
Second Commoner:
matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
Second Commoner:
to old shoes, when they are in great danger, I
Second Commoner:
recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
Second Commoner:
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
FLAVIUS:
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
FLAVIUS:
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
Second Commoner:
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
Second Commoner:
into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
Second Commoner:
to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
MARULLUS:
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
MARULLUS:
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
MARULLUS:
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
MARULLUS:
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
MARULLUS:
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
MARULLUS:
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
MARULLUS:
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
MARULLUS:
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
MARULLUS:
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
MARULLUS:
The livelong day, with patient expectation,
MARULLUS:
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
MARULLUS:
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
MARULLUS:
Have you not made an universal shout,
MARULLUS:
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
MARULLUS:
To hear the replication of your sounds
MARULLUS:
Made in her concave shores?
MARULLUS:
And do you now put on your best attire?
MARULLUS:
And do you now cull out a holiday?
MARULLUS:
And do you now strew flowers in his way
MARULLUS:
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
MARULLUS:
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
MARULLUS:
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
MARULLUS:
That needs must light on this ingratitude.
FLAVIUS:
Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
FLAVIUS:
Assemble all the poor men of your sort,
FLAVIUS:
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
FLAVIUS:
Into the channel, till the lowest stream
FLAVIUS:
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
FLAVIUS:
Exeunt all the Commoners
FLAVIUS:
See whether their basest metal be not moved,
FLAVIUS:
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
FLAVIUS:
Go you down that way towards the Capitol,
FLAVIUS:
This way will I disrobe the images,
FLAVIUS:
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
MARULLUS:
May we do so?
MARULLUS:
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
FLAVIUS:
It is no matter, let no images
FLAVIUS:
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
FLAVIUS:
And drive away the vulgar from the streets
FLAVIUS:
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
FLAVIUS:
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
FLAVIUS:
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
FLAVIUS:
Who else would soar above the view of men
FLAVIUS:
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
FLAVIUS:
Exeunt
FLAVIUS:
SCENE II. A public place.
FLAVIUS:
Flourish. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, for the course,  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA, a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer
CAESAR:
Calpurnia!
CASCA:
Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
CAESAR:
Calpurnia!
CALPURNIA:
Here, my lord.
CAESAR:
Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
CAESAR:
When he doth run his course. Antonius!
ANTONY:
Caesar, my lord?
CAESAR:
Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
CAESAR:
To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say,
CAESAR:
The barren, touched in this holy chase,
CAESAR:
Shake off their sterile curse.
ANTONY:
I shall remember
ANTONY:
When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.
CAESAR:
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.
CAESAR:
Flourish
Soothsayer:
Caesar!
CAESAR:
Ha! who calls?
CASCA:
Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
CAESAR:
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
CAESAR:
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
CAESAR:
Cry 'Caesar!' Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.
Soothsayer:
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR:
What man is that?
BRUTUS:
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
CAESAR:
Set him before me, let me see his face.
CASSIUS:
Fellow, come from the throng, look upon Caesar.
CAESAR:
What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
Soothsayer:
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR:
He is a dreamer, let us leave him: pass.
CAESAR:
Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS
CASSIUS:
Will you go see the order of the course?
BRUTUS:
Not I.
CASSIUS:
I pray you, do.
BRUTUS:
I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
BRUTUS:
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
BRUTUS:
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires,
BRUTUS:
I'll leave you.
CASSIUS:
Brutus, I do observe you now of late
CASSIUS:
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
CASSIUS:
And show of love as I was wont to have
CASSIUS:
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
CASSIUS:
Over your friend that loves you.
BRUTUS:
Cassius,
BRUTUS:
Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
BRUTUS:
I turn the trouble of my countenance
BRUTUS:
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
BRUTUS:
Of late with passions of some difference,
BRUTUS:
Conceptions only proper to myself,
BRUTUS:
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors,
BRUTUS:
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
BRUTUS:
Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
BRUTUS:
Nor construe any further my neglect,
BRUTUS:
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
BRUTUS:
Forgets the shows of love to other men.
CASSIUS:
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
CASSIUS:
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
CASSIUS:
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
CASSIUS:
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
BRUTUS:
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself,
BRUTUS:
But by reflection, by some other things.
CASSIUS:
'Tis just
CASSIUS:
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
CASSIUS:
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
CASSIUS:
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
CASSIUS:
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
CASSIUS:
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
CASSIUS:
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
CASSIUS:
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
CASSIUS:
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
BRUTUS:
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
BRUTUS:
That you would have me seek into myself
BRUTUS:
For that which is not in me?
CASSIUS:
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear
CASSIUS:
And since you know you cannot see yourself
CASSIUS:
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
CASSIUS:
Will modestly discover to yourself
CASSIUS:
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
CASSIUS:
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus
CASSIUS:
Were I a common laugher, or did use
CASSIUS:
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
CASSIUS:
To every new protester, if you know
CASSIUS:
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
CASSIUS:
And after scandal them, or if you know
CASSIUS:
That I profess myself in banqueting
CASSIUS:
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
CASSIUS:
Flourish, and shout
BRUTUS:
What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
BRUTUS:
Choose Caesar for their king.
CASSIUS:
Ay, do you fear it?
CASSIUS:
Then must I think you would not have it so.
BRUTUS:
I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
BRUTUS:
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
BRUTUS:
What is it that you would impart to me?
BRUTUS:
If it be aught toward the general good,
BRUTUS:
Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
BRUTUS:
And I will look on both indifferently,
BRUTUS:
For let the gods so speed me as I love
BRUTUS:
The name of honour more than I fear death.
CASSIUS:
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
CASSIUS:
As well as I do know your outward favour.
CASSIUS:
Well, honour is the subject of my story.
CASSIUS:
I cannot tell what you and other men
CASSIUS:
Think of this life, but, for my single self,
CASSIUS:
I had as lief not be as live to be
CASSIUS:
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
CASSIUS:
I was born free as Caesar, so were you
CASSIUS:
We both have fed as well, and we can both
CASSIUS:
Endure the winter's cold as well as he
CASSIUS:
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
CASSIUS:
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
CASSIUS:
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
CASSIUS:
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
CASSIUS:
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
CASSIUS:
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
CASSIUS:
And bade him follow, so indeed he did.
CASSIUS:
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
CASSIUS:
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
CASSIUS:
And stemming it with hearts of controversy,
CASSIUS:
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
CASSIUS:
Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
CASSIUS:
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
CASSIUS:
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
CASSIUS:
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
CASSIUS:
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
CASSIUS:
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
CASSIUS:
A wretched creature and must bend his body,
CASSIUS:
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
CASSIUS:
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
CASSIUS:
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
CASSIUS:
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake,
CASSIUS:
His coward lips did from their colour fly,
CASSIUS:
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
CASSIUS:
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan
CASSIUS:
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
CASSIUS:
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
CASSIUS:
Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
CASSIUS:
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
CASSIUS:
A man of such a feeble temper should
CASSIUS:
So get the start of the majestic world
CASSIUS:
And bear the palm alone.
CASSIUS:
Shout. Flourish
BRUTUS:
Another general shout!
BRUTUS:
I do believe that these applauses are
BRUTUS:
For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
CASSIUS:
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
CASSIUS:
Like a Colossus, and we petty men
CASSIUS:
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
CASSIUS:
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
CASSIUS:
Men at some time are masters of their fates
CASSIUS:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
CASSIUS:
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
CASSIUS:
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
CASSIUS:
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
CASSIUS:
Write them together, yours is as fair a name,
CASSIUS:
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well,
CASSIUS:
Weigh them, it is as heavy, conjure with 'em,
CASSIUS:
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
CASSIUS:
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
CASSIUS:
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
CASSIUS:
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
CASSIUS:
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
CASSIUS:
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
CASSIUS:
But it was famed with more than with one man?
CASSIUS:
When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
CASSIUS:
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
CASSIUS:
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
CASSIUS:
When there is in it but one only man.
CASSIUS:
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
CASSIUS:
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
CASSIUS:
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
CASSIUS:
As easily as a king.
BRUTUS:
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous,
BRUTUS:
What you would work me to, I have some aim
BRUTUS:
How I have thought of this and of these times,
BRUTUS:
I shall recount hereafter, for this present,
BRUTUS:
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
BRUTUS:
Be any further moved. What you have said
BRUTUS:
I will consider, what you have to say
BRUTUS:
I will with patience hear, and find a time
BRUTUS:
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
BRUTUS:
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this
BRUTUS:
Brutus had rather be a villager
BRUTUS:
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
BRUTUS:
Under these hard conditions as this time
BRUTUS:
Is like to lay upon us.
CASSIUS:
I am glad that my weak words
CASSIUS:
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
BRUTUS:
The games are done and Caesar is returning.
CASSIUS:
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
CASSIUS:
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
CASSIUS:
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
CASSIUS:
Re-enter CAESAR and his Train
BRUTUS:
I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
BRUTUS:
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
BRUTUS:
And all the rest look like a chidden train
BRUTUS:
Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero
BRUTUS:
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
BRUTUS:
As we have seen him in the Capitol,
BRUTUS:
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
CASSIUS:
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
CAESAR:
Antonius!
ANTONY:
Caesar?
CAESAR:
Let me have men about me that are fat,
CAESAR:
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights
CAESAR:
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look,
CAESAR:
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
ANTONY:
Fear him not, Caesar, he's not dangerous,
ANTONY:
He is a noble Roman and well given.
CAESAR:
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not
CAESAR:
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
CAESAR:
I do not know the man I should avoid
CAESAR:
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,
CAESAR:
He is a great observer and he looks
CAESAR:
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
CAESAR:
As thou dost, Antony, he hears no music,
CAESAR:
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
CAESAR:
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
CAESAR:
That could be moved to smile at any thing.
CAESAR:
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
CAESAR:
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
CAESAR:
And therefore are they very dangerous.
CAESAR:
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
CAESAR:
Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.
CAESAR:
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
CAESAR:
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
CAESAR:
Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA
CASCA:
You pull'd me by the cloak, would you speak with me?
BRUTUS:
Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced to-day,
BRUTUS:
That Caesar looks so sad.
CASCA:
Why, you were with him, were you not?
BRUTUS:
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
CASCA:
Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
CASCA:
offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
CASCA:
thus, and then the people fell a-shouting.
BRUTUS:
What was the second noise for?
CASCA:
Why, for that too.
CASSIUS:
They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
CASCA:
Why, for that too.
BRUTUS:
Was the crown offered him thrice?
CASCA:
Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
CASCA:
time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
CASCA:
mine honest neighbours shouted.
CASSIUS:
Who offered him the crown?
CASCA:
Why, Antony.
BRUTUS:
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
CASCA:
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it
CASCA:
it was mere foolery, I did not mark it. I saw Mark
CASCA:
Antony offer him a crown,--yet 'twas not a crown
CASCA:
neither, 'twas one of these coronets,--and, as I told
CASCA:
you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
CASCA:
thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
CASCA:
offered it to him again, then he put it by again
CASCA:
but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
CASCA:
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
CASCA:
time, he put it the third time by: and still as he
CASCA:
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
CASCA:
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
CASCA:
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
CASCA:
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
CASCA:
Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it: and
CASCA:
for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
CASCA:
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
CASSIUS:
But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
CASCA:
He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
CASCA:
mouth, and was speechless.
BRUTUS:
'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
CASSIUS:
No, Caesar hath it not, but you and I,
CASSIUS:
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
CASCA:
I know not what you mean by that, but, I am sure,
CASCA:
Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
CASCA:
clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
CASCA:
displeased them, as they use to do the players in
CASCA:
the theatre, I am no true man.
BRUTUS:
What said he when he came unto himself?
CASCA:
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
CASCA:
common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
CASCA:
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
CASCA:
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
CASCA:
occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
CASCA:
I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
CASCA:
he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
CASCA:
If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
CASCA:
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
CASCA:
or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
CASCA:
soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
CASCA:
there's no heed to be taken of them, if Caesar had
CASCA:
stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
BRUTUS:
And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
CASCA:
Ay.
CASSIUS:
Did Cicero say any thing?
CASCA:
Ay, he spoke Greek.
CASSIUS:
To what effect?
CASCA:
Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
CASCA:
face again: but those that understood him smiled at
CASCA:
one another and shook their heads, but, for mine own
CASCA:
part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
CASCA:
news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
CASCA:
off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
CASCA:
well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
CASCA:
remember it.
CASSIUS:
Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
CASCA:
No, I am promised forth.
CASSIUS:
Will you dine with me to-morrow?
CASCA:
Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
CASCA:
worth the eating.
CASSIUS:
Good: I will expect you.
CASCA:
Do so. Farewell, both.
CASCA:
Exit
BRUTUS:
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
BRUTUS:
He was quick mettle when he went to school.
CASSIUS:
So is he now in execution
CASSIUS:
Of any bold or noble enterprise,
CASSIUS:
However he puts on this tardy form.
CASSIUS:
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
CASSIUS:
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
CASSIUS:
With better appetite.
BRUTUS:
And so it is. For this time I will leave you
BRUTUS:
To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
BRUTUS:
I will come home to you, or, if you will,
BRUTUS:
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
CASSIUS:
I will do so: till then, think of the world.
CASSIUS:
Exit BRUTUS
CASSIUS:
Well, Brutus, thou art noble, yet, I see,
CASSIUS:
Thy honourable metal may be wrought
CASSIUS:
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
CASSIUS:
That noble minds keep ever with their likes,
CASSIUS:
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
CASSIUS:
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus
CASSIUS:
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
CASSIUS:
He should not humour me. I will this night,
CASSIUS:
In several hands, in at his windows throw,
CASSIUS:
As if they came from several citizens,
CASSIUS:
Writings all tending to the great opinion
CASSIUS:
That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely
CASSIUS:
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at
CASSIUS:
And after this let Caesar seat him sure,
CASSIUS:
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
CASSIUS:
Exit
CASSIUS:
SCENE III. The same. A street.
CASSIUS:
Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO
CICERO:
Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
CICERO:
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
CASCA:
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
CASCA:
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
CASCA:
I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
CASCA:
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
CASCA:
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
CASCA:
To be exalted with the threatening clouds
CASCA:
But never till to-night, never till now,
CASCA:
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
CASCA:
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
CASCA:
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
CASCA:
Incenses them to send destruction.
CICERO:
Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?
CASCA:
A common slave--you know him well by sight--
CASCA:
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
CASCA:
Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
CASCA:
Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
CASCA:
Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
CASCA:
Against the Capitol I met a lion,
CASCA:
Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
CASCA:
Without annoying me: and there were drawn
CASCA:
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
CASCA:
Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw
CASCA:
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
CASCA:
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
CASCA:
Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
CASCA:
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
CASCA:
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
CASCA:
'These are their reasons, they are natural,'
CASCA:
For, I believe, they are portentous things
CASCA:
Unto the climate that they point upon.
CICERO:
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time
CICERO:
But men may construe things after their fashion,
CICERO:
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
CICERO:
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
CASCA:
He doth, for he did bid Antonius
CASCA:
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
CICERO:
Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
CICERO:
Is not to walk in.
CASCA:
Farewell, Cicero.
CASCA:
Exit CICERO
CASCA:
Enter CASSIUS
CASSIUS:
Who's there?
CASCA:
A Roman.
CASSIUS:
Casca, by your voice.
CASCA:
Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
CASSIUS:
A very pleasing night to honest men.
CASCA:
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
CASSIUS:
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
CASSIUS:
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
CASSIUS:
Submitting me unto the perilous night,
CASSIUS:
And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
CASSIUS:
Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone,
CASSIUS:
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
CASSIUS:
The breast of heaven, I did present myself
CASSIUS:
Even in the aim and very flash of it.
CASCA:
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
CASCA:
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
CASCA:
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
CASCA:
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
CASSIUS:
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
CASSIUS:
That should be in a Roman you do want,
CASSIUS:
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
CASSIUS:
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
CASSIUS:
To see the strange impatience of the heavens
CASSIUS:
But if you would consider the true cause
CASSIUS:
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
CASSIUS:
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
CASSIUS:
Why old men fool and children calculate,
CASSIUS:
Why all these things change from their ordinance
CASSIUS:
Their natures and preformed faculties
CASSIUS:
To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
CASSIUS:
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
CASSIUS:
To make them instruments of fear and warning
CASSIUS:
Unto some monstrous state.
CASSIUS:
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
CASSIUS:
Most like this dreadful night,
CASSIUS:
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
CASSIUS:
As doth the lion in the Capitol,
CASSIUS:
A man no mightier than thyself or me
CASSIUS:
In personal action, yet prodigious grown
CASSIUS:
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
CASCA:
'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
CASSIUS:
Let it be who it is: for Romans now
CASSIUS:
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors,
CASSIUS:
But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
CASSIUS:
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits,
CASSIUS:
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
CASCA:
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
CASCA:
Mean to establish Caesar as a king,
CASCA:
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
CASCA:
In every place, save here in Italy.
CASSIUS:
I know where I will wear this dagger then,
CASSIUS:
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
CASSIUS:
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong,
CASSIUS:
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat
CASSIUS:
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
CASSIUS:
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
CASSIUS:
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit,
CASSIUS:
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
CASSIUS:
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
CASSIUS:
If I know this, know all the world besides,
CASSIUS:
That part of tyranny that I do bear
CASSIUS:
I can shake off at pleasure.
CASSIUS:
Thunder still
CASCA:
So can I
CASCA:
So every bondman in his own hand bears
CASCA:
The power to cancel his captivity.
CASSIUS:
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
CASSIUS:
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
CASSIUS:
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
CASSIUS:
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
CASSIUS:
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
CASSIUS:
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
CASSIUS:
What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
CASSIUS:
For the base matter to illuminate
CASSIUS:
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
CASSIUS:
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
CASSIUS:
Before a willing bondman, then I know
CASSIUS:
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
CASSIUS:
And dangers are to me indifferent.
CASCA:
You speak to Casca, and to such a man
CASCA:
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand
CASCA:
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
CASCA:
And I will set this foot of mine as far
CASCA:
As who goes farthest.
CASSIUS:
There's a bargain made.
CASSIUS:
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
CASSIUS:
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
CASSIUS:
To undergo with me an enterprise
CASSIUS:
Of honourable-dangerous consequence,
CASSIUS:
And I do know, by this, they stay for me
CASSIUS:
In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
CASSIUS:
There is no stir or walking in the streets,
CASSIUS:
And the complexion of the element
CASSIUS:
In favour's like the work we have in hand,
CASSIUS:
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
CASCA:
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
CASSIUS:
'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait,
CASSIUS:
He is a friend.
CASSIUS:
Enter CINNA
CASSIUS:
Cinna, where haste you so?
CINNA:
To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
CASSIUS:
No, it is Casca, one incorporate
CASSIUS:
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
CINNA:
I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
CINNA:
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
CASSIUS:
Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
CINNA:
Yes, you are.
CINNA:
O Cassius, if you could
CINNA:
But win the noble Brutus to our party--
CASSIUS:
Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
CASSIUS:
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
CASSIUS:
Where Brutus may but find it, and throw this
CASSIUS:
In at his window, set this up with wax
CASSIUS:
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
CASSIUS:
Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
CASSIUS:
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
CINNA:
All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
CINNA:
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
CINNA:
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
CASSIUS:
That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
CASSIUS:
Exit CINNA
CASSIUS:
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
CASSIUS:
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
CASSIUS:
Is ours already, and the man entire
CASSIUS:
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
CASCA:
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts
CASCA:
And that which would appear offence in us,
CASCA:
His countenance, like richest alchemy,
CASCA:
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
CASSIUS:
Him and his worth and our great need of him
CASSIUS:
You have right well conceited. Let us go,
CASSIUS:
For it is after midnight, and ere day
CASSIUS:
We will awake him and be sure of him.
CASSIUS:
Exeunt
CASSIUS:
ACT II
CASSIUS:
SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.
CASSIUS:
Enter BRUTUS
BRUTUS:
What, Lucius, ho!
BRUTUS:
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
BRUTUS:
Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
BRUTUS:
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
BRUTUS:
When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
BRUTUS:
Enter LUCIUS
LUCIUS:
Call'd you, my lord?
BRUTUS:
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius
BRUTUS:
When it is lighted, come and call me here.
LUCIUS:
I will, my lord.
LUCIUS:
Exit
BRUTUS:
It must be by his death: and for my part,
BRUTUS:
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
BRUTUS:
But for the general. He would be crown'd
BRUTUS:
How that might change his nature, there's the question.
BRUTUS:
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,
BRUTUS:
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that,--
BRUTUS:
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
BRUTUS:
That at his will he may do danger with.
BRUTUS:
The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
BRUTUS:
Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
BRUTUS:
I have not known when his affections sway'd
BRUTUS:
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
BRUTUS:
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
BRUTUS:
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face,
BRUTUS:
But when he once attains the upmost round.
BRUTUS:
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
BRUTUS:
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
BRUTUS:
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
BRUTUS:
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
BRUTUS:
Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
BRUTUS:
Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
BRUTUS:
Would run to these and these extremities
BRUTUS:
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
BRUTUS:
Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
BRUTUS:
And kill him in the shell.
BRUTUS:
Re-enter LUCIUS
LUCIUS:
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
LUCIUS:
Searching the window for a flint, I found
LUCIUS:
This paper, thus seal'd up, and, I am sure,
LUCIUS:
It did not lie there when I went to bed.
LUCIUS:
Gives him the letter
BRUTUS:
Get you to bed again, it is not day.
BRUTUS:
Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?
LUCIUS:
I know not, sir.
BRUTUS:
Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
LUCIUS:
I will, sir.
LUCIUS:
Exit
BRUTUS:
The exhalations whizzing in the air
BRUTUS:
Give so much light that I may read by them.
BRUTUS:
Opens the letter and reads
BRUTUS:
'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
BRUTUS:
Shall Rome,  and c. Speak, strike, redress!
BRUTUS:
Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
BRUTUS:
Such instigations have been often dropp'd
BRUTUS:
Where I have took them up.
BRUTUS:
'Shall Rome,  and c.' Thus must I piece it out
BRUTUS:
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
BRUTUS:
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
BRUTUS:
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
BRUTUS:
'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
BRUTUS:
To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise
BRUTUS:
If the redress will follow, thou receivest
BRUTUS:
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
BRUTUS:
Re-enter LUCIUS
LUCIUS:
Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
LUCIUS:
Knocking within
BRUTUS:
'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
BRUTUS:
Exit LUCIUS
BRUTUS:
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
BRUTUS:
I have not slept.
BRUTUS:
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
BRUTUS:
And the first motion, all the interim is
BRUTUS:
Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream
BRUTUS:
The Genius and the mortal instruments
BRUTUS:
Are then in council, and the state of man,
BRUTUS:
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
BRUTUS:
The nature of an insurrection.
BRUTUS:
Re-enter LUCIUS
LUCIUS:
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
LUCIUS:
Who doth desire to see you.
BRUTUS:
Is he alone?
LUCIUS:
No, sir, there are moe with him.
BRUTUS:
Do you know them?
LUCIUS:
No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
LUCIUS:
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
LUCIUS:
That by no means I may discover them
LUCIUS:
By any mark of favour.
BRUTUS:
Let 'em enter.
BRUTUS:
Exit LUCIUS
BRUTUS:
They are the faction. O conspiracy,
BRUTUS:
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
BRUTUS:
When evils are most free? O, then by day
BRUTUS:
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
BRUTUS:
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy,
BRUTUS:
Hide it in smiles and affability
BRUTUS:
For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
BRUTUS:
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
BRUTUS:
To hide thee from prevention.
BRUTUS:
Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS
CASSIUS:
I think we are too bold upon your rest
CASSIUS:
Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?
BRUTUS:
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
BRUTUS:
Know I these men that come along with you?
CASSIUS:
Yes, every man of them, and no man here
CASSIUS:
But honours you, and every one doth wish
CASSIUS:
You had but that opinion of yourself
CASSIUS:
Which every noble Roman bears of you.
CASSIUS:
This is Trebonius.
BRUTUS:
He is welcome hither.
CASSIUS:
This, Decius Brutus.
BRUTUS:
He is welcome too.
CASSIUS:
This, Casca, this, Cinna, and this, Metellus Cimber.
BRUTUS:
They are all welcome.
BRUTUS:
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
BRUTUS:
Betwixt your eyes and night?
CASSIUS:
Shall I entreat a word?
CASSIUS:
BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
CASCA:
No.
CINNA:
O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yon gray lines
CINNA:
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
CASCA:
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
CASCA:
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
CASCA:
Which is a great way growing on the south,
CASCA:
Weighing the youthful season of the year.
CASCA:
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
CASCA:
He first presents his fire, and the high east
CASCA:
Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
BRUTUS:
Give me your hands all over, one by one.
CASSIUS:
And let us swear our resolution.
BRUTUS:
No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
BRUTUS:
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
BRUTUS:
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
BRUTUS:
And every man hence to his idle bed,
BRUTUS:
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
BRUTUS:
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
BRUTUS:
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
BRUTUS:
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
BRUTUS:
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
BRUTUS:
What need we any spur but our own cause,
BRUTUS:
To prick us to redress? what other bond
BRUTUS:
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
BRUTUS:
And will not palter? and what other oath
BRUTUS:
Than honesty to honesty engaged,
BRUTUS:
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
BRUTUS:
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
BRUTUS:
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
BRUTUS:
That welcome wrongs, unto bad causes swear
BRUTUS:
Such creatures as men doubt, but do not stain
BRUTUS:
The even virtue of our enterprise,
BRUTUS:
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
BRUTUS:
To think that or our cause or our performance
BRUTUS:
Did need an oath, when every drop of blood
BRUTUS:
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
BRUTUS:
Is guilty of a several bastardy,
BRUTUS:
If he do break the smallest particle
BRUTUS:
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
CASSIUS:
But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
CASSIUS:
I think he will stand very strong with us.
CASCA:
Let us not leave him out.
CINNA:
No, by no means.
METELLUS CIMBER:
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
METELLUS CIMBER:
Will purchase us a good opinion
METELLUS CIMBER:
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds
METELLUS CIMBER:
It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands,
METELLUS CIMBER:
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
METELLUS CIMBER:
But all be buried in his gravity.
BRUTUS:
O, name him not: let us not break with him,
BRUTUS:
For he will never follow any thing
BRUTUS:
That other men begin.
CASSIUS:
Then leave him out.
CASCA:
Indeed he is not fit.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
CASSIUS:
Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
CASSIUS:
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
CASSIUS:
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
CASSIUS:
A shrewd contriver, and, you know, his means,
CASSIUS:
If he improve them, may well stretch so far
CASSIUS:
As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
CASSIUS:
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
BRUTUS:
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
BRUTUS:
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
BRUTUS:
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards,
BRUTUS:
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar
BRUTUS:
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
BRUTUS:
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,
BRUTUS:
And in the spirit of men there is no blood
BRUTUS:
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
BRUTUS:
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
BRUTUS:
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
BRUTUS:
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully,
BRUTUS:
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
BRUTUS:
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
BRUTUS:
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
BRUTUS:
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
BRUTUS:
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
BRUTUS:
Our purpose necessary and not envious
BRUTUS:
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
BRUTUS:
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
BRUTUS:
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,
BRUTUS:
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
BRUTUS:
When Caesar's head is off.
CASSIUS:
Yet I fear him,
CASSIUS:
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
BRUTUS:
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him
BRUTUS:
If he love Caesar, all that he can do
BRUTUS:
Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar
BRUTUS:
And that were much he should, for he is given
BRUTUS:
To sports, to wildness and much company.
TREBONIUS:
There is no fear in him, let him not die,
TREBONIUS:
For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
TREBONIUS:
Clock strikes
BRUTUS:
Peace! count the clock.
CASSIUS:
The clock hath stricken three.
TREBONIUS:
'Tis time to part.
CASSIUS:
But it is doubtful yet,
CASSIUS:
Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no,
CASSIUS:
For he is superstitious grown of late,
CASSIUS:
Quite from the main opinion he held once
CASSIUS:
Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies
CASSIUS:
It may be, these apparent prodigies,
CASSIUS:
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
CASSIUS:
And the persuasion of his augurers,
CASSIUS:
May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear
DECIUS BRUTUS:
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Lions with toils and men with flatterers,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
He says he does, being then most flattered.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Let me work,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
For I can give his humour the true bent,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
And I will bring him to the Capitol.
CASSIUS:
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
BRUTUS:
By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
CINNA:
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
METELLUS CIMBER:
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
METELLUS CIMBER:
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
METELLUS CIMBER:
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
BRUTUS:
Now, good Metellus, go along by him
BRUTUS:
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons,
BRUTUS:
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
CASSIUS:
The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
CASSIUS:
And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember
CASSIUS:
What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
BRUTUS:
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily,
BRUTUS:
Let not our looks put on our purposes,
BRUTUS:
But bear it as our Roman actors do,
BRUTUS:
With untired spirits and formal constancy
BRUTUS:
And so good morrow to you every one.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt all but BRUTUS
BRUTUS:
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter,
BRUTUS:
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber
BRUTUS:
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
BRUTUS:
Which busy care draws in the brains of men,
BRUTUS:
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
BRUTUS:
Enter PORTIA
PORTIA:
Brutus, my lord!
BRUTUS:
Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
BRUTUS:
It is not for your health thus to commit
BRUTUS:
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
PORTIA:
Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
PORTIA:
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
PORTIA:
You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
PORTIA:
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
PORTIA:
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
PORTIA:
You stared upon me with ungentle looks,
PORTIA:
I urged you further, then you scratch'd your head,
PORTIA:
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot,
PORTIA:
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
PORTIA:
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
PORTIA:
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did,
PORTIA:
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
PORTIA:
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
PORTIA:
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
PORTIA:
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
PORTIA:
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
PORTIA:
And could it work so much upon your shape
PORTIA:
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
PORTIA:
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
PORTIA:
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
BRUTUS:
I am not well in health, and that is all.
PORTIA:
Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
PORTIA:
He would embrace the means to come by it.
BRUTUS:
Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
PORTIA:
Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
PORTIA:
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
PORTIA:
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
PORTIA:
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
PORTIA:
To dare the vile contagion of the night
PORTIA:
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
PORTIA:
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,
PORTIA:
You have some sick offence within your mind,
PORTIA:
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
PORTIA:
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
PORTIA:
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
PORTIA:
By all your vows of love and that great vow
PORTIA:
Which did incorporate and make us one,
PORTIA:
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
PORTIA:
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
PORTIA:
Have had to resort to you: for here have been
PORTIA:
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
PORTIA:
Even from darkness.
BRUTUS:
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
PORTIA:
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
PORTIA:
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
PORTIA:
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
PORTIA:
That appertain to you? Am I yourself
PORTIA:
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
PORTIA:
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
PORTIA:
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
PORTIA:
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
PORTIA:
Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
BRUTUS:
You are my true and honourable wife,
BRUTUS:
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
BRUTUS:
That visit my sad heart
PORTIA:
If this were true, then should I know this secret.
PORTIA:
I grant I am a woman, but withal
PORTIA:
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
PORTIA:
I grant I am a woman, but withal
PORTIA:
A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
PORTIA:
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
PORTIA:
Being so father'd and so husbanded?
PORTIA:
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em
PORTIA:
I have made strong proof of my constancy,
PORTIA:
Giving myself a voluntary wound
PORTIA:
Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
PORTIA:
And not my husband's secrets?
BRUTUS:
O ye gods,
BRUTUS:
Render me worthy of this noble wife!
BRUTUS:
Knocking within
BRUTUS:
Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile,
BRUTUS:
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
BRUTUS:
The secrets of my heart.
BRUTUS:
All my engagements I will construe to thee,
BRUTUS:
All the charactery of my sad brows
BRUTUS:
Leave me with haste.
BRUTUS:
Exit PORTIA
BRUTUS:
Lucius, who's that knocks?
BRUTUS:
Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS
LUCIUS:
He is a sick man that would speak with you.
BRUTUS:
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
BRUTUS:
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?
LIGARIUS:
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
BRUTUS:
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
BRUTUS:
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
LIGARIUS:
I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
LIGARIUS:
Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
BRUTUS:
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
BRUTUS:
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
LIGARIUS:
By all the gods that Romans bow before,
LIGARIUS:
I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
LIGARIUS:
Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
LIGARIUS:
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
LIGARIUS:
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
LIGARIUS:
And I will strive with things impossible,
LIGARIUS:
Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
BRUTUS:
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
LIGARIUS:
But are not some whole that we must make sick?
BRUTUS:
That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
BRUTUS:
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
BRUTUS:
To whom it must be done.
LIGARIUS:
Set on your foot,
LIGARIUS:
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
LIGARIUS:
To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
LIGARIUS:
That Brutus leads me on.
BRUTUS:
Follow me, then.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt
BRUTUS:
SCENE II. CAESAR's house.
BRUTUS:
Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown
CAESAR:
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night
CAESAR:
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
CAESAR:
'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?
CAESAR:
Enter a Servant
Servant:
My lord?
CAESAR:
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
CAESAR:
And bring me their opinions of success.
Servant:
I will, my lord.
Servant:
Exit
Servant:
Enter CALPURNIA
CALPURNIA:
What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
CALPURNIA:
You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
CAESAR:
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
CAESAR:
Ne'er look'd but on my back, when they shall see
CAESAR:
The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
CALPURNIA:
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
CALPURNIA:
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
CALPURNIA:
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
CALPURNIA:
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
CALPURNIA:
A lioness hath whelped in the streets,
CALPURNIA:
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead,
CALPURNIA:
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
CALPURNIA:
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
CALPURNIA:
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol,
CALPURNIA:
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
CALPURNIA:
Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
CALPURNIA:
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
CALPURNIA:
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
CALPURNIA:
And I do fear them.
CAESAR:
What can be avoided
CAESAR:
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
CAESAR:
Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions
CAESAR:
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
CALPURNIA:
When beggars die, there are no comets seen,
CALPURNIA:
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
CAESAR:
Cowards die many times before their deaths,
CAESAR:
The valiant never taste of death but once.
CAESAR:
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
CAESAR:
It seems to me most strange that men should fear,
CAESAR:
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
CAESAR:
Will come when it will come.
CAESAR:
Re-enter Servant
CAESAR:
What say the augurers?
Servant:
They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
Servant:
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
Servant:
They could not find a heart within the beast.
CAESAR:
The gods do this in shame of cowardice
CAESAR:
Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
CAESAR:
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
CAESAR:
No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
CAESAR:
That Caesar is more dangerous than he
CAESAR:
We are two lions litter'd in one day,
CAESAR:
And I the elder and more terrible
CAESAR:
And Caesar shall go forth.
CALPURNIA:
Alas, my lord,
CALPURNIA:
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
CALPURNIA:
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
CALPURNIA:
That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
CALPURNIA:
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house
CALPURNIA:
And he shall say you are not well to-day
CALPURNIA:
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
CAESAR:
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
CAESAR:
And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
CAESAR:
Enter DECIUS BRUTUS
CAESAR:
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar
DECIUS BRUTUS:
I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
CAESAR:
And you are come in very happy time,
CAESAR:
To bear my greeting to the senators
CAESAR:
And tell them that I will not come to-day
CAESAR:
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser
CAESAR:
I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
CALPURNIA:
Say he is sick.
CAESAR:
Shall Caesar send a lie?
CAESAR:
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
CAESAR:
To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
CAESAR:
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
CAESAR:
The cause is in my will: I will not come,
CAESAR:
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
CAESAR:
But for your private satisfaction,
CAESAR:
Because I love you, I will let you know
CAESAR:
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home
CAESAR:
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
CAESAR:
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
CAESAR:
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
CAESAR:
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it
CAESAR:
And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
CAESAR:
And evils imminent, and on her knee
CAESAR:
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
This dream is all amiss interpreted,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
It was a vision fair and fortunate
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
DECIUS BRUTUS:
For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
CAESAR:
And this way have you well expounded it.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
I have, when you have heard what I can say
DECIUS BRUTUS:
And know it now: the senate have concluded
DECIUS BRUTUS:
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
If you shall send them word you will not come,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
DECIUS BRUTUS:
'Break up the senate till another time,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
DECIUS BRUTUS:
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
DECIUS BRUTUS:
'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love
DECIUS BRUTUS:
To our proceeding bids me tell you this,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
And reason to my love is liable.
CAESAR:
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
CAESAR:
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
CAESAR:
Give me my robe, for I will go.
CAESAR:
Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA
CAESAR:
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
PUBLIUS:
Good morrow, Caesar.
CAESAR:
Welcome, Publius.
CAESAR:
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
CAESAR:
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
CAESAR:
Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
CAESAR:
As that same ague which hath made you lean.
CAESAR:
What is 't o'clock?
BRUTUS:
Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
CAESAR:
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
CAESAR:
Enter ANTONY
CAESAR:
See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
CAESAR:
Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.
ANTONY:
So to most noble Caesar.
CAESAR:
Bid them prepare within
CAESAR:
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
CAESAR:
Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
CAESAR:
I have an hour's talk in store for you,
CAESAR:
Remember that you call on me to-day
CAESAR:
Be near me, that I may remember you.
TREBONIUS:
Caesar, I will
TREBONIUS:
Aside
TREBONIUS:
and so near will I be,
TREBONIUS:
That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
CAESAR:
Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me,
CAESAR:
And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
BRUTUS:
[Aside]  That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
BRUTUS:
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!
BRUTUS:
Exeunt
BRUTUS:
SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.
BRUTUS:
Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper
ARTEMIDORUS:
'Caesar, beware of Brutus, take heed of Cassius,
ARTEMIDORUS:
come not near Casca, have an eye to Cinna, trust not
ARTEMIDORUS:
Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
ARTEMIDORUS:
loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
ARTEMIDORUS:
There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
ARTEMIDORUS:
bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
ARTEMIDORUS:
look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
ARTEMIDORUS:
The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
ARTEMIDORUS:
'ARTEMIDORUS.'
ARTEMIDORUS:
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
ARTEMIDORUS:
And as a suitor will I give him this.
ARTEMIDORUS:
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
ARTEMIDORUS:
Out of the teeth of emulation.
ARTEMIDORUS:
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live,
ARTEMIDORUS:
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
ARTEMIDORUS:
Exit
ARTEMIDORUS:
SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.
ARTEMIDORUS:
Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS
PORTIA:
I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house,
PORTIA:
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone
PORTIA:
Why dost thou stay?
LUCIUS:
To know my errand, madam.
PORTIA:
I would have had thee there, and here again,
PORTIA:
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
PORTIA:
O constancy, be strong upon my side,
PORTIA:
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
PORTIA:
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
PORTIA:
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
PORTIA:
Art thou here yet?
LUCIUS:
Madam, what should I do?
LUCIUS:
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
LUCIUS:
And so return to you, and nothing else?
PORTIA:
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
PORTIA:
For he went sickly forth: and take good note
PORTIA:
What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
PORTIA:
Hark, boy! what noise is that?
LUCIUS:
I hear none, madam.
PORTIA:
Prithee, listen well,
PORTIA:
I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
PORTIA:
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
LUCIUS:
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
LUCIUS:
Enter the Soothsayer
PORTIA:
Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
Soothsayer:
At mine own house, good lady.
PORTIA:
What is't o'clock?
Soothsayer:
About the ninth hour, lady.
PORTIA:
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
Soothsayer:
Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
Soothsayer:
To see him pass on to the Capitol.
PORTIA:
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
Soothsayer:
That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
Soothsayer:
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
Soothsayer:
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
PORTIA:
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
Soothsayer:
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
Soothsayer:
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow
Soothsayer:
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
Soothsayer:
Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
Soothsayer:
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death
Soothsayer:
I'll get me to a place more void, and there
Soothsayer:
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
Soothsayer:
Exit
PORTIA:
I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
PORTIA:
The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
PORTIA:
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
PORTIA:
Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
PORTIA:
That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
PORTIA:
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord,
PORTIA:
Say I am merry: come to me again,
PORTIA:
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
PORTIA:
Exeunt severally
PORTIA:
ACT III
PORTIA:
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol, the Senate sitting above.
PORTIA:
A crowd of people, among them ARTEMIDORUS and the  Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER,  TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS, PUBLIUS, and others
CAESAR:
[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.
Soothsayer:
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
ARTEMIDORUS:
Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
ARTEMIDORUS:
O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit
ARTEMIDORUS:
That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.
CAESAR:
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
ARTEMIDORUS:
Delay not, Caesar, read it instantly.
CAESAR:
What, is the fellow mad?
PUBLIUS:
Sirrah, give place.
CASSIUS:
What, urge you your petitions in the street?
CASSIUS:
Come to the Capitol.
CASSIUS:
CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest following
POPILIUS:
I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
CASSIUS:
What enterprise, Popilius?
POPILIUS:
Fare you well.
POPILIUS:
Advances to CAESAR
BRUTUS:
What said Popilius Lena?
CASSIUS:
He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
CASSIUS:
I fear our purpose is discovered.
BRUTUS:
Look, how he makes to Caesar, mark him.
CASSIUS:
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
CASSIUS:
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
CASSIUS:
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
CASSIUS:
For I will slay myself.
BRUTUS:
Cassius, be constant
BRUTUS:
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,
BRUTUS:
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
CASSIUS:
Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus.
CASSIUS:
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
CASSIUS:
Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
DECIUS BRUTUS:
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
BRUTUS:
He is address'd: press near and second him.
CINNA:
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
CAESAR:
Are we all ready? What is now amiss
CAESAR:
That Caesar and his senate must redress?
METELLUS CIMBER:
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
METELLUS CIMBER:
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
METELLUS CIMBER:
An humble heart,--
METELLUS CIMBER:
Kneeling
CAESAR:
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
CAESAR:
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
CAESAR:
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
CAESAR:
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
CAESAR:
Into the law of children. Be not fond,
CAESAR:
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
CAESAR:
That will be thaw'd from the true quality
CAESAR:
With that which melteth fools, I mean, sweet words,
CAESAR:
Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
CAESAR:
Thy brother by decree is banished
CAESAR:
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
CAESAR:
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
CAESAR:
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
CAESAR:
Will he be satisfied.
METELLUS CIMBER:
Is there no voice more worthy than my own
METELLUS CIMBER:
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
METELLUS CIMBER:
For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
BRUTUS:
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,
BRUTUS:
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
BRUTUS:
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
CAESAR:
What, Brutus!
CASSIUS:
Pardon, Caesar, Caesar, pardon
CASSIUS:
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
CASSIUS:
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
CASSIUS:
I could be well moved, if I were as you
CASSIUS:
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me
CASSIUS:
But I am constant as the northern star,
CASSIUS:
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
CASSIUS:
There is no fellow in the firmament.
CASSIUS:
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
CASSIUS:
They are all fire and every one doth shine,
CASSIUS:
But there's but one in all doth hold his place
CASSIUS:
So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,
CASSIUS:
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive,
CASSIUS:
Yet in the number I do know but one
CASSIUS:
That unassailable holds on his rank,
CASSIUS:
Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
CASSIUS:
Let me a little show it, even in this,
CASSIUS:
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
CASSIUS:
And constant do remain to keep him so.
CINNA:
O Caesar,--
CAESAR:
Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
DECIUS BRUTUS:
Great Caesar,--
CAESAR:
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
CASCA:
Speak, hands for me!
CASCA:
CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESAR
CAESAR:
Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
CAESAR:
Dies
CINNA:
Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
CINNA:
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
CASSIUS:
Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
CASSIUS:
'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'
BRUTUS:
People and senators, be not affrighted,
BRUTUS:
Fly not, stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
CASCA:
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
And Cassius too.
BRUTUS:
Where's Publius?
CINNA:
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
METELLUS CIMBER:
Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
METELLUS CIMBER:
Should chance--
BRUTUS:
Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer,
BRUTUS:
There is no harm intended to your person,
BRUTUS:
Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.
CASSIUS:
And leave us, Publius, lest that the people,
CASSIUS:
Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
BRUTUS:
Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
BRUTUS:
But we the doers.
BRUTUS:
Re-enter TREBONIUS
CASSIUS:
Where is Antony?
TREBONIUS:
Fled to his house amazed
TREBONIUS:
Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
TREBONIUS:
As it were doomsday.
BRUTUS:
Fates, we will know your pleasures
BRUTUS:
That we shall die, we know, 'tis but the time
BRUTUS:
And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
CASSIUS:
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
CASSIUS:
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
BRUTUS:
Grant that, and then is death a benefit
BRUTUS:
So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
BRUTUS:
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
BRUTUS:
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
BRUTUS:
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords
BRUTUS:
Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
BRUTUS:
And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
BRUTUS:
Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'
CASSIUS:
Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
CASSIUS:
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
CASSIUS:
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
BRUTUS:
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
BRUTUS:
That now on Pompey's basis lies along
BRUTUS:
No worthier than the dust!
CASSIUS:
So oft as that shall be,
CASSIUS:
So often shall the knot of us be call'd
CASSIUS:
The men that gave their country liberty.
DECIUS BRUTUS:
What, shall we forth?
CASSIUS:
Ay, every man away
CASSIUS:
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels
CASSIUS:
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
CASSIUS:
Enter a Servant
BRUTUS:
Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
Servant:
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel
Servant:
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,
Servant:
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say
Servant:
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest,
Servant:
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving
Servant:
Say I love Brutus, and I honour him,
Servant:
Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.
Servant:
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
Servant:
May safely come to him, and be resolved
Servant:
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
Servant:
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
Servant:
So well as Brutus living, but will follow
Servant:
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
Servant:
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
Servant:
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
BRUTUS:
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman,
BRUTUS:
I never thought him worse.
BRUTUS:
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
BRUTUS:
He shall be satisfied, and, by my honour,
BRUTUS:
Depart untouch'd.
Servant:
I'll fetch him presently.
Servant:
Exit
BRUTUS:
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
CASSIUS:
I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
CASSIUS:
That fears him much, and my misgiving still
CASSIUS:
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
BRUTUS:
But here comes Antony.
BRUTUS:
Re-enter ANTONY
BRUTUS:
Welcome, Mark Antony.
ANTONY:
O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY:
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
ANTONY:
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
ANTONY:
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
ANTONY:
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank
ANTONY:
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
ANTONY:
As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
ANTONY:
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
ANTONY:
With the most noble blood of all this world.
ANTONY:
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
ANTONY:
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
ANTONY:
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
ANTONY:
I shall not find myself so apt to die
ANTONY:
No place will please me so, no mean of death,
ANTONY:
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
ANTONY:
The choice and master spirits of this age.
BRUTUS:
O Antony, beg not your death of us.
BRUTUS:
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
BRUTUS:
As, by our hands and this our present act,
BRUTUS:
You see we do, yet see you but our hands
BRUTUS:
And this the bleeding business they have done
BRUTUS:
Our hearts you see not, they are pitiful,
BRUTUS:
And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
BRUTUS:
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
BRUTUS:
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
BRUTUS:
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony
BRUTUS:
Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
BRUTUS:
Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
BRUTUS:
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
CASSIUS:
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
CASSIUS:
In the disposing of new dignities.
BRUTUS:
Only be patient till we have appeased
BRUTUS:
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
BRUTUS:
And then we will deliver you the cause,
BRUTUS:
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
BRUTUS:
Have thus proceeded.
ANTONY:
I doubt not of your wisdom.
ANTONY:
Let each man render me his bloody hand
ANTONY:
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you,
ANTONY:
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand,
ANTONY:
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus,
ANTONY:
Yours, Cinna, and, my valiant Casca, yours,
ANTONY:
Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
ANTONY:
Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
ANTONY:
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
ANTONY:
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
ANTONY:
Either a coward or a flatterer.
ANTONY:
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true
ANTONY:
If then thy spirit look upon us now,
ANTONY:
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
ANTONY:
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
ANTONY:
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
ANTONY:
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
ANTONY:
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
ANTONY:
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
ANTONY:
It would become me better than to close
ANTONY:
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
ANTONY:
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,
ANTONY:
Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,
ANTONY:
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
ANTONY:
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,
ANTONY:
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
ANTONY:
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
ANTONY:
Dost thou here lie!
CASSIUS:
Mark Antony,--
ANTONY:
Pardon me, Caius Cassius
ANTONY:
The enemies of Caesar shall say this,
ANTONY:
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
CASSIUS:
I blame you not for praising Caesar so,
CASSIUS:
But what compact mean you to have with us?
CASSIUS:
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,
CASSIUS:
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
ANTONY:
Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
ANTONY:
Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
ANTONY:
Friends am I with you all and love you all,
ANTONY:
Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
ANTONY:
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
BRUTUS:
Or else were this a savage spectacle
BRUTUS:
Our reasons are so full of good regard
BRUTUS:
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
BRUTUS:
You should be satisfied.
ANTONY:
That's all I seek
ANTONY:
And am moreover suitor that I may
ANTONY:
Produce his body to the market-place,
ANTONY:
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
ANTONY:
Speak in the order of his funeral.
BRUTUS:
You shall, Mark Antony.
CASSIUS:
Brutus, a word with you.
CASSIUS:
Aside to BRUTUS
CASSIUS:
You know not what you do: do not consent
CASSIUS:
That Antony speak in his funeral
CASSIUS:
Know you how much the people may be moved
CASSIUS:
By that which he will utter?
BRUTUS:
By your pardon,
BRUTUS:
I will myself into the pulpit first,
BRUTUS:
And show the reason of our Caesar's death
BRUTUS:
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
BRUTUS:
He speaks by leave and by permission,
BRUTUS:
And that we are contented Caesar shall
BRUTUS:
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
BRUTUS:
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
CASSIUS:
I know not what may fall, I like it not.
BRUTUS:
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
BRUTUS:
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
BRUTUS:
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
BRUTUS:
And say you do't by our permission,
BRUTUS:
Else shall you not have any hand at all
BRUTUS:
About his funeral: and you shall speak
BRUTUS:
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
BRUTUS:
After my speech is ended.
ANTONY:
Be it so.
ANTONY:
I do desire no more.
BRUTUS:
Prepare the body then, and follow us.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt all but ANTONY
ANTONY:
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
ANTONY:
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
ANTONY:
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
ANTONY:
That ever lived in the tide of times.
ANTONY:
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
ANTONY:
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
ANTONY:
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
ANTONY:
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
ANTONY:
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men,
ANTONY:
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
ANTONY:
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy,
ANTONY:
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
ANTONY:
And dreadful objects so familiar
ANTONY:
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
ANTONY:
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war,
ANTONY:
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
ANTONY:
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
ANTONY:
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
ANTONY:
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
ANTONY:
Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war,
ANTONY:
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
ANTONY:
With carrion men, groaning for burial.
ANTONY:
Enter a Servant
ANTONY:
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
Servant:
I do, Mark Antony.
ANTONY:
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
Servant:
He did receive his letters, and is coming,
Servant:
And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
Servant:
O Caesar!--
Servant:
Seeing the body
ANTONY:
Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY:
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,
ANTONY:
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
ANTONY:
Began to water. Is thy master coming?
Servant:
He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
ANTONY:
Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced
ANTONY:
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
ANTONY:
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet,
ANTONY:
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile,
ANTONY:
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
ANTONY:
Into the market-place: there shall I try
ANTONY:
In my oration, how the people take
ANTONY:
The cruel issue of these bloody men,
ANTONY:
According to the which, thou shalt discourse
ANTONY:
To young Octavius of the state of things.
ANTONY:
Lend me your hand.
ANTONY:
Exeunt with CAESAR's body
ANTONY:
SCENE II. The Forum.
ANTONY:
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens
Citizens:
We will be satisfied, let us be satisfied.
BRUTUS:
Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
BRUTUS:
Cassius, go you into the other street,
BRUTUS:
And part the numbers.
BRUTUS:
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here,
BRUTUS:
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him,
BRUTUS:
And public reasons shall be rendered
BRUTUS:
Of Caesar's death.
First Citizen:
I will hear Brutus speak.
Second Citizen:
I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons,
Second Citizen:
When severally we hear them rendered.
Second Citizen:
Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit
Third Citizen:
The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
BRUTUS:
Be patient till the last.
BRUTUS:
Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
BRUTUS:
cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
BRUTUS:
for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
BRUTUS:
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
BRUTUS:
awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
BRUTUS:
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
BRUTUS:
Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
BRUTUS:
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
BRUTUS:
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer
BRUTUS:
--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
BRUTUS:
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
BRUTUS:
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
BRUTUS:
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him,
BRUTUS:
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it, as he was
BRUTUS:
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
BRUTUS:
slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his
BRUTUS:
fortune, honour for his valour, and death for his
BRUTUS:
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
BRUTUS:
bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended.
BRUTUS:
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
BRUTUS:
any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so
BRUTUS:
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak,
BRUTUS:
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
All:
None, Brutus, none.
BRUTUS:
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
BRUTUS:
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
BRUTUS:
his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not
BRUTUS:
extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
BRUTUS:
enforced, for which he suffered death.
BRUTUS:
Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body
BRUTUS:
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
BRUTUS:
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
BRUTUS:
the benefit of his dying, a place in the
BRUTUS:
commonwealth, as which of you shall not? With this
BRUTUS:
I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
BRUTUS:
good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
BRUTUS:
when it shall please my country to need my death.
All:
Live, Brutus! live, live!
First Citizen:
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
Second Citizen:
Give him a statue with his ancestors.
Third Citizen:
Let him be Caesar.
Fourth Citizen:
Caesar's better parts
Fourth Citizen:
Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
First Citizen:
We'll bring him to his house
First Citizen:
With shouts and clamours.
BRUTUS:
My countrymen,--
Second Citizen:
Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
First Citizen:
Peace, ho!
BRUTUS:
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
BRUTUS:
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony
BRUTUS:
Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
BRUTUS:
Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony,
BRUTUS:
By our permission, is allow'd to make.
BRUTUS:
I do entreat you, not a man depart,
BRUTUS:
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
BRUTUS:
Exit
First Citizen:
Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.
Third Citizen:
Let him go up into the public chair,
Third Citizen:
We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
ANTONY:
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY:
Goes into the pulpit
Fourth Citizen:
What does he say of Brutus?
Third Citizen:
He says, for Brutus' sake,
Third Citizen:
He finds himself beholding to us all.
Fourth Citizen:
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
First Citizen:
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Third Citizen:
Nay, that's certain
Third Citizen:
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
Second Citizen:
Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
ANTONY:
You gentle Romans,--
Citizens:
Peace, ho! let us hear him.
ANTONY:
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears,
ANTONY:
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
ANTONY:
The evil that men do lives after them,
ANTONY:
The good is oft interred with their bones,
ANTONY:
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
ANTONY:
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious
ANTONY:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
ANTONY:
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
ANTONY:
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
ANTONY:
For Brutus is an honourable man,
ANTONY:
So are they all, all honourable men--
ANTONY:
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
ANTONY:
He was my friend, faithful and just to me
ANTONY:
But Brutus says he was ambitious,
ANTONY:
And Brutus is an honourable man.
ANTONY:
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
ANTONY:
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
ANTONY:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
ANTONY:
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept
ANTONY:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff
ANTONY:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
ANTONY:
And Brutus is an honourable man.
ANTONY:
You all did see that on the Lupercal
ANTONY:
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
ANTONY:
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
ANTONY:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
ANTONY:
And, sure, he is an honourable man.
ANTONY:
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
ANTONY:
But here I am to speak what I do know.
ANTONY:
You all did love him once, not without cause
ANTONY:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
ANTONY:
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
ANTONY:
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me,
ANTONY:
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
ANTONY:
And I must pause till it come back to me.
First Citizen:
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
Second Citizen:
If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Second Citizen:
Caesar has had great wrong.
Third Citizen:
Has he, masters?
Third Citizen:
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
Fourth Citizen:
Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown,
Fourth Citizen:
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
First Citizen:
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
Second Citizen:
Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
Third Citizen:
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
Fourth Citizen:
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
ANTONY:
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
ANTONY:
Have stood against the world, now lies he there.
ANTONY:
And none so poor to do him reverence.
ANTONY:
O masters, if I were disposed to stir
ANTONY:
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
ANTONY:
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
ANTONY:
Who, you all know, are honourable men
ANTONY:
I will not do them wrong, I rather choose
ANTONY:
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
ANTONY:
Than I will wrong such honourable men.
ANTONY:
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar,
ANTONY:
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will
ANTONY:
Let but the commons hear this testament--
ANTONY:
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
ANTONY:
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
ANTONY:
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
ANTONY:
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
ANTONY:
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
ANTONY:
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
ANTONY:
Unto their issue.
Fourth Citizen:
We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
All:
The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
ANTONY:
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it,
ANTONY:
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
ANTONY:
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men,
ANTONY:
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
ANTONY:
It will inflame you, it will make you mad
ANTONY:
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
ANTONY:
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
Fourth Citizen:
Read the will, we'll hear it, Antony,
Fourth Citizen:
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
ANTONY:
Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
ANTONY:
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
ANTONY:
I fear I wrong the honourable men
ANTONY:
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar, I do fear it.
Fourth Citizen:
They were traitors: honourable men!
All:
The will! the testament!
Second Citizen:
They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
ANTONY:
You will compel me, then, to read the will?
ANTONY:
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
ANTONY:
And let me show you him that made the will.
ANTONY:
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
Several Citizens:
Come down.
Second Citizen:
Descend.
Third Citizen:
You shall have leave.
Third Citizen:
ANTONY comes down
Fourth Citizen:
A ring, stand round.
First Citizen:
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
Second Citizen:
Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
ANTONY:
Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.
Several Citizens:
Stand back, room, bear back.
ANTONY:
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
ANTONY:
You all do know this mantle: I remember
ANTONY:
The first time ever Caesar put it on,
ANTONY:
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
ANTONY:
That day he overcame the Nervii
ANTONY:
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through
ANTONY:
See what a rent the envious Casca made
ANTONY:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd,
ANTONY:
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
ANTONY:
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
ANTONY:
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
ANTONY:
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no,
ANTONY:
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel
ANTONY:
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
ANTONY:
This was the most unkindest cut of all,
ANTONY:
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
ANTONY:
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
ANTONY:
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart,
ANTONY:
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
ANTONY:
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
ANTONY:
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
ANTONY:
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
ANTONY:
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
ANTONY:
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
ANTONY:
O, now you weep, and, I perceive, you feel
ANTONY:
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
ANTONY:
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
ANTONY:
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
ANTONY:
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
First Citizen:
O piteous spectacle!
Second Citizen:
O noble Caesar!
Third Citizen:
O woful day!
Fourth Citizen:
O traitors, villains!
First Citizen:
O most bloody sight!
Second Citizen:
We will be revenged.
All:
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
All:
Let not a traitor live!
ANTONY:
Stay, countrymen.
First Citizen:
Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
Second Citizen:
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
ANTONY:
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ANTONY:
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
ANTONY:
They that have done this deed are honourable
ANTONY:
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
ANTONY:
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
ANTONY:
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
ANTONY:
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts
ANTONY:
I am no orator, as Brutus is,
ANTONY:
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
ANTONY:
That love my friend, and that they know full well
ANTONY:
That gave me public leave to speak of him
ANTONY:
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
ANTONY:
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
ANTONY:
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on,
ANTONY:
I tell you that which you yourselves do know,
ANTONY:
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
ANTONY:
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
ANTONY:
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
ANTONY:
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
ANTONY:
In every wound of Caesar that should move
ANTONY:
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
All:
We'll mutiny.
First Citizen:
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
Third Citizen:
Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
ANTONY:
Yet hear me, countrymen, yet hear me speak.
All:
Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
ANTONY:
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what
ANTONY:
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
ANTONY:
Alas, you know not: I must tell you then
ANTONY:
You have forgot the will I told you of.
All:
Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
ANTONY:
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
ANTONY:
To every Roman citizen he gives,
ANTONY:
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
Second Citizen:
Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
Third Citizen:
O royal Caesar!
ANTONY:
Hear me with patience.
All:
Peace, ho!
ANTONY:
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
ANTONY:
His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
ANTONY:
On this side Tiber, he hath left them you,
ANTONY:
And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
ANTONY:
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
ANTONY:
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
First Citizen:
Never, never. Come, away, away!
First Citizen:
We'll burn his body in the holy place,
First Citizen:
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
First Citizen:
Take up the body.
Second Citizen:
Go fetch fire.
Third Citizen:
Pluck down benches.
Fourth Citizen:
Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
Fourth Citizen:
Exeunt Citizens with the body
ANTONY:
Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
ANTONY:
Take thou what course thou wilt!
ANTONY:
Enter a Servant
ANTONY:
How now, fellow!
Servant:
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
ANTONY:
Where is he?
Servant:
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
ANTONY:
And thither will I straight to visit him
ANTONY:
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
ANTONY:
And in this mood will give us any thing.
Servant:
I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
Servant:
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
ANTONY:
Belike they had some notice of the people,
ANTONY:
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
ANTONY:
Exeunt
ANTONY:
SCENE III. A street.
ANTONY:
Enter CINNA the poet
CINNA THE POET:
I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
CINNA THE POET:
And things unlucky charge my fantasy
CINNA THE POET:
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
CINNA THE POET:
Yet something leads me forth.
CINNA THE POET:
Enter Citizens
First Citizen:
What is your name?
Second Citizen:
Whither are you going?
Third Citizen:
Where do you dwell?
Fourth Citizen:
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Second Citizen:
Answer every man directly.
First Citizen:
Ay, and briefly.
Fourth Citizen:
Ay, and wisely.
Third Citizen:
Ay, and truly, you were best.
CINNA THE POET:
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
CINNA THE POET:
dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
CINNA THE POET:
answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
CINNA THE POET:
truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
Second Citizen:
That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry
Second Citizen:
you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed, directly.
CINNA THE POET:
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
First Citizen:
As a friend or an enemy?
CINNA THE POET:
As a friend.
Second Citizen:
That matter is answered directly.
Fourth Citizen:
For your dwelling,--briefly.
CINNA THE POET:
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
Third Citizen:
Your name, sir, truly.
CINNA THE POET:
Truly, my name is Cinna.
First Citizen:
Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.
CINNA THE POET:
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
Fourth Citizen:
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
CINNA THE POET:
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
Fourth Citizen:
It is no matter, his name's Cinna, pluck but his
Fourth Citizen:
name out of his heart, and turn him going.
Third Citizen:
Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands
Third Citizen:
to Brutus', to Cassius', burn all: some to Decius'
Third Citizen:
house, and some to Casca's, some to Ligarius': away, go!
Third Citizen:
Exeunt
Third Citizen:
ACT IV
Third Citizen:
SCENE I. A house in Rome.
Third Citizen:
ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table
ANTONY:
These many, then, shall die, their names are prick'd.
OCTAVIUS:
Your brother too must die, consent you, Lepidus?
LEPIDUS:
I do consent--
OCTAVIUS:
Prick him down, Antony.
LEPIDUS:
Upon condition Publius shall not live,
LEPIDUS:
Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
ANTONY:
He shall not live, look, with a spot I damn him.
ANTONY:
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house,
ANTONY:
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
ANTONY:
How to cut off some charge in legacies.
LEPIDUS:
What, shall I find you here?
OCTAVIUS:
Or here, or at the Capitol.
OCTAVIUS:
Exit LEPIDUS
ANTONY:
This is a slight unmeritable man,
ANTONY:
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
ANTONY:
The three-fold world divided, he should stand
ANTONY:
One of the three to share it?
OCTAVIUS:
So you thought him,
OCTAVIUS:
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
OCTAVIUS:
In our black sentence and proscription.
ANTONY:
Octavius, I have seen more days than you
ANTONY:
And though we lay these honours on this man,
ANTONY:
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
ANTONY:
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
ANTONY:
To groan and sweat under the business,
ANTONY:
Either led or driven, as we point the way,
ANTONY:
And having brought our treasure where we will,
ANTONY:
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
ANTONY:
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
ANTONY:
And graze in commons.
OCTAVIUS:
You may do your will,
OCTAVIUS:
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
ANTONY:
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
ANTONY:
I do appoint him store of provender
ANTONY:
It is a creature that I teach to fight,
ANTONY:
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
ANTONY:
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
ANTONY:
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so,
ANTONY:
He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth,
ANTONY:
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
ANTONY:
On abjects, orts and imitations,
ANTONY:
Which, out of use and staled by other men,
ANTONY:
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
ANTONY:
But as a property. And now, Octavius,
ANTONY:
Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
ANTONY:
Are levying powers: we must straight make head
ANTONY:
Therefore let our alliance be combined,
ANTONY:
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
ANTONY:
And let us presently go sit in council,
ANTONY:
How covert matters may be best disclosed,
ANTONY:
And open perils surest answered.
OCTAVIUS:
Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
OCTAVIUS:
And bay'd about with many enemies,
OCTAVIUS:
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
OCTAVIUS:
Millions of mischiefs.
OCTAVIUS:
Exeunt
OCTAVIUS:
SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.
OCTAVIUS:
Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and Soldiers, TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them
BRUTUS:
Stand, ho!
LUCILIUS:
Give the word, ho! and stand.
BRUTUS:
What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
LUCILIUS:
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
LUCILIUS:
To do you salutation from his master.
BRUTUS:
He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
BRUTUS:
In his own change, or by ill officers,
BRUTUS:
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
BRUTUS:
Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
BRUTUS:
I shall be satisfied.
PINDARUS:
I do not doubt
PINDARUS:
But that my noble master will appear
PINDARUS:
Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
BRUTUS:
He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,
BRUTUS:
How he received you, let me be resolved.
LUCILIUS:
With courtesy and with respect enough,
LUCILIUS:
But not with such familiar instances,
LUCILIUS:
Nor with such free and friendly conference,
LUCILIUS:
As he hath used of old.
BRUTUS:
Thou hast described
BRUTUS:
A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
BRUTUS:
When love begins to sicken and decay,
BRUTUS:
It useth an enforced ceremony.
BRUTUS:
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith,
BRUTUS:
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
BRUTUS:
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle,
BRUTUS:
But when they should endure the bloody spur,
BRUTUS:
They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
BRUTUS:
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
LUCILIUS:
They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd,
LUCILIUS:
The greater part, the horse in general,
LUCILIUS:
Are come with Cassius.
BRUTUS:
Hark! he is arrived.
BRUTUS:
Low march within
BRUTUS:
March gently on to meet him.
BRUTUS:
Enter CASSIUS and his powers
CASSIUS:
Stand, ho!
BRUTUS:
Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
First Soldier:
Stand!
Second Soldier:
Stand!
Third Soldier:
Stand!
CASSIUS:
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
BRUTUS:
Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
BRUTUS:
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
CASSIUS:
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,
CASSIUS:
And when you do them--
BRUTUS:
Cassius, be content.
BRUTUS:
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
BRUTUS:
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
BRUTUS:
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
BRUTUS:
Let us not wrangle: bid them move away,
BRUTUS:
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
BRUTUS:
And I will give you audience.
CASSIUS:
Pindarus,
CASSIUS:
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
CASSIUS:
A little from this ground.
BRUTUS:
Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man
BRUTUS:
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
BRUTUS:
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt
BRUTUS:
SCENE III. Brutus's tent.
BRUTUS:
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS
CASSIUS:
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this
CASSIUS:
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
CASSIUS:
For taking bribes here of the Sardians,
CASSIUS:
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
CASSIUS:
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
BRUTUS:
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
CASSIUS:
In such a time as this it is not meet
CASSIUS:
That every nice offence should bear his comment.
BRUTUS:
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
BRUTUS:
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,
BRUTUS:
To sell and mart your offices for gold
BRUTUS:
To undeservers.
CASSIUS:
I an itching palm!
CASSIUS:
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
CASSIUS:
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
BRUTUS:
The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
BRUTUS:
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
CASSIUS:
Chastisement!
BRUTUS:
Remember March, the ides of March remember
BRUTUS:
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
BRUTUS:
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
BRUTUS:
And not for justice? What, shall one of us
BRUTUS:
That struck the foremost man of all this world
BRUTUS:
But for supporting robbers, shall we now
BRUTUS:
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
BRUTUS:
And sell the mighty space of our large honours
BRUTUS:
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
BRUTUS:
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
BRUTUS:
Than such a Roman.
CASSIUS:
Brutus, bay not me,
CASSIUS:
I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
CASSIUS:
To hedge me in, I am a soldier, I,
CASSIUS:
Older in practise, abler than yourself
CASSIUS:
To make conditions.
BRUTUS:
Go to, you are not, Cassius.
CASSIUS:
I am.
BRUTUS:
I say you are not.
CASSIUS:
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself,
CASSIUS:
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
BRUTUS:
Away, slight man!
CASSIUS:
Is't possible?
BRUTUS:
Hear me, for I will speak.
BRUTUS:
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
BRUTUS:
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
CASSIUS:
O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?
BRUTUS:
All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break,
BRUTUS:
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
BRUTUS:
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
BRUTUS:
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
BRUTUS:
Under your testy humour? By the gods
BRUTUS:
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
BRUTUS:
Though it do split you, for, from this day forth,
BRUTUS:
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
BRUTUS:
When you are waspish.
CASSIUS:
Is it come to this?
BRUTUS:
You say you are a better soldier
BRUTUS:
Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,
BRUTUS:
And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
BRUTUS:
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
CASSIUS:
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus,
CASSIUS:
I said, an elder soldier, not a better
CASSIUS:
Did I say 'better'?
BRUTUS:
If you did, I care not.
CASSIUS:
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
BRUTUS:
Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
CASSIUS:
I durst not!
BRUTUS:
No.
CASSIUS:
What, durst not tempt him!
BRUTUS:
For your life you durst not!
CASSIUS:
Do not presume too much upon my love,
CASSIUS:
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
BRUTUS:
You have done that you should be sorry for.
BRUTUS:
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
BRUTUS:
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
BRUTUS:
That they pass by me as the idle wind,
BRUTUS:
Which I respect not. I did send to you
BRUTUS:
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me
BRUTUS:
For I can raise no money by vile means
BRUTUS:
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
BRUTUS:
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
BRUTUS:
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
BRUTUS:
By any indirection: I did send
BRUTUS:
To you for gold to pay my legions,
BRUTUS:
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
BRUTUS:
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
BRUTUS:
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
BRUTUS:
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
BRUTUS:
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
BRUTUS:
Dash him to pieces!
CASSIUS:
I denied you not.
BRUTUS:
You did.
CASSIUS:
I did not: he was but a fool that brought
CASSIUS:
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart
CASSIUS:
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
CASSIUS:
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
BRUTUS:
I do not, till you practise them on me.
CASSIUS:
You love me not.
BRUTUS:
I do not like your faults.
CASSIUS:
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
BRUTUS:
A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
BRUTUS:
As huge as high Olympus.
CASSIUS:
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
CASSIUS:
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
CASSIUS:
For Cassius is aweary of the world,
CASSIUS:
Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother,
CASSIUS:
Cheque'd like a bondman, all his faults observed,
CASSIUS:
Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
CASSIUS:
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
CASSIUS:
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
CASSIUS:
And here my naked breast, within, a heart
CASSIUS:
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold
CASSIUS:
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth,
CASSIUS:
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart
CASSIUS:
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for, I know,
CASSIUS:
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
CASSIUS:
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
BRUTUS:
Sheathe your dagger
BRUTUS:
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope,
BRUTUS:
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
BRUTUS:
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
BRUTUS:
That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
BRUTUS:
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
BRUTUS:
And straight is cold again.
CASSIUS:
Hath Cassius lived
CASSIUS:
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
CASSIUS:
When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?
BRUTUS:
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
CASSIUS:
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
BRUTUS:
And my heart too.
CASSIUS:
O Brutus!
BRUTUS:
What's the matter?
CASSIUS:
Have not you love enough to bear with me,
CASSIUS:
When that rash humour which my mother gave me
CASSIUS:
Makes me forgetful?
BRUTUS:
Yes, Cassius, and, from henceforth,
BRUTUS:
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
BRUTUS:
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
Poet:
[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals,
Poet:
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
Poet:
They be alone.
LUCILIUS:
[Within]  You shall not come to them.
Poet:
[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.
Poet:
Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS
CASSIUS:
How now! what's the matter?
Poet:
For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
Poet:
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be,
Poet:
For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
CASSIUS:
Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
BRUTUS:
Get you hence, sirrah, saucy fellow, hence!
CASSIUS:
Bear with him, Brutus, 'tis his fashion.
BRUTUS:
I'll know his humour, when he knows his time
BRUTUS:
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
BRUTUS:
Companion, hence!
CASSIUS:
Away, away, be gone.
CASSIUS:
Exit Poet
BRUTUS:
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
BRUTUS:
Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
CASSIUS:
And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
CASSIUS:
Immediately to us.
CASSIUS:
Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS
BRUTUS:
Lucius, a bowl of wine!
BRUTUS:
Exit LUCIUS
CASSIUS:
I did not think you could have been so angry.
BRUTUS:
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
CASSIUS:
Of your philosophy you make no use,
CASSIUS:
If you give place to accidental evils.
BRUTUS:
No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
CASSIUS:
Ha! Portia!
BRUTUS:
She is dead.
CASSIUS:
How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
CASSIUS:
O insupportable and touching loss!
CASSIUS:
Upon what sickness?
BRUTUS:
Impatient of my absence,
BRUTUS:
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
BRUTUS:
Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
BRUTUS:
That tidings came,--with this she fell distract,
BRUTUS:
And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
CASSIUS:
And died so?
BRUTUS:
Even so.
CASSIUS:
O ye immortal gods!
CASSIUS:
Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper
BRUTUS:
Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
BRUTUS:
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
CASSIUS:
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
CASSIUS:
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup,
CASSIUS:
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
BRUTUS:
Come in, Titinius!
BRUTUS:
Exit LUCIUS
BRUTUS:
Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA
BRUTUS:
Welcome, good Messala.
BRUTUS:
Now sit we close about this taper here,
BRUTUS:
And call in question our necessities.
CASSIUS:
Portia, art thou gone?
BRUTUS:
No more, I pray you.
BRUTUS:
Messala, I have here received letters,
BRUTUS:
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
BRUTUS:
Come down upon us with a mighty power,
BRUTUS:
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
MESSALA:
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
BRUTUS:
With what addition?
MESSALA:
That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
MESSALA:
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
MESSALA:
Have put to death an hundred senators.
BRUTUS:
Therein our letters do not well agree,
BRUTUS:
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
BRUTUS:
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
CASSIUS:
Cicero one!
MESSALA:
Cicero is dead,
MESSALA:
And by that order of proscription.
MESSALA:
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
BRUTUS:
No, Messala.
MESSALA:
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
BRUTUS:
Nothing, Messala.
MESSALA:
That, methinks, is strange.
BRUTUS:
Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
MESSALA:
No, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
MESSALA:
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell
MESSALA:
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
BRUTUS:
Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala
BRUTUS:
With meditating that she must die once,
BRUTUS:
I have the patience to endure it now.
MESSALA:
Even so great men great losses should endure.
CASSIUS:
I have as much of this in art as you,
CASSIUS:
But yet my nature could not bear it so.
BRUTUS:
Well, to our work alive. What do you think
BRUTUS:
Of marching to Philippi presently?
CASSIUS:
I do not think it good.
BRUTUS:
Your reason?
CASSIUS:
This it is
CASSIUS:
'Tis better that the enemy seek us
CASSIUS:
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
CASSIUS:
Doing himself offence, whilst we, lying still,
CASSIUS:
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
BRUTUS:
Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
BRUTUS:
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
BRUTUS:
Do stand but in a forced affection,
BRUTUS:
For they have grudged us contribution
BRUTUS:
The enemy, marching along by them,
BRUTUS:
By them shall make a fuller number up,
BRUTUS:
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged,
BRUTUS:
From which advantage shall we cut him off,
BRUTUS:
If at Philippi we do face him there,
BRUTUS:
These people at our back.
CASSIUS:
Hear me, good brother.
BRUTUS:
Under your pardon. You must note beside,
BRUTUS:
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
BRUTUS:
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe
BRUTUS:
The enemy increaseth every day,
BRUTUS:
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
BRUTUS:
There is a tide in the affairs of men,
BRUTUS:
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune,
BRUTUS:
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
BRUTUS:
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
BRUTUS:
On such a full sea are we now afloat,
BRUTUS:
And we must take the current when it serves,
BRUTUS:
Or lose our ventures.
CASSIUS:
Then, with your will, go on,
CASSIUS:
We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
BRUTUS:
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
BRUTUS:
And nature must obey necessity,
BRUTUS:
Which we will niggard with a little rest.
BRUTUS:
There is no more to say?
CASSIUS:
No more. Good night
CASSIUS:
Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
BRUTUS:
Lucius!
BRUTUS:
Enter LUCIUS
BRUTUS:
My gown.
BRUTUS:
Exit LUCIUS
BRUTUS:
Farewell, good Messala
BRUTUS:
Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
BRUTUS:
Good night, and good repose.
CASSIUS:
O my dear brother!
CASSIUS:
This was an ill beginning of the night
CASSIUS:
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
CASSIUS:
Let it not, Brutus.
BRUTUS:
Every thing is well.
CASSIUS:
Good night, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Good night, good brother.
MESSALA:
Good night, Lord Brutus.
BRUTUS:
Farewell, every one.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt all but BRUTUS
BRUTUS:
Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown
BRUTUS:
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
LUCIUS:
Here in the tent.
BRUTUS:
What, thou speak'st drowsily?
BRUTUS:
Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'er-watch'd.
BRUTUS:
Call Claudius and some other of my men
BRUTUS:
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
LUCIUS:
Varro and Claudius!
LUCIUS:
Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS
VARRO:
Calls my lord?
BRUTUS:
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep,
BRUTUS:
It may be I shall raise you by and by
BRUTUS:
On business to my brother Cassius.
VARRO:
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
BRUTUS:
I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs,
BRUTUS:
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
BRUTUS:
Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so,
BRUTUS:
I put it in the pocket of my gown.
BRUTUS:
VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down
LUCIUS:
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
BRUTUS:
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
BRUTUS:
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
BRUTUS:
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
LUCIUS:
Ay, my lord, an't please you.
BRUTUS:
It does, my boy
BRUTUS:
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
LUCIUS:
It is my duty, sir.
BRUTUS:
I should not urge thy duty past thy might,
BRUTUS:
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
LUCIUS:
I have slept, my lord, already.
BRUTUS:
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again,
BRUTUS:
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
BRUTUS:
I will be good to thee.
BRUTUS:
Music, and a song
BRUTUS:
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
BRUTUS:
Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
BRUTUS:
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night,
BRUTUS:
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee
BRUTUS:
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument,
BRUTUS:
I'll take it from thee, and, good boy, good night.
BRUTUS:
Let me see, let me see, is not the leaf turn'd down
BRUTUS:
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
BRUTUS:
Enter the Ghost of CAESAR
BRUTUS:
How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
BRUTUS:
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
BRUTUS:
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
BRUTUS:
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
BRUTUS:
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
BRUTUS:
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
BRUTUS:
Speak to me what thou art.
GHOST:
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
BRUTUS:
Why comest thou?
GHOST:
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
BRUTUS:
Well, then I shall see thee again?
GHOST:
Ay, at Philippi.
BRUTUS:
Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
BRUTUS:
Exit Ghost
BRUTUS:
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest
BRUTUS:
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
BRUTUS:
Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!
LUCIUS:
The strings, my lord, are false.
BRUTUS:
He thinks he still is at his instrument.
BRUTUS:
Lucius, awake!
LUCIUS:
My lord?
BRUTUS:
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
LUCIUS:
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
BRUTUS:
Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
LUCIUS:
Nothing, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
BRUTUS:
To VARRO
BRUTUS:
Fellow thou, awake!
VARRO:
My lord?
CLAUDIUS:
My lord?
BRUTUS:
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
CLAUDIUS:
Did we, my lord?
BRUTUS:
Ay: saw you any thing?
VARRO:
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
CLAUDIUS:
Nor I, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius,
BRUTUS:
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
BRUTUS:
And we will follow.
CLAUDIUS:
It shall be done, my lord.
CLAUDIUS:
Exeunt
CLAUDIUS:
ACT V
CLAUDIUS:
SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.
CLAUDIUS:
Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army
OCTAVIUS:
Now, Antony, our hopes are answered
OCTAVIUS:
You said the enemy would not come down,
OCTAVIUS:
But keep the hills and upper regions,
OCTAVIUS:
It proves not so: their battles are at hand,
OCTAVIUS:
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
OCTAVIUS:
Answering before we do demand of them.
ANTONY:
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
ANTONY:
Wherefore they do it: they could be content
ANTONY:
To visit other places, and come down
ANTONY:
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
ANTONY:
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage,
ANTONY:
But 'tis not so.
ANTONY:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Prepare you, generals
Messenger:
The enemy comes on in gallant show,
Messenger:
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
Messenger:
And something to be done immediately.
ANTONY:
Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
ANTONY:
Upon the left hand of the even field.
OCTAVIUS:
Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
ANTONY:
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
OCTAVIUS:
I do not cross you, but I will do so.
OCTAVIUS:
March
OCTAVIUS:
Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army, LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others
BRUTUS:
They stand, and would have parley.
CASSIUS:
Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.
OCTAVIUS:
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
ANTONY:
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
ANTONY:
Make forth, the generals would have some words.
OCTAVIUS:
Stir not until the signal.
BRUTUS:
Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?
OCTAVIUS:
Not that we love words better, as you do.
BRUTUS:
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
ANTONY:
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words
ANTONY:
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
ANTONY:
Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'
CASSIUS:
Antony,
CASSIUS:
The posture of your blows are yet unknown,
CASSIUS:
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
CASSIUS:
And leave them honeyless.
ANTONY:
Not stingless too.
BRUTUS:
O, yes, and soundless too,
BRUTUS:
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
BRUTUS:
And very wisely threat before you sting.
ANTONY:
Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
ANTONY:
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar
ANTONY:
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
ANTONY:
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet,
ANTONY:
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
ANTONY:
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
CASSIUS:
Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself
CASSIUS:
This tongue had not offended so to-day,
CASSIUS:
If Cassius might have ruled.
OCTAVIUS:
Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
OCTAVIUS:
The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look,
OCTAVIUS:
I draw a sword against conspirators,
OCTAVIUS:
When think you that the sword goes up again?
OCTAVIUS:
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
OCTAVIUS:
Be well avenged, or till another Caesar
OCTAVIUS:
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
BRUTUS:
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
BRUTUS:
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
OCTAVIUS:
So I hope,
OCTAVIUS:
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
BRUTUS:
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
BRUTUS:
Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.
CASSIUS:
A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
CASSIUS:
Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
ANTONY:
Old Cassius still!
OCTAVIUS:
Come, Antony, away!
OCTAVIUS:
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth
OCTAVIUS:
If you dare fight to-day, come to the field,
OCTAVIUS:
If not, when you have stomachs.
OCTAVIUS:
Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army
CASSIUS:
Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
CASSIUS:
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
BRUTUS:
Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.
LUCILIUS:
[Standing forth]	My lord?
LUCILIUS:
BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart
CASSIUS:
Messala!
MESSALA:
[Standing forth]  What says my general?
CASSIUS:
Messala,
CASSIUS:
This is my birth-day, as this very day
CASSIUS:
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala
CASSIUS:
Be thou my witness that against my will,
CASSIUS:
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
CASSIUS:
Upon one battle all our liberties.
CASSIUS:
You know that I held Epicurus strong
CASSIUS:
And his opinion: now I change my mind,
CASSIUS:
And partly credit things that do presage.
CASSIUS:
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
CASSIUS:
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
CASSIUS:
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,
CASSIUS:
Who to Philippi here consorted us
CASSIUS:
This morning are they fled away and gone,
CASSIUS:
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
CASSIUS:
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
CASSIUS:
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
CASSIUS:
A canopy most fatal, under which
CASSIUS:
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
MESSALA:
Believe not so.
CASSIUS:
I but believe it partly,
CASSIUS:
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
CASSIUS:
To meet all perils very constantly.
BRUTUS:
Even so, Lucilius.
CASSIUS:
Now, most noble Brutus,
CASSIUS:
The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
CASSIUS:
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
CASSIUS:
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
CASSIUS:
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
CASSIUS:
If we do lose this battle, then is this
CASSIUS:
The very last time we shall speak together
CASSIUS:
What are you then determined to do?
BRUTUS:
Even by the rule of that philosophy
BRUTUS:
By which I did blame Cato for the death
BRUTUS:
Which he did give himself, I know not how,
BRUTUS:
But I do find it cowardly and vile,
BRUTUS:
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
BRUTUS:
The time of life: arming myself with patience
BRUTUS:
To stay the providence of some high powers
BRUTUS:
That govern us below.
CASSIUS:
Then, if we lose this battle,
CASSIUS:
You are contented to be led in triumph
CASSIUS:
Thorough the streets of Rome?
BRUTUS:
No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
BRUTUS:
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome,
BRUTUS:
He bears too great a mind. But this same day
BRUTUS:
Must end that work the ides of March begun,
BRUTUS:
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
BRUTUS:
Therefore our everlasting farewell take
BRUTUS:
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
BRUTUS:
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile,
BRUTUS:
If not, why then, this parting was well made.
CASSIUS:
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
CASSIUS:
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed,
CASSIUS:
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
BRUTUS:
Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
BRUTUS:
The end of this day's business ere it come!
BRUTUS:
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
BRUTUS:
And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!
BRUTUS:
Exeunt
BRUTUS:
SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.
BRUTUS:
Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA
BRUTUS:
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
BRUTUS:
Unto the legions on the other side.
BRUTUS:
Loud alarum
BRUTUS:
Let them set on at once, for I perceive
BRUTUS:
But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
BRUTUS:
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
BRUTUS:
Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt
BRUTUS:
SCENE III. Another part of the field.
BRUTUS:
Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS
CASSIUS:
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
CASSIUS:
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy
CASSIUS:
This ensign here of mine was turning back,
CASSIUS:
I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
TITINIUS:
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
TITINIUS:
Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
TITINIUS:
Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
TITINIUS:
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
TITINIUS:
Enter PINDARUS
PINDARUS:
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off,
PINDARUS:
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
PINDARUS:
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
CASSIUS:
This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius,
CASSIUS:
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
TITINIUS:
They are, my lord.
CASSIUS:
Titinius, if thou lovest me,
CASSIUS:
Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
CASSIUS:
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
CASSIUS:
And here again, that I may rest assured
CASSIUS:
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
TITINIUS:
I will be here again, even with a thought.
TITINIUS:
Exit
CASSIUS:
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill,
CASSIUS:
My sight was ever thick, regard Titinius,
CASSIUS:
And tell me what thou notest about the field.
CASSIUS:
PINDARUS ascends the hill
CASSIUS:
This day I breathed first: time is come round,
CASSIUS:
And where I did begin, there shall I end,
CASSIUS:
My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?
PINDARUS:
[Above]  O my lord!
CASSIUS:
What news?
PINDARUS:
[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round about
PINDARUS:
With horsemen, that make to him on the spur,
PINDARUS:
Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
PINDARUS:
Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
PINDARUS:
He's ta'en.
PINDARUS:
Shout
PINDARUS:
And, hark! they shout for joy.
CASSIUS:
Come down, behold no more.
CASSIUS:
O, coward that I am, to live so long,
CASSIUS:
To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
CASSIUS:
PINDARUS descends
CASSIUS:
Come hither, sirrah
CASSIUS:
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,
CASSIUS:
And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
CASSIUS:
That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
CASSIUS:
Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath,
CASSIUS:
Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
CASSIUS:
That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
CASSIUS:
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts,
CASSIUS:
And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
CASSIUS:
Guide thou the sword.
CASSIUS:
PINDARUS stabs him
CASSIUS:
Caesar, thou art revenged,
CASSIUS:
Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
CASSIUS:
Dies
PINDARUS:
So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
PINDARUS:
Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
PINDARUS:
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
PINDARUS:
Where never Roman shall take note of him.
PINDARUS:
Exit
PINDARUS:
Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA
MESSALA:
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
MESSALA:
Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
MESSALA:
As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
TITINIUS:
These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
MESSALA:
Where did you leave him?
TITINIUS:
All disconsolate,
TITINIUS:
With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
MESSALA:
Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?
TITINIUS:
He lies not like the living. O my heart!
MESSALA:
Is not that he?
TITINIUS:
No, this was he, Messala,
TITINIUS:
But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
TITINIUS:
As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
TITINIUS:
So in his red blood Cassius' day is set,
TITINIUS:
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone,
TITINIUS:
Clouds, dews, and dangers come, our deeds are done!
TITINIUS:
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
MESSALA:
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
MESSALA:
O hateful error, melancholy's child,
MESSALA:
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
MESSALA:
The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
MESSALA:
Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
MESSALA:
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
TITINIUS:
What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?
MESSALA:
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
MESSALA:
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
MESSALA:
Into his ears, I may say, thrusting it,
MESSALA:
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
MESSALA:
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
MESSALA:
As tidings of this sight.
TITINIUS:
Hie you, Messala,
TITINIUS:
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
TITINIUS:
Exit MESSALA
TITINIUS:
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
TITINIUS:
Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
TITINIUS:
Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
TITINIUS:
And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
TITINIUS:
Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
TITINIUS:
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow,
TITINIUS:
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
TITINIUS:
Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
TITINIUS:
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
TITINIUS:
By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part
TITINIUS:
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
TITINIUS:
Kills himself
TITINIUS:
Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS
BRUTUS:
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
MESSALA:
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
BRUTUS:
Titinius' face is upward.
CATO:
He is slain.
BRUTUS:
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
BRUTUS:
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
BRUTUS:
In our own proper entrails.
BRUTUS:
Low alarums
CATO:
Brave Titinius!
CATO:
Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
BRUTUS:
Are yet two Romans living such as these?
BRUTUS:
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
BRUTUS:
It is impossible that ever Rome
BRUTUS:
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
BRUTUS:
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
BRUTUS:
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
BRUTUS:
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body
BRUTUS:
His funerals shall not be in our camp,
BRUTUS:
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come,
BRUTUS:
And come, young Cato, let us to the field.
BRUTUS:
Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on
BRUTUS:
'Tis three o'clock, and, Romans, yet ere night
BRUTUS:
We shall try fortune in a second fight.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt
BRUTUS:
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
BRUTUS:
Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies, then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others
BRUTUS:
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
CATO:
What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
CATO:
I will proclaim my name about the field
CATO:
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
CATO:
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend,
CATO:
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
BRUTUS:
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I,
BRUTUS:
Brutus, my country's friend, know me for Brutus!
BRUTUS:
Exit
LUCILIUS:
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
LUCILIUS:
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,
LUCILIUS:
And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.
First Soldier:
Yield, or thou diest.
LUCILIUS:
Only I yield to die
LUCILIUS:
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight,
LUCILIUS:
Offering money
LUCILIUS:
Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
First Soldier:
We must not. A noble prisoner!
Second Soldier:
Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
First Soldier:
I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
First Soldier:
Enter ANTONY
First Soldier:
Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
ANTONY:
Where is he?
LUCILIUS:
Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough
LUCILIUS:
I dare assure thee that no enemy
LUCILIUS:
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus
LUCILIUS:
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
LUCILIUS:
When you do find him, or alive or dead,
LUCILIUS:
He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
ANTONY:
This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
ANTONY:
A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe,
ANTONY:
Give him all kindness: I had rather have
ANTONY:
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
ANTONY:
And see whether Brutus be alive or dead,
ANTONY:
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
ANTONY:
How every thing is chanced.
ANTONY:
Exeunt
ANTONY:
SCENE V. Another part of the field.
ANTONY:
Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS
BRUTUS:
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
CLITUS:
Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
CLITUS:
He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.
BRUTUS:
Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word,
BRUTUS:
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
BRUTUS:
Whispers
CLITUS:
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
BRUTUS:
Peace then! no words.
CLITUS:
I'll rather kill myself.
BRUTUS:
Hark thee, Dardanius.
BRUTUS:
Whispers
DARDANIUS:
Shall I do such a deed?
CLITUS:
O Dardanius!
DARDANIUS:
O Clitus!
CLITUS:
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
DARDANIUS:
To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
CLITUS:
Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
CLITUS:
That it runs over even at his eyes.
BRUTUS:
Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
VOLUMNIUS:
What says my lord?
BRUTUS:
Why, this, Volumnius
BRUTUS:
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
BRUTUS:
Two several times by night, at Sardis once,
BRUTUS:
And, this last night, here in Philippi fields
BRUTUS:
I know my hour is come.
VOLUMNIUS:
Not so, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
BRUTUS:
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes,
BRUTUS:
Our enemies have beat us to the pit
BRUTUS:
Low alarums
BRUTUS:
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
BRUTUS:
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
BRUTUS:
Thou know'st that we two went to school together
BRUTUS:
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
BRUTUS:
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
VOLUMNIUS:
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
VOLUMNIUS:
Alarum still
CLITUS:
Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
BRUTUS:
Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
BRUTUS:
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep,
BRUTUS:
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
BRUTUS:
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
BRUTUS:
I found no man but he was true to me.
BRUTUS:
I shall have glory by this losing day
BRUTUS:
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
BRUTUS:
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
BRUTUS:
So fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue
BRUTUS:
Hath almost ended his life's history
BRUTUS:
Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest,
BRUTUS:
That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
BRUTUS:
Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'
CLITUS:
Fly, my lord, fly.
BRUTUS:
Hence! I will follow.
BRUTUS:
Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS
BRUTUS:
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord
BRUTUS:
Thou art a fellow of a good respect,
BRUTUS:
Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it
BRUTUS:
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
BRUTUS:
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
STRATO:
Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Farewell, good Strato.
BRUTUS:
Runs on his sword
BRUTUS:
Caesar, now be still
BRUTUS:
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
BRUTUS:
Dies
BRUTUS:
Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, LUCILIUS, and the army
OCTAVIUS:
What man is that?
MESSALA:
My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
STRATO:
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala
STRATO:
The conquerors can but make a fire of him,
STRATO:
For Brutus only overcame himself,
STRATO:
And no man else hath honour by his death.
LUCILIUS:
So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
LUCILIUS:
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
OCTAVIUS:
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
OCTAVIUS:
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
STRATO:
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
OCTAVIUS:
Do so, good Messala.
MESSALA:
How died my master, Strato?
STRATO:
I held the sword, and he did run on it.
MESSALA:
Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
MESSALA:
That did the latest service to my master.
ANTONY:
This was the noblest Roman of them all
ANTONY:
All the conspirators save only he
ANTONY:
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar,
ANTONY:
He only, in a general honest thought
ANTONY:
And common good to all, made one of them.
ANTONY:
His life was gentle, and the elements
ANTONY:
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
ANTONY:
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
OCTAVIUS:
According to his virtue let us use him,
OCTAVIUS:
With all respect and rites of burial.
OCTAVIUS:
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
OCTAVIUS:
Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
OCTAVIUS:
So call the field to rest, and let's away,
OCTAVIUS:
To part the glories of this happy day.
OCTAVIUS:
Exeunt
