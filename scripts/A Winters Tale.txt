VALENTINE:
ACT I
VALENTINE:
SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.
VALENTINE:
Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS
ARCHIDAMUS:
If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
ARCHIDAMUS:
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
ARCHIDAMUS:
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
ARCHIDAMUS:
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
CAMILLO:
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
CAMILLO:
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
ARCHIDAMUS:
justified in our loves, for indeed--
CAMILLO:
Beseech you,--
ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge
ARCHIDAMUS:
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
ARCHIDAMUS:
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
ARCHIDAMUS:
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
ARCHIDAMUS:
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
ARCHIDAMUS:
us.
CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
ARCHIDAMUS:
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
CAMILLO:
They were trained together in their childhoods, and
CAMILLO:
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
CAMILLO:
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
CAMILLO:
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
CAMILLO:
separation of their society, their encounters,
CAMILLO:
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
CAMILLO:
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
CAMILLO:
embassies, that they have seemed to be together,
CAMILLO:
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
CAMILLO:
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
CAMILLO:
winds. The heavens continue their loves!
ARCHIDAMUS:
I think there is not in the world either malice or
ARCHIDAMUS:
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
ARCHIDAMUS:
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
ARCHIDAMUS:
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
ARCHIDAMUS:
into my note.
CAMILLO:
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
CAMILLO:
is a gallant child, one that indeed physics the
CAMILLO:
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
CAMILLO:
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
CAMILLO:
see him a man.
ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they else be content to die?
CAMILLO:
Yes, if there were no other excuse why they should
CAMILLO:
desire to live.
ARCHIDAMUS:
If the king had no son, they would desire to live
ARCHIDAMUS:
on crutches till he had one.
ARCHIDAMUS:
Exeunt
ARCHIDAMUS:
SCENE II. A room of state in the same.
ARCHIDAMUS:
Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants
POLIXENES:
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
POLIXENES:
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
POLIXENES:
Without a burthen: time as long again
POLIXENES:
Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks,
POLIXENES:
And yet we should, for perpetuity,
POLIXENES:
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
POLIXENES:
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
POLIXENES:
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
POLIXENES:
That go before it.
LEONTES:
Stay your thanks a while,
LEONTES:
And pay them when you part.
POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
POLIXENES:
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
POLIXENES:
Or breed upon our absence, that may blow
POLIXENES:
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
POLIXENES:
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
POLIXENES:
To tire your royalty.
LEONTES:
We are tougher, brother,
LEONTES:
Than you can put us to't.
POLIXENES:
No longer stay.
LEONTES:
One seven-night longer.
POLIXENES:
Very sooth, to-morrow.
LEONTES:
We'll part the time between's then, and in that
LEONTES:
I'll no gainsaying.
POLIXENES:
Press me not, beseech you, so.
POLIXENES:
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
POLIXENES:
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
POLIXENES:
Were there necessity in your request, although
POLIXENES:
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
POLIXENES:
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
POLIXENES:
Were in your love a whip to me, my stay
POLIXENES:
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
POLIXENES:
Farewell, our brother.
LEONTES:
Tongue-tied, our queen?
LEONTES:
speak you.
HERMIONE:
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
HERMIONE:
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
HERMIONE:
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
HERMIONE:
All in Bohemia's well, this satisfaction
HERMIONE:
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
HERMIONE:
He's beat from his best ward.
LEONTES:
Well said, Hermione.
HERMIONE:
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong
HERMIONE:
But let him say so then, and let him go,
HERMIONE:
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
HERMIONE:
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
HERMIONE:
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
HERMIONE:
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
HERMIONE:
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
HERMIONE:
To let him there a month behind the gest
HERMIONE:
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
HERMIONE:
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
HERMIONE:
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
POLIXENES:
No, madam.
HERMIONE:
Nay, but you will?
POLIXENES:
I may not, verily.
HERMIONE:
Verily!
HERMIONE:
You put me off with limber vows, but I,
HERMIONE:
Though you would seek to unsphere the
HERMIONE:
stars with oaths,
HERMIONE:
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
HERMIONE:
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
HERMIONE:
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
HERMIONE:
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
HERMIONE:
Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees
HERMIONE:
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
HERMIONE:
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
HERMIONE:
One of them you shall be.
POLIXENES:
Your guest, then, madam
POLIXENES:
To be your prisoner should import offending,
POLIXENES:
Which is for me less easy to commit
POLIXENES:
Than you to punish.
HERMIONE:
Not your gaoler, then,
HERMIONE:
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
HERMIONE:
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys
HERMIONE:
You were pretty lordings then?
POLIXENES:
We were, fair queen,
POLIXENES:
Two lads that thought there was no more behind
POLIXENES:
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
POLIXENES:
And to be boy eternal.
HERMIONE:
Was not my lord
HERMIONE:
The verier wag o' the two?
POLIXENES:
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
POLIXENES:
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
POLIXENES:
Was innocence for innocence, we knew not
POLIXENES:
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
POLIXENES:
That any did. Had we pursued that life,
POLIXENES:
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
POLIXENES:
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
POLIXENES:
Boldly 'not guilty,' the imposition clear'd
POLIXENES:
Hereditary ours.
HERMIONE:
By this we gather
HERMIONE:
You have tripp'd since.
POLIXENES:
O my most sacred lady!
POLIXENES:
Temptations have since then been born to's, for
POLIXENES:
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl,
POLIXENES:
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
POLIXENES:
Of my young play-fellow.
HERMIONE:
Grace to boot!
HERMIONE:
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
HERMIONE:
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on,
HERMIONE:
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
HERMIONE:
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
HERMIONE:
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
HERMIONE:
With any but with us.
LEONTES:
Is he won yet?
HERMIONE:
He'll stay my lord.
LEONTES:
At my request he would not.
LEONTES:
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
LEONTES:
To better purpose.
HERMIONE:
Never?
LEONTES:
Never, but once.
HERMIONE:
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
HERMIONE:
I prithee tell me, cram's with praise, and make's
HERMIONE:
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
HERMIONE:
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
HERMIONE:
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
HERMIONE:
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
HERMIONE:
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal
HERMIONE:
My last good deed was to entreat his stay
HERMIONE:
What was my first? it has an elder sister,
HERMIONE:
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
HERMIONE:
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
HERMIONE:
Nay, let me have't, I long.
LEONTES:
Why, that was when
LEONTES:
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
LEONTES:
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
LEONTES:
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
LEONTES:
'I am yours for ever.'
HERMIONE:
'Tis grace indeed.
HERMIONE:
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice
HERMIONE:
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband,
HERMIONE:
The other for some while a friend.
LEONTES:
[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!
LEONTES:
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
LEONTES:
I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances,
LEONTES:
But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment
LEONTES:
May a free face put on, derive a liberty
LEONTES:
From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
LEONTES:
And well become the agent, 't may, I grant,
LEONTES:
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
LEONTES:
As now they are, and making practised smiles,
LEONTES:
As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
LEONTES:
The mort o' the deer, O, that is entertainment
LEONTES:
My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
LEONTES:
Art thou my boy?
MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord.
LEONTES:
I' fecks!
LEONTES:
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
LEONTES:
smutch'd thy nose?
LEONTES:
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
LEONTES:
We must be neat, not neat, but cleanly, captain
LEONTES:
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
LEONTES:
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
LEONTES:
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
LEONTES:
Art thou my calf?
MAMILLIUS:
Yes, if you will, my lord.
LEONTES:
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
LEONTES:
To be full like me: yet they say we are
LEONTES:
Almost as like as eggs, women say so,
LEONTES:
That will say anything but were they false
LEONTES:
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
LEONTES:
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
LEONTES:
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
LEONTES:
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
LEONTES:
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
LEONTES:
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
LEONTES:
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre
LEONTES:
Thou dost make possible things not so held,
LEONTES:
Communicatest with dreams,--how can this be?--
LEONTES:
With what's unreal thou coactive art,
LEONTES:
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
LEONTES:
Thou mayst co-join with something, and thou dost,
LEONTES:
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
LEONTES:
And that to the infection of my brains
LEONTES:
And hardening of my brows.
POLIXENES:
What means Sicilia?
HERMIONE:
He something seems unsettled.
POLIXENES:
How, my lord!
POLIXENES:
What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?
HERMIONE:
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
HERMIONE:
Are you moved, my lord?
LEONTES:
No, in good earnest.
LEONTES:
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
LEONTES:
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
LEONTES:
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
LEONTES:
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
LEONTES:
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
LEONTES:
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
LEONTES:
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
LEONTES:
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous
LEONTES:
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
LEONTES:
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
LEONTES:
Will you take eggs for money?
MAMILLIUS:
No, my lord, I'll fight.
LEONTES:
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
LEONTES:
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
LEONTES:
Do seem to be of ours?
POLIXENES:
If at home, sir,
POLIXENES:
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
POLIXENES:
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
POLIXENES:
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all
POLIXENES:
He makes a July's day short as December,
POLIXENES:
And with his varying childness cures in me
POLIXENES:
Thoughts that would thick my blood.
LEONTES:
So stands this squire
LEONTES:
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
LEONTES:
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
LEONTES:
How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome,
LEONTES:
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap
LEONTES:
Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
LEONTES:
Apparent to my heart.
HERMIONE:
If you would seek us,
HERMIONE:
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
LEONTES:
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
LEONTES:
Be you beneath the sky.
LEONTES:
Aside
LEONTES:
I am angling now,
LEONTES:
Though you perceive me not how I give line.
LEONTES:
Go to, go to!
LEONTES:
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
LEONTES:
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
LEONTES:
To her allowing husband!
LEONTES:
Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants
LEONTES:
Gone already!
LEONTES:
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
LEONTES:
ears a fork'd one!
LEONTES:
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
LEONTES:
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
LEONTES:
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
LEONTES:
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
LEONTES:
There have been,
LEONTES:
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now,
LEONTES:
And many a man there is, even at this present,
LEONTES:
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
LEONTES:
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
LEONTES:
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
LEONTES:
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
LEONTES:
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
LEONTES:
As mine, against their will. Should all despair
LEONTES:
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
LEONTES:
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none,
LEONTES:
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
LEONTES:
Where 'tis predominant, and 'tis powerful, think it,
LEONTES:
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
LEONTES:
No barricado for a belly, know't,
LEONTES:
It will let in and out the enemy
LEONTES:
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
LEONTES:
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
MAMILLIUS:
I am like you, they say.
LEONTES:
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
CAMILLO:
Ay, my good lord.
LEONTES:
Go play, Mamillius, thou'rt an honest man.
LEONTES:
Exit MAMILLIUS
LEONTES:
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
CAMILLO:
You had much ado to make his anchor hold
CAMILLO:
When you cast out, it still came home.
LEONTES:
Didst note it?
CAMILLO:
He would not stay at your petitions: made
CAMILLO:
His business more material.
LEONTES:
Didst perceive it?
LEONTES:
Aside
LEONTES:
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
LEONTES:
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
LEONTES:
When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
LEONTES:
That he did stay?
CAMILLO:
At the good queen's entreaty.
LEONTES:
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
LEONTES:
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
LEONTES:
By any understanding pate but thine?
LEONTES:
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
LEONTES:
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
LEONTES:
But of the finer natures? by some severals
LEONTES:
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
LEONTES:
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
CAMILLO:
Business, my lord! I think most understand
CAMILLO:
Bohemia stays here longer.
LEONTES:
Ha!
CAMILLO:
Stays here longer.
LEONTES:
Ay, but why?
CAMILLO:
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
CAMILLO:
Of our most gracious mistress.
LEONTES:
Satisfy!
LEONTES:
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
LEONTES:
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
LEONTES:
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
LEONTES:
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
LEONTES:
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
LEONTES:
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
LEONTES:
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
LEONTES:
In that which seems so.
CAMILLO:
Be it forbid, my lord!
LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
LEONTES:
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
LEONTES:
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
LEONTES:
From course required, or else thou must be counted
LEONTES:
A servant grafted in my serious trust
LEONTES:
And therein negligent, or else a fool
LEONTES:
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
LEONTES:
And takest it all for jest.
CAMILLO:
My gracious lord,
CAMILLO:
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful,
CAMILLO:
In every one of these no man is free,
CAMILLO:
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
CAMILLO:
Among the infinite doings of the world,
CAMILLO:
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
CAMILLO:
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
CAMILLO:
It was my folly, if industriously
CAMILLO:
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
CAMILLO:
Not weighing well the end, if ever fearful
CAMILLO:
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
CAMILLO:
Where of the execution did cry out
CAMILLO:
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
CAMILLO:
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
CAMILLO:
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
CAMILLO:
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
CAMILLO:
Be plainer with me, let me know my trespass
CAMILLO:
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
CAMILLO:
'Tis none of mine.
LEONTES:
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
LEONTES:
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
LEONTES:
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
LEONTES:
For to a vision so apparent rumour
LEONTES:
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
LEONTES:
Resides not in that man that does not think,--
LEONTES:
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
LEONTES:
Or else be impudently negative,
LEONTES:
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
LEONTES:
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
LEONTES:
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
LEONTES:
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
CAMILLO:
I would not be a stander-by to hear
CAMILLO:
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
CAMILLO:
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
CAMILLO:
You never spoke what did become you less
CAMILLO:
Than this, which to reiterate were sin
CAMILLO:
As deep as that, though true.
LEONTES:
Is whispering nothing?
LEONTES:
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
LEONTES:
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
LEONTES:
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
LEONTES:
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
LEONTES:
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
LEONTES:
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
LEONTES:
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
LEONTES:
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
LEONTES:
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing,
LEONTES:
The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,
LEONTES:
My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,
LEONTES:
If this be nothing.
CAMILLO:
Good my lord, be cured
CAMILLO:
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes,
CAMILLO:
For 'tis most dangerous.
LEONTES:
Say it be, 'tis true.
CAMILLO:
No, no, my lord.
LEONTES:
It is, you lie, you lie
LEONTES:
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
LEONTES:
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
LEONTES:
Or else a hovering temporizer, that
LEONTES:
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
LEONTES:
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
LEONTES:
Infected as her life, she would not live
LEONTES:
The running of one glass.
CAMILLO:
Who does infect her?
LEONTES:
Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
LEONTES:
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
LEONTES:
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
LEONTES:
To see alike mine honour as their profits,
LEONTES:
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
LEONTES:
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
LEONTES:
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
LEONTES:
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
LEONTES:
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
LEONTES:
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
LEONTES:
To give mine enemy a lasting wink,
LEONTES:
Which draught to me were cordial.
CAMILLO:
Sir, my lord,
CAMILLO:
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
CAMILLO:
But with a lingering dram that should not work
CAMILLO:
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
CAMILLO:
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
CAMILLO:
So sovereignly being honourable.
CAMILLO:
I have loved thee,--
LEONTES:
Make that thy question, and go rot!
LEONTES:
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
LEONTES:
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
LEONTES:
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
LEONTES:
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
LEONTES:
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
LEONTES:
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
LEONTES:
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
LEONTES:
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
LEONTES:
Could man so blench?
CAMILLO:
I must believe you, sir
CAMILLO:
I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for't,
CAMILLO:
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
CAMILLO:
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
CAMILLO:
Even for your son's sake, and thereby for sealing
CAMILLO:
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
CAMILLO:
Known and allied to yours.
LEONTES:
Thou dost advise me
LEONTES:
Even so as I mine own course have set down
LEONTES:
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
CAMILLO:
My lord,
CAMILLO:
Go then, and with a countenance as clear
CAMILLO:
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
CAMILLO:
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer
CAMILLO:
If from me he have wholesome beverage,
CAMILLO:
Account me not your servant.
LEONTES:
This is all
LEONTES:
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart,
LEONTES:
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.
CAMILLO:
I'll do't, my lord.
LEONTES:
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
LEONTES:
Exit
CAMILLO:
O miserable lady! But, for me,
CAMILLO:
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
CAMILLO:
Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do't
CAMILLO:
Is the obedience to a master, one
CAMILLO:
Who in rebellion with himself will have
CAMILLO:
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
CAMILLO:
Promotion follows. If I could find example
CAMILLO:
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
CAMILLO:
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't, but since
CAMILLO:
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
CAMILLO:
Let villany itself forswear't. I must
CAMILLO:
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
CAMILLO:
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
CAMILLO:
Here comes Bohemia.
CAMILLO:
Re-enter POLIXENES
POLIXENES:
This is strange: methinks
POLIXENES:
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
POLIXENES:
Good day, Camillo.
CAMILLO:
Hail, most royal sir!
POLIXENES:
What is the news i' the court?
CAMILLO:
None rare, my lord.
POLIXENES:
The king hath on him such a countenance
POLIXENES:
As he had lost some province and a region
POLIXENES:
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
POLIXENES:
With customary compliment, when he,
POLIXENES:
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
POLIXENES:
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
POLIXENES:
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
POLIXENES:
That changeth thus his manners.
CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord.
POLIXENES:
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
POLIXENES:
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts,
POLIXENES:
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
POLIXENES:
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
POLIXENES:
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
POLIXENES:
Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be
POLIXENES:
A party in this alteration, finding
POLIXENES:
Myself thus alter'd with 't.
CAMILLO:
There is a sickness
CAMILLO:
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
CAMILLO:
I cannot name the disease, and it is caught
CAMILLO:
Of you that yet are well.
POLIXENES:
How! caught of me!
POLIXENES:
Make me not sighted like the basilisk
POLIXENES:
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
POLIXENES:
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
POLIXENES:
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
POLIXENES:
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
POLIXENES:
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
POLIXENES:
In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
POLIXENES:
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
POLIXENES:
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
POLIXENES:
In ignorant concealment.
CAMILLO:
I may not answer.
POLIXENES:
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
POLIXENES:
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
POLIXENES:
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
POLIXENES:
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
POLIXENES:
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
POLIXENES:
What incidency thou dost guess of harm
POLIXENES:
Is creeping toward me, how far off, how near,
POLIXENES:
Which way to be prevented, if to be,
POLIXENES:
If not, how best to bear it.
CAMILLO:
Sir, I will tell you,
CAMILLO:
Since I am charged in honour and by him
CAMILLO:
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
CAMILLO:
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
CAMILLO:
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
CAMILLO:
Cry lost, and so good night!
POLIXENES:
On, good Camillo.
CAMILLO:
I am appointed him to murder you.
POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?
CAMILLO:
By the king.
POLIXENES:
For what?
CAMILLO:
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
CAMILLO:
As he had seen't or been an instrument
CAMILLO:
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
CAMILLO:
Forbiddenly.
POLIXENES:
O, then my best blood turn
POLIXENES:
To an infected jelly and my name
POLIXENES:
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
POLIXENES:
Turn then my freshest reputation to
POLIXENES:
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
POLIXENES:
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
POLIXENES:
Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
POLIXENES:
That e'er was heard or read!
CAMILLO:
Swear his thought over
CAMILLO:
By each particular star in heaven and
CAMILLO:
By all their influences, you may as well
CAMILLO:
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
CAMILLO:
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
CAMILLO:
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
CAMILLO:
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
CAMILLO:
The standing of his body.
POLIXENES:
How should this grow?
CAMILLO:
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
CAMILLO:
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
CAMILLO:
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
CAMILLO:
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
CAMILLO:
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
CAMILLO:
Your followers I will whisper to the business,
CAMILLO:
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
CAMILLO:
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
CAMILLO:
My fortunes to your service, which are here
CAMILLO:
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,
CAMILLO:
For, by the honour of my parents, I
CAMILLO:
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
CAMILLO:
I dare not stand by, nor shall you be safer
CAMILLO:
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
CAMILLO:
His execution sworn.
POLIXENES:
I do believe thee
POLIXENES:
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand
POLIXENES:
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
POLIXENES:
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
POLIXENES:
My people did expect my hence departure
POLIXENES:
Two days ago. This jealousy
POLIXENES:
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
POLIXENES:
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
POLIXENES:
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
POLIXENES:
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
POLIXENES:
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
POLIXENES:
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me
POLIXENES:
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
POLIXENES:
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
POLIXENES:
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo,
POLIXENES:
I will respect thee as a father if
POLIXENES:
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
CAMILLO:
It is in mine authority to command
CAMILLO:
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
CAMILLO:
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.
CAMILLO:
Exeunt
CAMILLO:
ACT II
CAMILLO:
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
CAMILLO:
Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies
HERMIONE:
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
HERMIONE:
'Tis past enduring.
First Lady:
Come, my gracious lord,
First Lady:
Shall I be your playfellow?
MAMILLIUS:
No, I'll none of you.
First Lady:
Why, my sweet lord?
MAMILLIUS:
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
MAMILLIUS:
I were a baby still. I love you better.
Second Lady:
And why so, my lord?
MAMILLIUS:
Not for because
MAMILLIUS:
Your brows are blacker, yet black brows, they say,
MAMILLIUS:
Become some women best, so that there be not
MAMILLIUS:
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
MAMILLIUS:
Or a half-moon made with a pen.
Second Lady:
Who taught you this?
MAMILLIUS:
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
MAMILLIUS:
What colour are your eyebrows?
First Lady:
Blue, my lord.
MAMILLIUS:
Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
MAMILLIUS:
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
First Lady:
Hark ye,
First Lady:
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
First Lady:
Present our services to a fine new prince
First Lady:
One of these days, and then you'ld wanton with us,
First Lady:
If we would have you.
Second Lady:
She is spread of late
Second Lady:
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
HERMIONE:
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
HERMIONE:
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
HERMIONE:
And tell 's a tale.
MAMILLIUS:
Merry or sad shall't be?
HERMIONE:
As merry as you will.
MAMILLIUS:
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
MAMILLIUS:
Of sprites and goblins.
HERMIONE:
Let's have that, good sir.
HERMIONE:
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
HERMIONE:
To fright me with your sprites, you're powerful at it.
MAMILLIUS:
There was a man--
HERMIONE:
Nay, come, sit down, then on.
MAMILLIUS:
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly,
MAMILLIUS:
Yond crickets shall not hear it.
HERMIONE:
Come on, then,
HERMIONE:
And give't me in mine ear.
HERMIONE:
Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others
LEONTES:
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
First Lord:
Behind the tuft of pines I met them, never
First Lord:
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
First Lord:
Even to their ships.
LEONTES:
How blest am I
LEONTES:
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
LEONTES:
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
LEONTES:
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
LEONTES:
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
LEONTES:
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
LEONTES:
Is not infected: but if one present
LEONTES:
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
LEONTES:
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
LEONTES:
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
LEONTES:
and seen the spider.
LEONTES:
Camillo was his help in this, his pander
LEONTES:
There is a plot against my life, my crown,
LEONTES:
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
LEONTES:
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him
LEONTES:
He has discover'd my design, and I
LEONTES:
Remain a pinch'd thing, yea, a very trick
LEONTES:
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
LEONTES:
So easily open?
First Lord:
By his great authority,
First Lord:
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
First Lord:
On your command.
LEONTES:
I know't too well.
LEONTES:
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him
LEONTES:
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
LEONTES:
Have too much blood in him.
HERMIONE:
What is this? sport?
LEONTES:
Bear the boy hence, he shall not come about her,
LEONTES:
Away with him! and let her sport herself
LEONTES:
With that she's big with, for 'tis Polixenes
LEONTES:
Has made thee swell thus.
HERMIONE:
But I'ld say he had not,
HERMIONE:
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
HERMIONE:
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
LEONTES:
You, my lords,
LEONTES:
Look on her, mark her well, be but about
LEONTES:
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
LEONTES:
The justice of your bearts will thereto add
LEONTES:
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
LEONTES:
Praise her but for this her without-door form,
LEONTES:
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
LEONTES:
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
LEONTES:
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
LEONTES:
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
LEONTES:
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
LEONTES:
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
LEONTES:
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
LEONTES:
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
LEONTES:
She's an adulteress.
HERMIONE:
Should a villain say so,
HERMIONE:
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
HERMIONE:
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
HERMIONE:
Do but mistake.
LEONTES:
You have mistook, my lady,
LEONTES:
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
LEONTES:
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
LEONTES:
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
LEONTES:
Should a like language use to all degrees
LEONTES:
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
LEONTES:
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
LEONTES:
She's an adulteress, I have said with whom
LEONTES:
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
LEONTES:
A federary with her, and one that knows
LEONTES:
What she should shame to know herself
LEONTES:
But with her most vile principal, that she's
LEONTES:
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
LEONTES:
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
LEONTES:
To this their late escape.
HERMIONE:
No, by my life.
HERMIONE:
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
HERMIONE:
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
HERMIONE:
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
HERMIONE:
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
HERMIONE:
You did mistake.
LEONTES:
No, if I mistake
LEONTES:
In those foundations which I build upon,
LEONTES:
The centre is not big enough to bear
LEONTES:
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
LEONTES:
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
LEONTES:
But that he speaks.
HERMIONE:
There's some ill planet reigns
HERMIONE:
I must be patient till the heavens look
HERMIONE:
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
HERMIONE:
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
HERMIONE:
Commonly are, the want of which vain dew
HERMIONE:
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
HERMIONE:
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
HERMIONE:
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
HERMIONE:
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
HERMIONE:
Shall best instruct you, measure me, and so
HERMIONE:
The king's will be perform'd!
LEONTES:
Shall I be heard?
HERMIONE:
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
HERMIONE:
My women may be with me, for you see
HERMIONE:
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools,
HERMIONE:
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
HERMIONE:
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
HERMIONE:
As I come out: this action I now go on
HERMIONE:
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord
HERMIONE:
I never wish'd to see you sorry, now
HERMIONE:
I trust I shall. My women, come, you have leave.
LEONTES:
Go, do our bidding, hence!
LEONTES:
Exit HERMIONE, guarded, with Ladies
First Lord:
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.
ANTIGONUS:
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
ANTIGONUS:
Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer,
ANTIGONUS:
Yourself, your queen, your son.
First Lord:
For her, my lord,
First Lord:
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
First Lord:
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
First Lord:
I' the eyes of heaven and to you, I mean,
First Lord:
In this which you accuse her.
ANTIGONUS:
If it prove
ANTIGONUS:
She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
ANTIGONUS:
I lodge my wife, I'll go in couples with her,
ANTIGONUS:
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her,
ANTIGONUS:
For every inch of woman in the world,
ANTIGONUS:
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.
LEONTES:
Hold your peaces.
First Lord:
Good my lord,--
ANTIGONUS:
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves
ANTIGONUS:
You are abused and by some putter-on
ANTIGONUS:
That will be damn'd for't, would I knew the villain,
ANTIGONUS:
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
ANTIGONUS:
I have three daughters, the eldest is eleven
ANTIGONUS:
The second and the third, nine, and some five,
ANTIGONUS:
If this prove true, they'll pay for't
ANTIGONUS:
by mine honour,
ANTIGONUS:
I'll geld 'em all, fourteen they shall not see,
ANTIGONUS:
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs,
ANTIGONUS:
And I had rather glib myself than they
ANTIGONUS:
Should not produce fair issue.
LEONTES:
Cease, no more.
LEONTES:
You smell this business with a sense as cold
LEONTES:
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
LEONTES:
As you feel doing thus, and see withal
LEONTES:
The instruments that feel.
ANTIGONUS:
If it be so,
ANTIGONUS:
We need no grave to bury honesty
ANTIGONUS:
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
ANTIGONUS:
Of the whole dungy earth.
LEONTES:
What! lack I credit?
First Lord:
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
First Lord:
Upon this ground, and more it would content me
First Lord:
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
First Lord:
Be blamed for't how you might.
LEONTES:
Why, what need we
LEONTES:
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
LEONTES:
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
LEONTES:
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
LEONTES:
Imparts this, which if you, or stupefied
LEONTES:
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
LEONTES:
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
LEONTES:
We need no more of your advice: the matter,
LEONTES:
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
LEONTES:
Properly ours.
ANTIGONUS:
And I wish, my liege,
ANTIGONUS:
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
ANTIGONUS:
Without more overture.
LEONTES:
How could that be?
LEONTES:
Either thou art most ignorant by age,
LEONTES:
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
LEONTES:
Added to their familiarity,
LEONTES:
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
LEONTES:
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
LEONTES:
But only seeing, all other circumstances
LEONTES:
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding
LEONTES:
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
LEONTES:
For in an act of this importance 'twere
LEONTES:
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
LEONTES:
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
LEONTES:
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
LEONTES:
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
LEONTES:
They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,
LEONTES:
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
First Lord:
Well done, my lord.
LEONTES:
Though I am satisfied and need no more
LEONTES:
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
LEONTES:
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
LEONTES:
Whose ignorant credulity will not
LEONTES:
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
LEONTES:
From our free person she should be confined,
LEONTES:
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
LEONTES:
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us,
LEONTES:
We are to speak in public, for this business
LEONTES:
Will raise us all.
ANTIGONUS:
[Aside]
ANTIGONUS:
To laughter, as I take it,
ANTIGONUS:
If the good truth were known.
ANTIGONUS:
Exeunt
ANTIGONUS:
SCENE II. A prison.
ANTIGONUS:
Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants
PAULINA:
The keeper of the prison, call to him,
PAULINA:
let him have knowledge who I am.
PAULINA:
Exit Gentleman
PAULINA:
Good lady,
PAULINA:
No court in Europe is too good for thee,
PAULINA:
What dost thou then in prison?
PAULINA:
Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler
PAULINA:
Now, good sir,
PAULINA:
You know me, do you not?
Gaoler:
For a worthy lady
Gaoler:
And one whom much I honour.
PAULINA:
Pray you then,
PAULINA:
Conduct me to the queen.
Gaoler:
I may not, madam
Gaoler:
To the contrary I have express commandment.
PAULINA:
Here's ado,
PAULINA:
To lock up honesty and honour from
PAULINA:
The access of gentle visitors!
PAULINA:
Is't lawful, pray you,
PAULINA:
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
Gaoler:
So please you, madam,
Gaoler:
To put apart these your attendants, I
Gaoler:
Shall bring Emilia forth.
PAULINA:
I pray now, call her.
PAULINA:
Withdraw yourselves.
PAULINA:
Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants
Gaoler:
And, madam,
Gaoler:
I must be present at your conference.
PAULINA:
Well, be't so, prithee.
PAULINA:
Exit Gaoler
PAULINA:
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
PAULINA:
As passes colouring.
PAULINA:
Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA
PAULINA:
Dear gentlewoman,
PAULINA:
How fares our gracious lady?
EMILIA:
As well as one so great and so forlorn
EMILIA:
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
EMILIA:
Which never tender lady hath born greater,
EMILIA:
She is something before her time deliver'd.
PAULINA:
A boy?
EMILIA:
A daughter, and a goodly babe,
EMILIA:
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
EMILIA:
Much comfort in't, says 'My poor prisoner,
EMILIA:
I am innocent as you.'
PAULINA:
I dare be sworn
PAULINA:
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
PAULINA:
beshrew them!
PAULINA:
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
PAULINA:
Becomes a woman best, I'll take't upon me
PAULINA:
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
PAULINA:
And never to my red-look'd anger be
PAULINA:
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
PAULINA:
Commend my best obedience to the queen
PAULINA:
If she dares trust me with her little babe,
PAULINA:
I'll show't the king and undertake to be
PAULINA:
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
PAULINA:
How he may soften at the sight o' the child
PAULINA:
The silence often of pure innocence
PAULINA:
Persuades when speaking fails.
EMILIA:
Most worthy madam,
EMILIA:
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
EMILIA:
That your free undertaking cannot miss
EMILIA:
A thriving issue: there is no lady living
EMILIA:
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
EMILIA:
To visit the next room, I'll presently
EMILIA:
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer,
EMILIA:
Who  but to-day hammer'd of this design,
EMILIA:
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
EMILIA:
Lest she should be denied.
PAULINA:
Tell her, Emilia.
PAULINA:
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
PAULINA:
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
PAULINA:
I shall do good.
EMILIA:
Now be you blest for it!
EMILIA:
I'll to the queen: please you,
EMILIA:
come something nearer.
Gaoler:
Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
Gaoler:
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
Gaoler:
Having no warrant.
PAULINA:
You need not fear it, sir
PAULINA:
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
PAULINA:
By law and process of great nature thence
PAULINA:
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
PAULINA:
The anger of the king nor guilty of,
PAULINA:
If any be, the trespass of the queen.
Gaoler:
I do believe it.
PAULINA:
Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
PAULINA:
I will stand betwixt you and danger.
PAULINA:
Exeunt
PAULINA:
SCENE III. A room in LEONTES' palace.
PAULINA:
Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants
LEONTES:
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
LEONTES:
To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If
LEONTES:
The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
LEONTES:
She the adulteress, for the harlot king
LEONTES:
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
LEONTES:
And level of my brain, plot-proof, but she
LEONTES:
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
LEONTES:
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
LEONTES:
Might come to me again. Who's there?
First Servant:
My lord?
LEONTES:
How does the boy?
First Servant:
He took good rest to-night,
First Servant:
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
LEONTES:
To see his nobleness!
LEONTES:
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
LEONTES:
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
LEONTES:
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
LEONTES:
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
LEONTES:
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
LEONTES:
See how he fares.
LEONTES:
Exit Servant
LEONTES:
Fie, fie! no thought of him
LEONTES:
The thought of my revenges that way
LEONTES:
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
LEONTES:
And in his parties, his alliance, let him be
LEONTES:
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
LEONTES:
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
LEONTES:
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow
LEONTES:
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
LEONTES:
Shall she within my power.
LEONTES:
Enter PAULINA, with a child
First Lord:
You must not enter.
PAULINA:
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me
PAULINA:
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
PAULINA:
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
PAULINA:
More free than he is jealous.
ANTIGONUS:
That's enough.
Second Servant:
Madam, he hath not slept tonight, commanded
Second Servant:
None should come at him.
PAULINA:
Not so hot, good sir
PAULINA:
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
PAULINA:
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
PAULINA:
At each his needless heavings, such as you
PAULINA:
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
PAULINA:
Do come with words as medicinal as true,
PAULINA:
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
PAULINA:
That presses him from sleep.
LEONTES:
What noise there, ho?
PAULINA:
No noise, my lord, but needful conference
PAULINA:
About some gossips for your highness.
LEONTES:
How!
LEONTES:
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
LEONTES:
I charged thee that she should not come about me
LEONTES:
I knew she would.
ANTIGONUS:
I told her so, my lord,
ANTIGONUS:
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
ANTIGONUS:
She should not visit you.
LEONTES:
What, canst not rule her?
PAULINA:
From all dishonesty he can: in this,
PAULINA:
Unless he take the course that you have done,
PAULINA:
Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
PAULINA:
He shall not rule me.
ANTIGONUS:
La you now, you hear
ANTIGONUS:
When she will take the rein I let her run,
ANTIGONUS:
But she'll not stumble.
PAULINA:
Good my liege, I come,
PAULINA:
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
PAULINA:
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
PAULINA:
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
PAULINA:
Less appear so in comforting your evils,
PAULINA:
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
PAULINA:
From your good queen.
LEONTES:
Good queen!
PAULINA:
Good queen, my lord,
PAULINA:
Good queen, I say good queen,
PAULINA:
And would by combat make her good, so were I
PAULINA:
A man, the worst about you.
LEONTES:
Force her hence.
PAULINA:
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
PAULINA:
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off,
PAULINA:
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
PAULINA:
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter,
PAULINA:
Here 'tis, commends it to your blessing.
PAULINA:
Laying down the child
LEONTES:
Out!
LEONTES:
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door
LEONTES:
A most intelligencing bawd!
PAULINA:
Not so
PAULINA:
I am as ignorant in that as you
PAULINA:
In so entitling me, and no less honest
PAULINA:
Than you are mad, which is enough, I'll warrant,
PAULINA:
As this world goes, to pass for honest.
LEONTES:
Traitors!
LEONTES:
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
LEONTES:
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
LEONTES:
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,
LEONTES:
Take't up, I say, give't to thy crone.
PAULINA:
For ever
PAULINA:
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
PAULINA:
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
PAULINA:
Which he has put upon't!
LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.
PAULINA:
So I would you did, then 'twere past all doubt
PAULINA:
You'ld call your children yours.
LEONTES:
A nest of traitors!
ANTIGONUS:
I am none, by this good light.
PAULINA:
Nor I, nor any
PAULINA:
But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
PAULINA:
The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
PAULINA:
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
PAULINA:
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's,
PAULINA:
and will not--
PAULINA:
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
PAULINA:
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
PAULINA:
The root of his opinion, which is rotten
PAULINA:
As ever oak or stone was sound.
LEONTES:
A callat
LEONTES:
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
LEONTES:
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine,
LEONTES:
It is the issue of Polixenes
LEONTES:
Hence with it, and together with the dam
LEONTES:
Commit them to the fire!
PAULINA:
It is yours,
PAULINA:
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
PAULINA:
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
PAULINA:
Although the print be little, the whole matter
PAULINA:
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
PAULINA:
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
PAULINA:
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
PAULINA:
His smiles,
PAULINA:
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger
PAULINA:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
PAULINA:
So like to him that got it, if thou hast
PAULINA:
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
PAULINA:
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
PAULINA:
Her children not her husband's!
LEONTES:
A gross hag
LEONTES:
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
LEONTES:
That wilt not stay her tongue.
ANTIGONUS:
Hang all the husbands
ANTIGONUS:
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
ANTIGONUS:
Hardly one subject.
LEONTES:
Once more, take her hence.
PAULINA:
A most unworthy and unnatural lord
PAULINA:
Can do no more.
LEONTES:
I'll ha' thee burnt.
PAULINA:
I care not
PAULINA:
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
PAULINA:
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant,
PAULINA:
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
PAULINA:
Not able to produce more accusation
PAULINA:
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
PAULINA:
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
PAULINA:
Yea, scandalous to the world.
LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
LEONTES:
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
LEONTES:
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
LEONTES:
If she did know me one. Away with her!
PAULINA:
I pray you, do not push me, I'll be gone.
PAULINA:
Look to your babe, my lord, 'tis yours
PAULINA:
Jove send her
PAULINA:
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
PAULINA:
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
PAULINA:
Will never do him good, not one of you.
PAULINA:
So, so: farewell, we are gone.
PAULINA:
Exit
LEONTES:
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
LEONTES:
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
LEONTES:
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
LEONTES:
And see it instantly consumed with fire,
LEONTES:
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight
LEONTES:
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
LEONTES:
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
LEONTES:
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
LEONTES:
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so,
LEONTES:
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
LEONTES:
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire,
LEONTES:
For thou set'st on thy wife.
ANTIGONUS:
I did not, sir
ANTIGONUS:
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
ANTIGONUS:
Can clear me in't.
Lords:
We can: my royal liege,
Lords:
He is not guilty of her coming hither.
LEONTES:
You're liars all.
First Lord:
Beseech your highness, give us better credit
First Lord:
We have always truly served you, and beseech you
First Lord:
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
First Lord:
As recompense of our dear services
First Lord:
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
First Lord:
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
First Lord:
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
LEONTES:
I am a feather for each wind that blows
LEONTES:
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
LEONTES:
And call me father? better burn it now
LEONTES:
Than curse it then. But be it, let it live.
LEONTES:
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither,
LEONTES:
You that have been so tenderly officious
LEONTES:
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
LEONTES:
To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
LEONTES:
So sure as this beard's grey,
LEONTES:
--what will you adventure
LEONTES:
To save this brat's life?
ANTIGONUS:
Any thing, my lord,
ANTIGONUS:
That my ability may undergo
ANTIGONUS:
And nobleness impose: at least thus much
ANTIGONUS:
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
ANTIGONUS:
To save the innocent: any thing possible.
LEONTES:
It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
LEONTES:
Thou wilt perform my bidding.
ANTIGONUS:
I will, my lord.
LEONTES:
Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
LEONTES:
Of any point in't shall not only be
LEONTES:
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
LEONTES:
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
LEONTES:
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
LEONTES:
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
LEONTES:
To some remote and desert place quite out
LEONTES:
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
LEONTES:
Without more mercy, to its own protection
LEONTES:
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
LEONTES:
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
LEONTES:
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
LEONTES:
That thou commend it strangely to some place
LEONTES:
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
ANTIGONUS:
I swear to do this, though a present death
ANTIGONUS:
Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe
ANTIGONUS:
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
ANTIGONUS:
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
ANTIGONUS:
Casting their savageness aside have done
ANTIGONUS:
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
ANTIGONUS:
In more than this deed does require! And blessing
ANTIGONUS:
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
ANTIGONUS:
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!
ANTIGONUS:
Exit with the child
LEONTES:
No, I'll not rear
LEONTES:
Another's issue.
LEONTES:
Enter a Servant
Servant:
Please your highness, posts
Servant:
From those you sent to the oracle are come
Servant:
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
Servant:
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
Servant:
Hasting to the court.
First Lord:
So please you, sir, their speed
First Lord:
Hath been beyond account.
LEONTES:
Twenty-three days
LEONTES:
They have been absent: 'tis good speed, foretells
LEONTES:
The great Apollo suddenly will have
LEONTES:
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords,
LEONTES:
Summon a session, that we may arraign
LEONTES:
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
LEONTES:
Been publicly accused, so shall she have
LEONTES:
A just and open trial. While she lives
LEONTES:
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
LEONTES:
And think upon my bidding.
LEONTES:
Exeunt
LEONTES:
ACT III
LEONTES:
SCENE I. A sea-port in Sicilia.
LEONTES:
Enter CLEOMENES and DION
CLEOMENES:
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
CLEOMENES:
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
CLEOMENES:
The common praise it bears.
DION:
I shall report,
DION:
For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
DION:
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
DION:
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
DION:
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
DION:
It was i' the offering!
CLEOMENES:
But of all, the burst
CLEOMENES:
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
CLEOMENES:
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
CLEOMENES:
That I was nothing.
DION:
If the event o' the journey
DION:
Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
DION:
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
DION:
The time is worth the use on't.
CLEOMENES:
Great Apollo
CLEOMENES:
Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
CLEOMENES:
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
CLEOMENES:
I little like.
DION:
The violent carriage of it
DION:
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
DION:
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
DION:
Shall the contents discover, something rare
DION:
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
DION:
And gracious be the issue!
DION:
Exeunt
DION:
SCENE II. A court of Justice.
DION:
Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers
LEONTES:
This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
LEONTES:
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
LEONTES:
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
LEONTES:
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
LEONTES:
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
LEONTES:
Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
LEONTES:
Even to the guilt or the purgation.
LEONTES:
Produce the prisoner.
Officer:
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
Officer:
Appear in person here in court. Silence!
Officer:
Enter HERMIONE guarded, PAULINA and Ladies attending
LEONTES:
Read the indictment.
Officer:
[Reads]            Hermione, queen to the worthy
Officer:
Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and
Officer:
arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery
Officer:
with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring
Officer:
with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
Officer:
lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence
Officer:
whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,
Officer:
thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance
Officer:
of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for
Officer:
their better safety, to fly away by night.
HERMIONE:
Since what I am to say must be but that
HERMIONE:
Which contradicts my accusation and
HERMIONE:
The testimony on my part no other
HERMIONE:
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
HERMIONE:
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
HERMIONE:
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
HERMIONE:
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
HERMIONE:
Behold our human actions, as they do,
HERMIONE:
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
HERMIONE:
False accusation blush and tyranny
HERMIONE:
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
HERMIONE:
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
HERMIONE:
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
HERMIONE:
As I am now unhappy, which is more
HERMIONE:
Than history can pattern, though devised
HERMIONE:
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
HERMIONE:
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
HERMIONE:
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
HERMIONE:
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
HERMIONE:
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
HERMIONE:
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
HERMIONE:
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
HERMIONE:
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
HERMIONE:
And only that I stand for. I appeal
HERMIONE:
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
HERMIONE:
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
HERMIONE:
How merited to be so, since he came,
HERMIONE:
With what encounter so uncurrent I
HERMIONE:
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
HERMIONE:
The bound of honour, or in act or will
HERMIONE:
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
HERMIONE:
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
HERMIONE:
Cry fie upon my grave!
LEONTES:
I ne'er heard yet
LEONTES:
That any of these bolder vices wanted
LEONTES:
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
LEONTES:
Than to perform it first.
HERMIONE:
That's true enough,
HERMIONE:
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
LEONTES:
You will not own it.
HERMIONE:
More than mistress of
HERMIONE:
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
HERMIONE:
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
HERMIONE:
With whom I am accused, I do confess
HERMIONE:
I loved him as in honour he required,
HERMIONE:
With such a kind of love as might become
HERMIONE:
A lady like me, with a love even such,
HERMIONE:
So and no other, as yourself commanded
HERMIONE:
Which not to have done I think had been in me
HERMIONE:
Both disobedience and ingratitude
HERMIONE:
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
HERMIONE:
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
HERMIONE:
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
HERMIONE:
I know not how it tastes, though it be dish'd
HERMIONE:
For me to try how: all I know of it
HERMIONE:
Is that Camillo was an honest man,
HERMIONE:
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
HERMIONE:
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
LEONTES:
You knew of his departure, as you know
LEONTES:
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
HERMIONE:
Sir,
HERMIONE:
You speak a language that I understand not
HERMIONE:
My life stands in the level of your dreams,
HERMIONE:
Which I'll lay down.
LEONTES:
Your actions are my dreams,
LEONTES:
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
LEONTES:
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
LEONTES:
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth
LEONTES:
Which to deny concerns more than avails, for as
LEONTES:
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
LEONTES:
No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
LEONTES:
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
LEONTES:
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
LEONTES:
Look for no less than death.
HERMIONE:
Sir, spare your threats
HERMIONE:
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
HERMIONE:
To me can life be no commodity
HERMIONE:
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
HERMIONE:
I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,
HERMIONE:
But know not how it went. My second joy
HERMIONE:
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
HERMIONE:
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
HERMIONE:
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
HERMIONE:
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
HERMIONE:
Haled out to murder: myself on every post
HERMIONE:
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
HERMIONE:
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
HERMIONE:
To women of all fashion, lastly, hurried
HERMIONE:
Here to this place, i' the open air, before
HERMIONE:
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
HERMIONE:
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
HERMIONE:
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
HERMIONE:
But yet hear this: mistake me not, no life,
HERMIONE:
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
HERMIONE:
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
HERMIONE:
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
HERMIONE:
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
HERMIONE:
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
HERMIONE:
I do refer me to the oracle
HERMIONE:
Apollo be my judge!
First Lord:
This your request
First Lord:
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
First Lord:
And in Apollos name, his oracle.
First Lord:
Exeunt certain Officers
HERMIONE:
The Emperor of Russia was my father
HERMIONE:
O that he were alive, and here beholding
HERMIONE:
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
HERMIONE:
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
HERMIONE:
Of pity, not revenge!
HERMIONE:
Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION
Officer:
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
Officer:
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Officer:
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
Officer:
The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
Officer:
Of great Apollo's priest, and that, since then,
Officer:
You have not dared to break the holy seal
Officer:
Nor read the secrets in't.
DION:
All this we swear.
LEONTES:
Break up the seals and read.
Officer:
[Reads]	Hermione is chaste,
Officer:
Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject, Leontes
Officer:
a jealous tyrant, his innocent babe truly begotten,
Officer:
and the king shall live without an heir, if that
Officer:
which is lost be not found.
Lords:
Now blessed be the great Apollo!
HERMIONE:
Praised!
LEONTES:
Hast thou read truth?
Officer:
Ay, my lord, even so
Officer:
As it is here set down.
LEONTES:
There is no truth at all i' the oracle
LEONTES:
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
LEONTES:
Enter Servant
Servant:
My lord the king, the king!
LEONTES:
What is the business?
Servant:
O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
Servant:
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
Servant:
Of the queen's speed, is gone.
LEONTES:
How! gone!
Servant:
Is dead.
LEONTES:
Apollo's angry, and the heavens themselves
LEONTES:
Do strike at my injustice.
LEONTES:
HERMIONE swoons
LEONTES:
How now there!
PAULINA:
This news is mortal to the queen: look down
PAULINA:
And see what death is doing.
LEONTES:
Take her hence
LEONTES:
Her heart is but o'ercharged, she will recover
LEONTES:
I have too much believed mine own suspicion
LEONTES:
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
LEONTES:
Some remedies for life.
LEONTES:
Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE
LEONTES:
Apollo, pardon
LEONTES:
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
LEONTES:
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
LEONTES:
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
LEONTES:
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy,
LEONTES:
For, being transported by my jealousies
LEONTES:
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
LEONTES:
Camillo for the minister to poison
LEONTES:
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
LEONTES:
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
LEONTES:
My swift command, though I with death and with
LEONTES:
Reward did threaten and encourage him,
LEONTES:
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
LEONTES:
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
LEONTES:
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
LEONTES:
Which you knew great, and to the hazard
LEONTES:
Of all encertainties himself commended,
LEONTES:
No richer than his honour: how he glisters
LEONTES:
Thorough my rust! and how his pity
LEONTES:
Does my deeds make the blacker!
LEONTES:
Re-enter PAULINA
PAULINA:
Woe the while!
PAULINA:
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
PAULINA:
Break too.
First Lord:
What fit is this, good lady?
PAULINA:
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
PAULINA:
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
PAULINA:
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
PAULINA:
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
PAULINA:
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
PAULINA:
Together working with thy jealousies,
PAULINA:
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
PAULINA:
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
PAULINA:
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
PAULINA:
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
PAULINA:
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing,
PAULINA:
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
PAULINA:
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
PAULINA:
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
PAULINA:
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
PAULINA:
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
PAULINA:
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
PAULINA:
To be or none or little, though a devil
PAULINA:
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't
PAULINA:
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
PAULINA:
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
PAULINA:
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
PAULINA:
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
PAULINA:
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
PAULINA:
Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
PAULINA:
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
PAULINA:
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
PAULINA:
and vengeance for't
PAULINA:
Not dropp'd down yet.
First Lord:
The higher powers forbid!
PAULINA:
I say she's dead, I'll swear't. If word nor oath
PAULINA:
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
PAULINA:
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
PAULINA:
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
PAULINA:
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
PAULINA:
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
PAULINA:
Than all thy woes can stir, therefore betake thee
PAULINA:
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
PAULINA:
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
PAULINA:
Upon a barren mountain and still winter
PAULINA:
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
PAULINA:
To look that way thou wert.
LEONTES:
Go on, go on
LEONTES:
Thou canst not speak too much, I have deserved
LEONTES:
All tongues to talk their bitterest.
First Lord:
Say no more
First Lord:
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
First Lord:
I' the boldness of your speech.
PAULINA:
I am sorry for't
PAULINA:
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
PAULINA:
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
PAULINA:
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
PAULINA:
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
PAULINA:
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
PAULINA:
At my petition, I beseech you, rather
PAULINA:
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
PAULINA:
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
PAULINA:
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman
PAULINA:
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
PAULINA:
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children,
PAULINA:
I'll not remember you of my own lord,
PAULINA:
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
PAULINA:
And I'll say nothing.
LEONTES:
Thou didst speak but well
LEONTES:
When most the truth, which I receive much better
LEONTES:
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
LEONTES:
To the dead bodies of my queen and son
LEONTES:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
LEONTES:
The causes of their death appear, unto
LEONTES:
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
LEONTES:
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
LEONTES:
Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
LEONTES:
Will bear up with this exercise, so long
LEONTES:
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
LEONTES:
Unto these sorrows.
LEONTES:
Exeunt
LEONTES:
SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.
LEONTES:
Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner
ANTIGONUS:
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
ANTIGONUS:
The deserts of Bohemia?
Mariner:
Ay, my lord: and fear
Mariner:
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
Mariner:
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
Mariner:
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
Mariner:
And frown upon 's.
ANTIGONUS:
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard,
ANTIGONUS:
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
ANTIGONUS:
I call upon thee.
Mariner:
Make your best haste, and go not
Mariner:
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather,
Mariner:
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
Mariner:
Of prey that keep upon't.
ANTIGONUS:
Go thou away
ANTIGONUS:
I'll follow instantly.
Mariner:
I am glad at heart
Mariner:
To be so rid o' the business.
Mariner:
Exit
ANTIGONUS:
Come, poor babe
ANTIGONUS:
I have heard, but not believed,
ANTIGONUS:
the spirits o' the dead
ANTIGONUS:
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
ANTIGONUS:
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
ANTIGONUS:
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
ANTIGONUS:
Sometimes her head on one side, some another,
ANTIGONUS:
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
ANTIGONUS:
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
ANTIGONUS:
Like very sanctity, she did approach
ANTIGONUS:
My cabin where I lay, thrice bow'd before me,
ANTIGONUS:
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
ANTIGONUS:
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
ANTIGONUS:
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
ANTIGONUS:
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
ANTIGONUS:
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
ANTIGONUS:
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
ANTIGONUS:
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
ANTIGONUS:
There weep and leave it crying, and, for the babe
ANTIGONUS:
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
ANTIGONUS:
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
ANTIGONUS:
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
ANTIGONUS:
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
ANTIGONUS:
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
ANTIGONUS:
I did in time collect myself and thought
ANTIGONUS:
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys
ANTIGONUS:
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
ANTIGONUS:
I will be squared by this. I do believe
ANTIGONUS:
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
ANTIGONUS:
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
ANTIGONUS:
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
ANTIGONUS:
Either for life or death, upon the earth
ANTIGONUS:
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
ANTIGONUS:
There lie, and there thy character: there these,
ANTIGONUS:
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
ANTIGONUS:
And still rest thine. The storm begins, poor wretch,
ANTIGONUS:
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
ANTIGONUS:
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
ANTIGONUS:
But my heart bleeds, and most accursed am I
ANTIGONUS:
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
ANTIGONUS:
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
ANTIGONUS:
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
ANTIGONUS:
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
ANTIGONUS:
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase
ANTIGONUS:
I am gone for ever.
ANTIGONUS:
Exit, pursued by a bear
ANTIGONUS:
Enter a Shepherd
Shepherd:
I would there were no age between sixteen and
Shepherd:
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
Shepherd:
rest, for there is nothing in the between but
Shepherd:
getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
Shepherd:
stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
Shepherd:
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
Shepherd:
hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
Shepherd:
best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
Shepherd:
than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
Shepherd:
the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
Shepherd:
will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
Shepherd:
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
Shepherd:
pretty one, a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape
Shepherd:
though I am not bookish, yet I can read
Shepherd:
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
Shepherd:
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
Shepherd:
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
Shepherd:
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
Shepherd:
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come, he hallooed
Shepherd:
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!
Shepherd:
Enter Clown
Clown:
Hilloa, loa!
Shepherd:
What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
Shepherd:
on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
Shepherd:
ailest thou, man?
Clown:
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
Clown:
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
Clown:
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
Clown:
a bodkin's point.
Shepherd:
Why, boy, how is it?
Clown:
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
Clown:
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
Clown:
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
Clown:
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em, now the
Clown:
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
Clown:
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
Clown:
cork into a hogshead. And then for the
Clown:
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
Clown:
shoulder-bone, how he cried to me for help and said
Clown:
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
Clown:
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
Clown:
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
Clown:
sea mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared
Clown:
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
Clown:
the sea or weather.
Shepherd:
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
Clown:
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
Clown:
sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
Clown:
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
Clown:
now.
Shepherd:
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!
Clown:
I would you had been by the ship side, to have
Clown:
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
Shepherd:
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
Shepherd:
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
Shepherd:
dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
Shepherd:
thee, look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
Shepherd:
child! look thee here, take up, take up, boy,
Shepherd:
open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
Shepherd:
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling
Shepherd:
open't. What's within, boy?
Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
Clown:
are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!
Shepherd:
This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
Shepherd:
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
Shepherd:
We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires
Shepherd:
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
Shepherd:
boy, the next way home.
Clown:
Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
Clown:
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
Clown:
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
Clown:
are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
Clown:
it.
Shepherd:
That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
Shepherd:
which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
Shepherd:
sight of him.
Clown:
Marry, will I, and you shall help to put him i' the ground.
Shepherd:
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.
Shepherd:
Exeunt

ACT IV
Shepherd:
SCENE I
Shepherd:
Enter Time, the Chorus
Time:
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Time:
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
Time:
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
Time:
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
Time:
To me or my swift passage, that I slide
Time:
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Time:
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
Time:
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
Time:
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
Time:
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
Time:
Or what is now received: I witness to
Time:
The times that brought them in, so shall I do
Time:
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
Time:
The glistering of this present, as my tale
Time:
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
Time:
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
Time:
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
Time:
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
Time:
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
Time:
Gentle spectators, that I now may be
Time:
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
Time:
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
Time:
I now name to you, and with speed so pace
Time:
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
Time:
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
Time:
I list not prophecy, but let Time's news
Time:
Be known when 'tis brought forth.
Time:
A shepherd's daughter,
Time:
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
Time:
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
Time:
If ever you have spent time worse ere now,
Time:
If never, yet that Time himself doth say
Time:
He wishes earnestly you never may.
Time:
Exit
Time:
SCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.
Time:
Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO
POLIXENES:
I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate
POLIXENES:
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing, a death to
POLIXENES:
grant this.
CAMILLO:
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
CAMILLO:
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
CAMILLO:
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
CAMILLO:
king, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling
CAMILLO:
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
CAMILLO:
think so, which is another spur to my departure.
POLIXENES:
As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
POLIXENES:
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
POLIXENES:
thee thine own goodness hath made, better not to
POLIXENES:
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
POLIXENES:
made me businesses which none without thee can
POLIXENES:
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
POLIXENES:
them thyself or take away with thee the very
POLIXENES:
services thou hast done, which if I have not enough
POLIXENES:
considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
POLIXENES:
thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
POLIXENES:
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
POLIXENES:
country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very
POLIXENES:
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
POLIXENES:
penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
POLIXENES:
my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen
POLIXENES:
and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
POLIXENES:
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
POLIXENES:
son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
POLIXENES:
being gracious, than they are in losing them when
POLIXENES:
they have approved their virtues.
CAMILLO:
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
CAMILLO:
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
CAMILLO:
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
CAMILLO:
from court and is less frequent to his princely
CAMILLO:
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
POLIXENES:
I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
POLIXENES:
care, so far that I have eyes under my service which
POLIXENES:
look upon his removedness, from whom I have this
POLIXENES:
intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
POLIXENES:
most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from
POLIXENES:
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
POLIXENES:
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.
CAMILLO:
I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
CAMILLO:
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
CAMILLO:
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.
POLIXENES:
That's likewise part of my intelligence, but, I
POLIXENES:
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
POLIXENES:
shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not
POLIXENES:
appearing what we are, have some question with the
POLIXENES:
shepherd, from whose simplicity I think it not
POLIXENES:
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
POLIXENES:
Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
POLIXENES:
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
CAMILLO:
I willingly obey your command.
POLIXENES:
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.
POLIXENES:
Exeunt
POLIXENES:
SCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.
POLIXENES:
Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing
AUTOLYCUS:
When daffodils begin to peer,
AUTOLYCUS:
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
AUTOLYCUS:
Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year,
AUTOLYCUS:
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
AUTOLYCUS:
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
AUTOLYCUS:
With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
AUTOLYCUS:
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge,
AUTOLYCUS:
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
AUTOLYCUS:
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
AUTOLYCUS:
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
AUTOLYCUS:
Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
AUTOLYCUS:
While we lie tumbling in the hay.
AUTOLYCUS:
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
AUTOLYCUS:
wore three-pile, but now I am out of service
AUTOLYCUS:
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
AUTOLYCUS:
The pale moon shines by night
AUTOLYCUS:
And when I wander here and there,
AUTOLYCUS:
I then do most go right.
AUTOLYCUS:
If tinkers may have leave to live,
AUTOLYCUS:
And bear the sow-skin budget,
AUTOLYCUS:
Then my account I well may, give,
AUTOLYCUS:
And in the stocks avouch it.
AUTOLYCUS:
My traffic is sheets, when the kite builds, look to
AUTOLYCUS:
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus, who
AUTOLYCUS:
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
AUTOLYCUS:
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
AUTOLYCUS:
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
AUTOLYCUS:
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
AUTOLYCUS:
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
AUTOLYCUS:
me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
AUTOLYCUS:
of it. A prize! a prize!
AUTOLYCUS:
Enter Clown
Clown:
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods, every tod
Clown:
yields pound and odd shilling, fifteen hundred
Clown:
shorn. what comes the wool to?
AUTOLYCUS:
[Aside]
AUTOLYCUS:
If the springe hold, the cock's mine.
Clown:
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see, what am
Clown:
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
Clown:
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
Clown:
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
Clown:
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
Clown:
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
Clown:
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
Clown:
ones, but they are most of them means and bases, but
Clown:
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
Clown:
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
Clown:
pies, mace, dates?--none, that's out of my note,
Clown:
nutmegs, seven, a race or two of ginger, but that I
Clown:
may beg, four pound of prunes, and as many of
Clown:
raisins o' the sun.
AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever I was born!
AUTOLYCUS:
Grovelling on the ground
Clown:
I' the name of me--
AUTOLYCUS:
O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags, and
AUTOLYCUS:
then, death, death!
Clown:
Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
Clown:
on thee, rather than have these off.
AUTOLYCUS:
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
AUTOLYCUS:
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
AUTOLYCUS:
ones and millions.
Clown:
Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
Clown:
great matter.
AUTOLYCUS:
I am robbed, sir, and beaten, my money and apparel
AUTOLYCUS:
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
AUTOLYCUS:
me.
Clown:
What, by a horseman, or a footman?
AUTOLYCUS:
A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
Clown:
Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
Clown:
has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
Clown:
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
Clown:
I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.
AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, tenderly, O!
Clown:
Alas, poor soul!
AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
AUTOLYCUS:
shoulder-blade is out.
Clown:
How now! canst stand?
AUTOLYCUS:
[Picking his pocket]
AUTOLYCUS:
Softly, dear sir, good sir, softly. You ha' done me
AUTOLYCUS:
a charitable office.
Clown:
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
AUTOLYCUS:
No, good sweet sir, no, I beseech you, sir: I have
AUTOLYCUS:
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
AUTOLYCUS:
unto whom I was going, I shall there have money, or
AUTOLYCUS:
any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you,
AUTOLYCUS:
that kills my heart.
Clown:
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
AUTOLYCUS:
A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
AUTOLYCUS:
troll-my-dames, I knew him once a servant of the
AUTOLYCUS:
prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
AUTOLYCUS:
virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.
Clown:
His vices, you would say, there's no virtue whipped
Clown:
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
Clown:
there, and yet it will no more but abide.
AUTOLYCUS:
Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
AUTOLYCUS:
hath been since an ape-bearer, then a
AUTOLYCUS:
process-server, a bailiff, then he compassed a
AUTOLYCUS:
motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
AUTOLYCUS:
wife within a mile where my land and living lies,
AUTOLYCUS:
and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
AUTOLYCUS:
settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.
Clown:
Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
Clown:
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.
AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, sir, he, sir, he, that's the rogue that
AUTOLYCUS:
put me into this apparel.
Clown:
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
Clown:
but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.
AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
AUTOLYCUS:
false of heart that way, and that he knew, I warrant
AUTOLYCUS:
him.
Clown:
How do you now?
AUTOLYCUS:
Sweet sir, much better than I was, I can stand and
AUTOLYCUS:
walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
AUTOLYCUS:
softly towards my kinsman's.
Clown:
Shall I bring thee on the way?
AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir, no, sweet sir.
Clown:
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
Clown:
sheep-shearing.
AUTOLYCUS:
Prosper you, sweet sir!
AUTOLYCUS:
Exit Clown
AUTOLYCUS:
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
AUTOLYCUS:
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
AUTOLYCUS:
make not this cheat bring out another and the
AUTOLYCUS:
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
AUTOLYCUS:
put in the book of virtue!
AUTOLYCUS:
Sings
AUTOLYCUS:
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
AUTOLYCUS:
And merrily hent the stile-a
AUTOLYCUS:
A merry heart goes all the day,
AUTOLYCUS:
Your sad tires in a mile-a.
AUTOLYCUS:
Exit
AUTOLYCUS:
SCENE IV. The Shepherd's cottage.
AUTOLYCUS:
Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA
FLORIZEL:
These your unusual weeds to each part of you
FLORIZEL:
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
FLORIZEL:
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
FLORIZEL:
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
FLORIZEL:
And you the queen on't.
PERDITA:
Sir, my gracious lord,
PERDITA:
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me
PERDITA:
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
PERDITA:
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
PERDITA:
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
PERDITA:
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
PERDITA:
In every mess have folly and the feeders
PERDITA:
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
PERDITA:
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
PERDITA:
To show myself a glass.
FLORIZEL:
I bless the time
FLORIZEL:
When my good falcon made her flight across
FLORIZEL:
Thy father's ground.
PERDITA:
Now Jove afford you cause!
PERDITA:
To me the difference forges dread, your greatness
PERDITA:
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
PERDITA:
To think your father, by some accident,
PERDITA:
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
PERDITA:
How would he look, to see his work so noble
PERDITA:
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
PERDITA:
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
PERDITA:
The sternness of his presence?
FLORIZEL:
Apprehend
FLORIZEL:
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
FLORIZEL:
Humbling their deities to love, have taken
FLORIZEL:
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
FLORIZEL:
Became a bull, and bellow'd, the green Neptune
FLORIZEL:
A ram, and bleated, and the fire-robed god,
FLORIZEL:
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
FLORIZEL:
As I seem now. Their transformations
FLORIZEL:
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
FLORIZEL:
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
FLORIZEL:
Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
FLORIZEL:
Burn hotter than my faith.
PERDITA:
O, but, sir,
PERDITA:
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
PERDITA:
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king
PERDITA:
One of these two must be necessities,
PERDITA:
Which then will speak, that you must
PERDITA:
change this purpose,
PERDITA:
Or I my life.
FLORIZEL:
Thou dearest Perdita,
FLORIZEL:
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
FLORIZEL:
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
FLORIZEL:
Or not my father's. For I cannot be
FLORIZEL:
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
FLORIZEL:
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
FLORIZEL:
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle,
FLORIZEL:
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
FLORIZEL:
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming
FLORIZEL:
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
FLORIZEL:
Of celebration of that nuptial which
FLORIZEL:
We two have sworn shall come.
PERDITA:
O lady Fortune,
PERDITA:
Stand you auspicious!
FLORIZEL:
See, your guests approach
FLORIZEL:
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
FLORIZEL:
And let's be red with mirth.
FLORIZEL:
Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised
Shepherd:
Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
Shepherd:
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
Shepherd:
Both dame and servant, welcomed all, served all,
Shepherd:
Would sing her song and dance her turn, now here,
Shepherd:
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle,
Shepherd:
On his shoulder, and his, her face o' fire
Shepherd:
With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
Shepherd:
She would to each one sip. You are retired,
Shepherd:
As if you were a feasted one and not
Shepherd:
The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
Shepherd:
These unknown friends to's welcome, for it is
Shepherd:
A way to make us better friends, more known.
Shepherd:
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
Shepherd:
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
Shepherd:
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
Shepherd:
As your good flock shall prosper.
PERDITA:
[To POLIXENES]                  Sir, welcome
PERDITA:
It is my father's will I should take on me
PERDITA:
The hostess-ship o' the day.
PERDITA:
To CAMILLO
PERDITA:
You're welcome, sir.
PERDITA:
Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
PERDITA:
For you there's rosemary and rue, these keep
PERDITA:
Seeming and savour all the winter long
PERDITA:
Grace and remembrance be to you both,
PERDITA:
And welcome to our shearing!
POLIXENES:
Shepherdess,
POLIXENES:
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
POLIXENES:
With flowers of winter.
PERDITA:
Sir, the year growing ancient,
PERDITA:
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
PERDITA:
Of trembling winter, the fairest
PERDITA:
flowers o' the season
PERDITA:
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
PERDITA:
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
PERDITA:
Our rustic garden's barren, and I care not
PERDITA:
To get slips of them.
POLIXENES:
Wherefore, gentle maiden,
POLIXENES:
Do you neglect them?
PERDITA:
For I have heard it said
PERDITA:
There is an art which in their piedness shares
PERDITA:
With great creating nature.
POLIXENES:
Say there be,
POLIXENES:
Yet nature is made better by no mean
POLIXENES:
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
POLIXENES:
Which you say adds to nature, is an art
POLIXENES:
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
POLIXENES:
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
POLIXENES:
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
POLIXENES:
By bud of nobler race: this is an art
POLIXENES:
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
POLIXENES:
The art itself is nature.
PERDITA:
So it is.
POLIXENES:
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
POLIXENES:
And do not call them bastards.
PERDITA:
I'll not put
PERDITA:
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them,
PERDITA:
No more than were I painted I would wish
PERDITA:
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
PERDITA:
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you,
PERDITA:
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram,
PERDITA:
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
PERDITA:
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
PERDITA:
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
PERDITA:
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
CAMILLO:
I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
CAMILLO:
And only live by gazing.
PERDITA:
Out, alas!
PERDITA:
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
PERDITA:
Would blow you through and through.
PERDITA:
Now, my fair'st friend,
PERDITA:
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
PERDITA:
Become your time of day, and yours, and yours,
PERDITA:
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
PERDITA:
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
PERDITA:
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
PERDITA:
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
PERDITA:
That come before the swallow dares, and take
PERDITA:
The winds of March with beauty, violets dim,
PERDITA:
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
PERDITA:
Or Cytherea's breath, pale primroses
PERDITA:
That die unmarried, ere they can behold
PERDITA:
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
PERDITA:
Most incident to maids, bold oxlips and
PERDITA:
The crown imperial, lilies of all kinds,
PERDITA:
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
PERDITA:
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
PERDITA:
To strew him o'er and o'er!
FLORIZEL:
What, like a corse?
PERDITA:
No, like a bank for love to lie and play on,
PERDITA:
Not like a corse, or if, not to be buried,
PERDITA:
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers
PERDITA:
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
PERDITA:
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
PERDITA:
Does change my disposition.
FLORIZEL:
What you do
FLORIZEL:
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
FLORIZEL:
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
FLORIZEL:
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
FLORIZEL:
Pray so, and, for the ordering your affairs,
FLORIZEL:
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
FLORIZEL:
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
FLORIZEL:
Nothing but that, move still, still so,
FLORIZEL:
And own no other function: each your doing,
FLORIZEL:
So singular in each particular,
FLORIZEL:
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
FLORIZEL:
That all your acts are queens.
PERDITA:
O Doricles,
PERDITA:
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
PERDITA:
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
PERDITA:
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
PERDITA:
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
PERDITA:
You woo'd me the false way.
FLORIZEL:
I think you have
FLORIZEL:
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
FLORIZEL:
To put you to't. But come, our dance, I pray
FLORIZEL:
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
FLORIZEL:
That never mean to part.
PERDITA:
I'll swear for 'em.
POLIXENES:
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
POLIXENES:
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
POLIXENES:
But smacks of something greater than herself,
POLIXENES:
Too noble for this place.
CAMILLO:
He tells her something
CAMILLO:
That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
CAMILLO:
The queen of curds and cream.
Clown:
Come on, strike up!
DORCAS:
Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
DORCAS:
To mend her kissing with!
MOPSA:
Now, in good time!
Clown:
Not a word, a word, we stand upon our manners.
Clown:
Come, strike up!
Clown:
Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses
POLIXENES:
Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
POLIXENES:
Which dances with your daughter?
Shepherd:
They call him Doricles, and boasts himself
Shepherd:
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
Shepherd:
Upon his own report and I believe it,
Shepherd:
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter
Shepherd:
I think so too, for never gazed the moon
Shepherd:
Upon the water as he'll stand and read
Shepherd:
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
Shepherd:
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Shepherd:
Who loves another best.
POLIXENES:
She dances featly.
Shepherd:
So she does any thing, though I report it,
Shepherd:
That should be silent: if young Doricles
Shepherd:
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
Shepherd:
Which he not dreams of.
Shepherd:
Enter Servant
Servant:
O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
Servant:
door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
Servant:
pipe, no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
Servant:
several tunes faster than you'll tell money, he
Servant:
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
Servant:
ears grew to his tunes.
Clown:
He could never come better, he shall come in. I
Clown:
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
Clown:
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
Clown:
indeed and sung lamentably.
Servant:
He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes, no
Servant:
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
Servant:
has the prettiest love-songs for maids, so without
Servant:
bawdry, which is strange, with such delicate
Servant:
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
Servant:
her,' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
Servant:
as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
Servant:
the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
Servant:
no harm, good man,' puts him off, slights him, with
Servant:
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'
POLIXENES:
This is a brave fellow.
Clown:
Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
Clown:
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?
Servant:
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow,
Servant:
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
Servant:
learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
Servant:
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
Servant:
sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses, you
Servant:
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
Servant:
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
Clown:
Prithee bring him in, and let him approach singing.
PERDITA:
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.
PERDITA:
Exit Servant
Clown:
You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
Clown:
than you'ld think, sister.
PERDITA:
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
PERDITA:
Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing
AUTOLYCUS:
Lawn as white as driven snow,
AUTOLYCUS:
Cyprus black as e'er was crow,
AUTOLYCUS:
Gloves as sweet as damask roses,
AUTOLYCUS:
Masks for faces and for noses,
AUTOLYCUS:
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
AUTOLYCUS:
Perfume for a lady's chamber,
AUTOLYCUS:
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
AUTOLYCUS:
For my lads to give their dears
AUTOLYCUS:
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
AUTOLYCUS:
What maids lack from head to heel
AUTOLYCUS:
Come buy of me, come, come buy, come buy,
AUTOLYCUS:
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.
Clown:
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
Clown:
no money of me, but being enthralled as I am, it
Clown:
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
MOPSA:
I was promised them against the feast, but they come
MOPSA:
not too late now.
DORCAS:
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
MOPSA:
He hath paid you all he promised you, may be, he has
MOPSA:
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.
Clown:
Is there no manners left among maids? will they
Clown:
wear their plackets where they should bear their
Clown:
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
Clown:
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
Clown:
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
Clown:
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
Clown:
your tongues, and not a word more.
MOPSA:
I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
MOPSA:
and a pair of sweet gloves.
Clown:
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
Clown:
and lost all my money?
AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad,
AUTOLYCUS:
therefore it behoves men to be wary.
Clown:
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.
AUTOLYCUS:
I hope so, sir, for I have about me many parcels of charge.
Clown:
What hast here? ballads?
MOPSA:
Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
MOPSA:
life, for then we are sure they are true.
AUTOLYCUS:
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
AUTOLYCUS:
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
AUTOLYCUS:
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
AUTOLYCUS:
toads carbonadoed.
MOPSA:
Is it true, think you?
AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a month old.
DORCAS:
Bless me from marrying a usurer!
AUTOLYCUS:
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
AUTOLYCUS:
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
AUTOLYCUS:
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
MOPSA:
Pray you now, buy it.
Clown:
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
Clown:
ballads, we'll buy the other things anon.
AUTOLYCUS:
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
AUTOLYCUS:
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
AUTOLYCUS:
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
AUTOLYCUS:
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
AUTOLYCUS:
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
AUTOLYCUS:
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
AUTOLYCUS:
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.
DORCAS:
Is it true too, think you?
AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
AUTOLYCUS:
my pack will hold.
Clown:
Lay it by too: another.
AUTOLYCUS:
This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
MOPSA:
Let's have some merry ones.
AUTOLYCUS:
Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
AUTOLYCUS:
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
AUTOLYCUS:
scarce a maid westward but she sings it, 'tis in
AUTOLYCUS:
request, I can tell you.
MOPSA:
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
MOPSA:
shalt hear, 'tis in three parts.
DORCAS:
We had the tune on't a month ago.
AUTOLYCUS:
I can bear my part, you must know 'tis my
AUTOLYCUS:
occupation, have at it with you.
AUTOLYCUS:
SONG
AUTOLYCUS:
Get you hence, for I must go
AUTOLYCUS:
Where it fits not you to know.
DORCAS:
Whither?
MOPSA:
O, whither?
DORCAS:
Whither?
MOPSA:
It becomes thy oath full well,
MOPSA:
Thou to me thy secrets tell.
DORCAS:
Me too, let me go thither.
MOPSA:
Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
DORCAS:
If to either, thou dost ill.
AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.
DORCAS:
What, neither?
AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.
DORCAS:
Thou hast sworn my love to be.
MOPSA:
Thou hast sworn it more to me
MOPSA:
Then whither goest? say, whither?
Clown:
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
Clown:
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
Clown:
not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
Clown:
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
Clown:
have the first choice. Follow me, girls.
Clown:
Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA
AUTOLYCUS:
And you shall pay well for 'em.
AUTOLYCUS:
Follows singing
AUTOLYCUS:
Will you buy any tape,
AUTOLYCUS:
Or lace for your cape,
AUTOLYCUS:
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
AUTOLYCUS:
Any silk, any thread,
AUTOLYCUS:
Any toys for your head,
AUTOLYCUS:
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
AUTOLYCUS:
Come to the pedlar,
AUTOLYCUS:
Money's a medler.
AUTOLYCUS:
That doth utter all men's ware-a.
AUTOLYCUS:
Exit
AUTOLYCUS:
Re-enter Servant
Servant:
Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
Servant:
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
Servant:
themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
Servant:
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
Servant:
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
Servant:
not in't, but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
Servant:
be not too rough for some that know little but
Servant:
bowling, it will please plentifully.
Shepherd:
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
Shepherd:
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.
POLIXENES:
You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
POLIXENES:
these four threes of herdsmen.
Servant:
One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
Servant:
danced before the king, and not the worst of the
Servant:
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
Shepherd:
Leave your prating: since these good men are
Shepherd:
pleased, let them come in, but quickly now.
Servant:
Why, they stay at door, sir.
Servant:
Exit
Servant:
Here a dance of twelve Satyrs
POLIXENES:
O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
POLIXENES:
To CAMILLO
POLIXENES:
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
POLIXENES:
He's simple and tells much.
POLIXENES:
To FLORIZEL
POLIXENES:
How now, fair shepherd!
POLIXENES:
Your heart is full of something that does take
POLIXENES:
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
POLIXENES:
And handed love as you do, I was wont
POLIXENES:
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
POLIXENES:
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
POLIXENES:
To her acceptance, you have let him go
POLIXENES:
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
POLIXENES:
Interpretation should abuse and call this
POLIXENES:
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
POLIXENES:
For a reply, at least if you make a care
POLIXENES:
Of happy holding her.
FLORIZEL:
Old sir, I know
FLORIZEL:
She prizes not such trifles as these are
FLORIZEL:
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
FLORIZEL:
Up in my heart, which I have given already,
FLORIZEL:
But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
FLORIZEL:
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
FLORIZEL:
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
FLORIZEL:
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
FLORIZEL:
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
FLORIZEL:
snow that's bolted
FLORIZEL:
By the northern blasts twice o'er.
POLIXENES:
What follows this?
POLIXENES:
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
POLIXENES:
The hand was fair before! I have put you out
POLIXENES:
But to your protestation, let me hear
POLIXENES:
What you profess.
FLORIZEL:
Do, and be witness to 't.
POLIXENES:
And this my neighbour too?
FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
FLORIZEL:
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all
FLORIZEL:
That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
FLORIZEL:
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
FLORIZEL:
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
FLORIZEL:
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
FLORIZEL:
Without her love, for her employ them all,
FLORIZEL:
Commend them and condemn them to her service
FLORIZEL:
Or to their own perdition.
POLIXENES:
Fairly offer'd.
CAMILLO:
This shows a sound affection.
Shepherd:
But, my daughter,
Shepherd:
Say you the like to him?
PERDITA:
I cannot speak
PERDITA:
So well, nothing so well, no, nor mean better
PERDITA:
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
PERDITA:
The purity of his.
Shepherd:
Take hands, a bargain!
Shepherd:
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't
Shepherd:
I give my daughter to him, and will make
Shepherd:
Her portion equal his.
FLORIZEL:
O, that must be
FLORIZEL:
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
FLORIZEL:
I shall have more than you can dream of yet,
FLORIZEL:
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
FLORIZEL:
Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
Shepherd:
Come, your hand,
Shepherd:
And, daughter, yours.
POLIXENES:
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you,
POLIXENES:
Have you a father?
FLORIZEL:
I have: but what of him?
POLIXENES:
Knows he of this?
FLORIZEL:
He neither does nor shall.
POLIXENES:
Methinks a father
POLIXENES:
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
POLIXENES:
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
POLIXENES:
Is not your father grown incapable
POLIXENES:
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
POLIXENES:
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
POLIXENES:
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
POLIXENES:
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
POLIXENES:
But what he did being childish?
FLORIZEL:
No, good sir,
FLORIZEL:
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
FLORIZEL:
Than most have of his age.
POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
POLIXENES:
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
POLIXENES:
Something unfilial: reason my son
POLIXENES:
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
POLIXENES:
The father, all whose joy is nothing else
POLIXENES:
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
POLIXENES:
In such a business.
FLORIZEL:
I yield all this,
FLORIZEL:
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
FLORIZEL:
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
FLORIZEL:
My father of this business.
POLIXENES:
Let him know't.
FLORIZEL:
He shall not.
POLIXENES:
Prithee, let him.
FLORIZEL:
No, he must not.
Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
Shepherd:
At knowing of thy choice.
FLORIZEL:
Come, come, he must not.
FLORIZEL:
Mark our contract.
POLIXENES:
Mark your divorce, young sir,
POLIXENES:
Discovering himself
POLIXENES:
Whom son I dare not call, thou art too base
POLIXENES:
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
POLIXENES:
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
POLIXENES:
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
POLIXENES:
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
POLIXENES:
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
POLIXENES:
The royal fool thou copest with,--
Shepherd:
O, my heart!
POLIXENES:
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
POLIXENES:
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
POLIXENES:
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
POLIXENES:
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
POLIXENES:
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession,
POLIXENES:
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
POLIXENES:
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words
POLIXENES:
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
POLIXENES:
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
POLIXENES:
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
POLIXENES:
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
POLIXENES:
That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
POLIXENES:
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
POLIXENES:
These rural latches to his entrance open,
POLIXENES:
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
POLIXENES:
I will devise a death as cruel for thee
POLIXENES:
As thou art tender to't.
POLIXENES:
Exit
PERDITA:
Even here undone!
PERDITA:
I was not much afeard, for once or twice
PERDITA:
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
PERDITA:
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
PERDITA:
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
PERDITA:
Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
PERDITA:
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
PERDITA:
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
PERDITA:
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
PERDITA:
But milk my ewes and weep.
CAMILLO:
Why, how now, father!
CAMILLO:
Speak ere thou diest.
Shepherd:
I cannot speak, nor think
Shepherd:
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
Shepherd:
You have undone a man of fourscore three,
Shepherd:
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
Shepherd:
To die upon the bed my father died,
Shepherd:
To lie close by his honest bones: but now
Shepherd:
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Shepherd:
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
Shepherd:
That knew'st this was the prince,
Shepherd:
and wouldst adventure
Shepherd:
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
Shepherd:
If I might die within this hour, I have lived
Shepherd:
To die when I desire.
Shepherd:
Exit
FLORIZEL:
Why look you so upon me?
FLORIZEL:
I am but sorry, not afeard, delay'd,
FLORIZEL:
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am,
FLORIZEL:
More straining on for plucking back, not following
FLORIZEL:
My leash unwillingly.
CAMILLO:
Gracious my lord,
CAMILLO:
You know your father's temper: at this time
CAMILLO:
He will allow no speech, which I do guess
CAMILLO:
You do not purpose to him, and as hardly
CAMILLO:
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear
CAMILLO:
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
CAMILLO:
Come not before him.
FLORIZEL:
I not purpose it.
FLORIZEL:
I think, Camillo?
CAMILLO:
Even he, my lord.
PERDITA:
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
PERDITA:
How often said, my dignity would last
PERDITA:
But till 'twere known!
FLORIZEL:
It cannot fail but by
FLORIZEL:
The violation of my faith, and then
FLORIZEL:
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
FLORIZEL:
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks
FLORIZEL:
From my succession wipe me, father, I
FLORIZEL:
Am heir to my affection.
CAMILLO:
Be advised.
FLORIZEL:
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
FLORIZEL:
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason,
FLORIZEL:
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
FLORIZEL:
Do bid it welcome.
CAMILLO:
This is desperate, sir.
FLORIZEL:
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow,
FLORIZEL:
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
FLORIZEL:
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
FLORIZEL:
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
FLORIZEL:
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
FLORIZEL:
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
FLORIZEL:
To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
FLORIZEL:
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
FLORIZEL:
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
FLORIZEL:
To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
FLORIZEL:
Upon his passion, let myself and fortune
FLORIZEL:
Tug for the time to come. This you may know
FLORIZEL:
And so deliver, I am put to sea
FLORIZEL:
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore,
FLORIZEL:
And most opportune to our need I have
FLORIZEL:
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
FLORIZEL:
For this design. What course I mean to hold
FLORIZEL:
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
FLORIZEL:
Concern me the reporting.
CAMILLO:
O my lord!
CAMILLO:
I would your spirit were easier for advice,
CAMILLO:
Or stronger for your need.
FLORIZEL:
Hark, Perdita
FLORIZEL:
Drawing her aside
FLORIZEL:
I'll hear you by and by.
CAMILLO:
He's irremoveable,
CAMILLO:
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
CAMILLO:
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
CAMILLO:
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
CAMILLO:
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
CAMILLO:
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
CAMILLO:
I so much thirst to see.
FLORIZEL:
Now, good Camillo,
FLORIZEL:
I am so fraught with curious business that
FLORIZEL:
I leave out ceremony.
CAMILLO:
Sir, I think
CAMILLO:
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
CAMILLO:
That I have borne your father?
FLORIZEL:
Very nobly
FLORIZEL:
Have you deserved: it is my father's music
FLORIZEL:
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
FLORIZEL:
To have them recompensed as thought on.
CAMILLO:
Well, my lord,
CAMILLO:
If you may please to think I love the king
CAMILLO:
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
CAMILLO:
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction
CAMILLO:
If your more ponderous and settled project
CAMILLO:
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
CAMILLO:
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
CAMILLO:
As shall become your highness, where you may
CAMILLO:
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
CAMILLO:
There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
CAMILLO:
As heavens forefend!--your ruin, marry her,
CAMILLO:
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
CAMILLO:
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
CAMILLO:
And bring him up to liking.
FLORIZEL:
How, Camillo,
FLORIZEL:
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
FLORIZEL:
That I may call thee something more than man
FLORIZEL:
And after that trust to thee.
CAMILLO:
Have you thought on
CAMILLO:
A place whereto you'll go?
FLORIZEL:
Not any yet
FLORIZEL:
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
FLORIZEL:
To what we wildly do, so we profess
FLORIZEL:
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
FLORIZEL:
Of every wind that blows.
CAMILLO:
Then list to me
CAMILLO:
This follows, if you will not change your purpose
CAMILLO:
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
CAMILLO:
And there present yourself and your fair princess,
CAMILLO:
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes
CAMILLO:
She shall be habited as it becomes
CAMILLO:
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
CAMILLO:
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
CAMILLO:
His welcomes forth, asks thee the son forgiveness,
CAMILLO:
As 'twere i' the father's person, kisses the hands
CAMILLO:
Of your fresh princess, o'er and o'er divides him
CAMILLO:
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness, the one
CAMILLO:
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
CAMILLO:
Faster than thought or time.
FLORIZEL:
Worthy Camillo,
FLORIZEL:
What colour for my visitation shall I
FLORIZEL:
Hold up before him?
CAMILLO:
Sent by the king your father
CAMILLO:
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
CAMILLO:
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
CAMILLO:
What you as from your father shall deliver,
CAMILLO:
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down
CAMILLO:
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
CAMILLO:
What you must say, that he shall not perceive
CAMILLO:
But that you have your father's bosom there
CAMILLO:
And speak his very heart.
FLORIZEL:
I am bound to you
FLORIZEL:
There is some sap in this.
CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
CAMILLO:
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
CAMILLO:
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
CAMILLO:
To miseries enough, no hope to help you,
CAMILLO:
But as you shake off one to take another,
CAMILLO:
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
CAMILLO:
Do their best office, if they can but stay you
CAMILLO:
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
CAMILLO:
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
CAMILLO:
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
CAMILLO:
Affliction alters.
PERDITA:
One of these is true
PERDITA:
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
PERDITA:
But not take in the mind.
CAMILLO:
Yea, say you so?
CAMILLO:
There shall not at your father's house these
CAMILLO:
seven years
CAMILLO:
Be born another such.
FLORIZEL:
My good Camillo,
FLORIZEL:
She is as forward of her breeding as
FLORIZEL:
She is i' the rear our birth.
CAMILLO:
I cannot say 'tis pity
CAMILLO:
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
CAMILLO:
To most that teach.
PERDITA:
Your pardon, sir, for this
PERDITA:
I'll blush you thanks.
FLORIZEL:
My prettiest Perdita!
FLORIZEL:
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
FLORIZEL:
Preserver of my father, now of me,
FLORIZEL:
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
FLORIZEL:
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
FLORIZEL:
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
CAMILLO:
My lord,
CAMILLO:
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
CAMILLO:
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
CAMILLO:
To have you royally appointed as if
CAMILLO:
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
CAMILLO:
That you may know you shall not want, one word.
CAMILLO:
They talk aside
CAMILLO:
Re-enter AUTOLYCUS
AUTOLYCUS:
Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
AUTOLYCUS:
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
AUTOLYCUS:
all my trumpery, not a counterfeit stone, not a
AUTOLYCUS:
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
AUTOLYCUS:
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
AUTOLYCUS:
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
AUTOLYCUS:
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
AUTOLYCUS:
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer
AUTOLYCUS:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
AUTOLYCUS:
picture, and what I saw, to my good use I
AUTOLYCUS:
remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
AUTOLYCUS:
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
AUTOLYCUS:
wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
AUTOLYCUS:
till he had both tune and words, which so drew the
AUTOLYCUS:
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
AUTOLYCUS:
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
AUTOLYCUS:
was senseless, 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
AUTOLYCUS:
purse, I could have filed keys off that hung in
AUTOLYCUS:
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
AUTOLYCUS:
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
AUTOLYCUS:
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
AUTOLYCUS:
festival purses, and had not the old man come in
AUTOLYCUS:
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
AUTOLYCUS:
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
AUTOLYCUS:
left a purse alive in the whole army.
AUTOLYCUS:
CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward
CAMILLO:
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
CAMILLO:
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
FLORIZEL:
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
CAMILLO:
Shall satisfy your father.
PERDITA:
Happy be you!
PERDITA:
All that you speak shows fair.
CAMILLO:
Who have we here?
CAMILLO:
Seeing AUTOLYCUS
CAMILLO:
We'll make an instrument of this, omit
CAMILLO:
Nothing may give us aid.
AUTOLYCUS:
If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.
CAMILLO:
How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
CAMILLO:
not, man, here's no harm intended to thee.
AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.
CAMILLO:
Why, be so still, here's nobody will steal that from
CAMILLO:
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
CAMILLO:
make an exchange, therefore discase thee instantly,
CAMILLO:
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
CAMILLO:
change garments with this gentleman: though the
CAMILLO:
pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
CAMILLO:
there's some boot.
AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.
AUTOLYCUS:
Aside
AUTOLYCUS:
I know ye well enough.
CAMILLO:
Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
CAMILLO:
flayed already.
AUTOLYCUS:
Are you in earnest, sir?
AUTOLYCUS:
Aside
AUTOLYCUS:
I smell the trick on't.
FLORIZEL:
Dispatch, I prithee.
AUTOLYCUS:
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
AUTOLYCUS:
conscience take it.
CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
CAMILLO:
FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments
CAMILLO:
Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
CAMILLO:
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
CAMILLO:
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
CAMILLO:
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
CAMILLO:
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
CAMILLO:
The truth of your own seeming, that you may--
CAMILLO:
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
CAMILLO:
Get undescried.
PERDITA:
I see the play so lies
PERDITA:
That I must bear a part.
CAMILLO:
No remedy.
CAMILLO:
Have you done there?
FLORIZEL:
Should I now meet my father,
FLORIZEL:
He would not call me son.
CAMILLO:
Nay, you shall have no hat.
CAMILLO:
Giving it to PERDITA
CAMILLO:
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.
AUTOLYCUS:
Adieu, sir.
FLORIZEL:
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
FLORIZEL:
Pray you, a word.
CAMILLO:
[Aside]  What I do next, shall be to tell the king
CAMILLO:
Of this escape and whither they are bound,
CAMILLO:
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
CAMILLO:
To force him after: in whose company
CAMILLO:
I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight
CAMILLO:
I have a woman's longing.
FLORIZEL:
Fortune speed us!
FLORIZEL:
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.
CAMILLO:
The swifter speed the better.
CAMILLO:
Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO
AUTOLYCUS:
I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
AUTOLYCUS:
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
AUTOLYCUS:
necessary for a cut-purse, a good nose is requisite
AUTOLYCUS:
also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
AUTOLYCUS:
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
AUTOLYCUS:
What an exchange had this been without boot! What
AUTOLYCUS:
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
AUTOLYCUS:
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
AUTOLYCUS:
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
AUTOLYCUS:
iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
AUTOLYCUS:
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
AUTOLYCUS:
honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
AUTOLYCUS:
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it,
AUTOLYCUS:
and therein am I constant to my profession.
AUTOLYCUS:
Re-enter Clown and Shepherd
AUTOLYCUS:
Aside, aside, here is more matter for a hot brain
AUTOLYCUS:
every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
AUTOLYCUS:
hanging, yields a careful man work.
Clown:
See, see, what a man you are now!
Clown:
There is no other way but to tell the king
Clown:
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
Shepherd:
Nay, but hear me.
Clown:
Nay, but hear me.
Shepherd:
Go to, then.
Clown:
She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
Clown:
and blood has not offended the king, and so your
Clown:
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
Clown:
those things you found about her, those secret
Clown:
things, all but what she has with her: this being
Clown:
done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.
Shepherd:
I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
Shepherd:
son's pranks too, who, I may say, is no honest man,
Shepherd:
neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
Shepherd:
me the king's brother-in-law.
Clown:
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
Clown:
could have been to him and then your blood had been
Clown:
the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
AUTOLYCUS:
[Aside]  Very wisely, puppies!
Shepherd:
Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
Shepherd:
fardel will make him scratch his beard.
AUTOLYCUS:
[Aside]  I know not what impediment this complaint
AUTOLYCUS:
may be to the flight of my master.
Clown:
Pray heartily he be at palace.
AUTOLYCUS:
[Aside]  Though I am not naturally honest, I am so
AUTOLYCUS:
sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.
AUTOLYCUS:
Takes off his false beard
AUTOLYCUS:
How now, rustics! whither are you bound?
Shepherd:
To the palace, an it like your worship.
AUTOLYCUS:
Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
AUTOLYCUS:
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
AUTOLYCUS:
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
AUTOLYCUS:
thing that is fitting to be known, discover.
Clown:
We are but plain fellows, sir.
AUTOLYCUS:
A lie, you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
AUTOLYCUS:
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
AUTOLYCUS:
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
AUTOLYCUS:
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel, therefore
AUTOLYCUS:
they do not give us the lie.
Clown:
Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
Clown:
had not taken yourself with the manner.
Shepherd:
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?
AUTOLYCUS:
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
AUTOLYCUS:
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
AUTOLYCUS:
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
AUTOLYCUS:
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
AUTOLYCUS:
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
AUTOLYCUS:
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
AUTOLYCUS:
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
AUTOLYCUS:
cap-a-pe, and one that will either push on or pluck
AUTOLYCUS:
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
AUTOLYCUS:
open thy affair.
Shepherd:
My business, sir, is to the king.
AUTOLYCUS:
What advocate hast thou to him?
Shepherd:
I know not, an't like you.
Clown:
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
Clown:
have none.
Shepherd:
None, sir, I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
AUTOLYCUS:
How blessed are we that are not simple men!
AUTOLYCUS:
Yet nature might have made me as these are,
AUTOLYCUS:
Therefore I will not disdain.
Clown:
This cannot be but a great courtier.
Shepherd:
His garments are rich, but he wears
Shepherd:
them not handsomely.
Clown:
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical
Clown:
a great man, I'll warrant, I know by the picking
Clown:
on's teeth.
AUTOLYCUS:
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
AUTOLYCUS:
Wherefore that box?
Shepherd:
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
Shepherd:
which none must know but the king, and which he
Shepherd:
shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
Shepherd:
speech of him.
AUTOLYCUS:
Age, thou hast lost thy labour.
Shepherd:
Why, sir?
AUTOLYCUS:
The king is not at the palace, he is gone aboard a
AUTOLYCUS:
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
AUTOLYCUS:
if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
AUTOLYCUS:
know the king is full of grief.
Shepard:
So 'tis said, sir, about his son, that should have
Shepard:
married a shepherd's daughter.
AUTOLYCUS:
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly
AUTOLYCUS:
the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
AUTOLYCUS:
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.
Clown:
Think you so, sir?
AUTOLYCUS:
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
AUTOLYCUS:
and vengeance bitter, but those that are germane to
AUTOLYCUS:
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
AUTOLYCUS:
under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
AUTOLYCUS:
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
AUTOLYCUS:
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
AUTOLYCUS:
grace! Some say he shall be stoned, but that death
AUTOLYCUS:
is too soft for him, say I	draw our throne into a
AUTOLYCUS:
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.
Clown:
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
Clown:
like you, sir?
AUTOLYCUS:
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive, then
AUTOLYCUS:
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
AUTOLYCUS:
wasp's nest, then stand till he be three quarters
AUTOLYCUS:
and a dram dead, then recovered again with
AUTOLYCUS:
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion, then, raw as
AUTOLYCUS:
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
AUTOLYCUS:
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
AUTOLYCUS:
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
AUTOLYCUS:
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
AUTOLYCUS:
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
AUTOLYCUS:
are to be smiled at, their offences being so
AUTOLYCUS:
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
AUTOLYCUS:
men, what you have to the king: being something
AUTOLYCUS:
gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
AUTOLYCUS:
aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
AUTOLYCUS:
whisper him in your behalfs, and if it be in man
AUTOLYCUS:
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
AUTOLYCUS:
shall do it.
Clown:
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
Clown:
give him gold, and though authority be a stubborn
Clown:
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
Clown:
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
Clown:
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'
Shepherd:
An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
Shepherd:
us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much
Shepherd:
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.
AUTOLYCUS:
After I have done what I promised?
Shepherd:
Ay, sir.
AUTOLYCUS:
Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?
Clown:
In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
Clown:
one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.
AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
AUTOLYCUS:
he'll be made an example.
Clown:
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
Clown:
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
Clown:
daughter nor my sister, we are gone else. Sir, I
Clown:
will give you as much as this old man does when the
Clown:
business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
Clown:
pawn till it be brought you.
AUTOLYCUS:
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side,
AUTOLYCUS:
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
AUTOLYCUS:
hedge and follow you.
Clown:
We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.
Shepherd:
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
Shepherd:
Exeunt Shepherd and Clown
AUTOLYCUS:
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
AUTOLYCUS:
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
AUTOLYCUS:
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
AUTOLYCUS:
to do the prince my master good, which who knows how
AUTOLYCUS:
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
AUTOLYCUS:
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
AUTOLYCUS:
think it fit to shore them again and that the
AUTOLYCUS:
complaint they have to the king concerns him
AUTOLYCUS:
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
AUTOLYCUS:
officious, for I am proof against that title and
AUTOLYCUS:
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
AUTOLYCUS:
them: there may be matter in it.
AUTOLYCUS:
Exit
AUTOLYCUS:
ACT V
AUTOLYCUS:
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
AUTOLYCUS:
Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants
CLEOMENES:
Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
CLEOMENES:
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
CLEOMENES:
Which you have not redeem'd, indeed, paid down
CLEOMENES:
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
CLEOMENES:
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil,
CLEOMENES:
With them forgive yourself.
LEONTES:
Whilst I remember
LEONTES:
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
LEONTES:
My blemishes in them, and so still think of
LEONTES:
The wrong I did myself, which was so much,
LEONTES:
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
LEONTES:
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
LEONTES:
Bred his hopes out of.
PAULINA:
True, too true, my lord
PAULINA:
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
PAULINA:
Or from the all that are took something good,
PAULINA:
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
PAULINA:
Would be unparallel'd.
LEONTES:
I think so. Kill'd!
LEONTES:
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
LEONTES:
Sorely, to say I did, it is as bitter
LEONTES:
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
LEONTES:
Say so but seldom.
CLEOMENES:
Not at all, good lady
CLEOMENES:
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
CLEOMENES:
Have done the time more benefit and graced
CLEOMENES:
Your kindness better.
PAULINA:
You are one of those
PAULINA:
Would have him wed again.
DION:
If you would not so,
DION:
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
DION:
Of his most sovereign name, consider little
DION:
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
DION:
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
DION:
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
DION:
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
DION:
What holier than, for royalty's repair,
DION:
For present comfort and for future good,
DION:
To bless the bed of majesty again
DION:
With a sweet fellow to't?
PAULINA:
There is none worthy,
PAULINA:
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
PAULINA:
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes,
PAULINA:
For has not the divine Apollo said,
PAULINA:
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
PAULINA:
That King Leontes shall not have an heir
PAULINA:
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
PAULINA:
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
PAULINA:
As my Antigonus to break his grave
PAULINA:
And come again to me, who, on my life,
PAULINA:
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
PAULINA:
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
PAULINA:
Oppose against their wills.
PAULINA:
To LEONTES
PAULINA:
Care not for issue,
PAULINA:
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
PAULINA:
Left his to the worthiest, so his successor
PAULINA:
Was like to be the best.
LEONTES:
Good Paulina,
LEONTES:
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
LEONTES:
I know, in honour, O, that ever I
LEONTES:
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
LEONTES:
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
LEONTES:
Have taken treasure from her lips--
PAULINA:
And left them
PAULINA:
More rich for what they yielded.
LEONTES:
Thou speak'st truth.
LEONTES:
No more such wives, therefore, no wife: one worse,
LEONTES:
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
LEONTES:
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
LEONTES:
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
LEONTES:
And begin, 'Why to me?'
PAULINA:
Had she such power,
PAULINA:
She had just cause.
LEONTES:
She had, and would incense me
LEONTES:
To murder her I married.
PAULINA:
I should so.
PAULINA:
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
PAULINA:
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
PAULINA:
You chose her, then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
PAULINA:
Should rift to hear me, and the words that follow'd
PAULINA:
Should be 'Remember mine.'
LEONTES:
Stars, stars,
LEONTES:
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife,
LEONTES:
I'll have no wife, Paulina.
PAULINA:
Will you swear
PAULINA:
Never to marry but by my free leave?
LEONTES:
Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit!
PAULINA:
Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
CLEOMENES:
You tempt him over-much.
PAULINA:
Unless another,
PAULINA:
As like Hermione as is her picture,
PAULINA:
Affront his eye.
CLEOMENES:
Good madam,--
PAULINA:
I have done.
PAULINA:
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
PAULINA:
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
PAULINA:
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
PAULINA:
As was your former, but she shall be such
PAULINA:
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
PAULINA:
it should take joy
PAULINA:
To see her in your arms.
LEONTES:
My true Paulina,
LEONTES:
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
PAULINA:
That
PAULINA:
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath,
PAULINA:
Never till then.
PAULINA:
Enter a Gentleman
Gentleman:
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
Gentleman:
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
Gentleman:
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
Gentleman:
To your high presence.
LEONTES:
What with him? he comes not
LEONTES:
Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
LEONTES:
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
LEONTES:
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
LEONTES:
By need and accident. What train?
Gentleman:
But few,
Gentleman:
And those but mean.
LEONTES:
His princess, say you, with him?
Gentleman:
Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
Gentleman:
That e'er the sun shone bright on.
PAULINA:
O Hermione,
PAULINA:
As every present time doth boast itself
PAULINA:
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
PAULINA:
Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
PAULINA:
Have said and writ so, but your writing now
PAULINA:
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
PAULINA:
Nor was not to be equall'd,'--thus your verse
PAULINA:
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
PAULINA:
To say you have seen a better.
Gentleman:
Pardon, madam
Gentleman:
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
Gentleman:
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
Gentleman:
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
Gentleman:
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Gentleman:
Of all professors else, make proselytes
Gentleman:
Of who she but bid follow.
PAULINA:
How! not women?
Gentleman:
Women will love her, that she is a woman
Gentleman:
More worth than any man, men, that she is
Gentleman:
The rarest of all women.
LEONTES:
Go, Cleomenes,
LEONTES:
Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
LEONTES:
Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
LEONTES:
Exeunt CLEOMENES and others
LEONTES:
He thus should steal upon us.
PAULINA:
Had our prince,
PAULINA:
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
PAULINA:
Well with this lord: there was not full a month
PAULINA:
Between their births.
LEONTES:
Prithee, no more, cease, thou know'st
LEONTES:
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
LEONTES:
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
LEONTES:
Will bring me to consider that which may
LEONTES:
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
LEONTES:
Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA
LEONTES:
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,
LEONTES:
For she did print your royal father off,
LEONTES:
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
LEONTES:
Your father's image is so hit in you,
LEONTES:
His very air, that I should call you brother,
LEONTES:
As I did him, and speak of something wildly
LEONTES:
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
LEONTES:
And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
LEONTES:
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
LEONTES:
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
LEONTES:
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
LEONTES:
All mine own folly--the society,
LEONTES:
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
LEONTES:
Though bearing misery, I desire my life
LEONTES:
Once more to look on him.
FLORIZEL:
By his command
FLORIZEL:
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
FLORIZEL:
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
FLORIZEL:
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
FLORIZEL:
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
FLORIZEL:
His wish'd ability, he had himself
FLORIZEL:
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
FLORIZEL:
Measured to look upon you, whom he loves--
FLORIZEL:
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
FLORIZEL:
And those that bear them living.
LEONTES:
O my brother,
LEONTES:
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
LEONTES:
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
LEONTES:
So rarely kind, are as interpreters
LEONTES:
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
LEONTES:
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
LEONTES:
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
LEONTES:
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
LEONTES:
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
LEONTES:
The adventure of her person?
FLORIZEL:
Good my lord,
FLORIZEL:
She came from Libya.
LEONTES:
Where the warlike Smalus,
LEONTES:
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
FLORIZEL:
Most royal sir, from thence, from him, whose daughter
FLORIZEL:
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
FLORIZEL:
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
FLORIZEL:
To execute the charge my father gave me
FLORIZEL:
For visiting your highness: my best train
FLORIZEL:
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd,
FLORIZEL:
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
FLORIZEL:
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
FLORIZEL:
But my arrival and my wife's in safety
FLORIZEL:
Here where we are.
LEONTES:
The blessed gods
LEONTES:
Purge all infection from our air whilst you
LEONTES:
Do climate here! You have a holy father,
LEONTES:
A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
LEONTES:
So sacred as it is, I have done sin
LEONTES:
For which the heavens, taking angry note,
LEONTES:
Have left me issueless, and your father's blest,
LEONTES:
As he from heaven merits it, with you
LEONTES:
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
LEONTES:
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
LEONTES:
Such goodly things as you!
LEONTES:
Enter a Lord
Lord:
Most noble sir,
Lord:
That which I shall report will bear no credit,
Lord:
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
Lord:
Bohemia greets you from himself by me,
Lord:
Desires you to attach his son, who has--
Lord:
His dignity and duty both cast off--
Lord:
Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
Lord:
A shepherd's daughter.
LEONTES:
Where's Bohemia? speak.
Lord:
Here in your city, I now came from him
Lord:
I speak amazedly, and it becomes
Lord:
My marvel and my message. To your court
Lord:
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
Lord:
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
Lord:
The father of this seeming lady and
Lord:
Her brother, having both their country quitted
Lord:
With this young prince.
FLORIZEL:
Camillo has betray'd me,
FLORIZEL:
Whose honour and whose honesty till now
FLORIZEL:
Endured all weathers.
Lord:
Lay't so to his charge
Lord:
He's with the king your father.
LEONTES:
Who? Camillo?
Lord:
Camillo, sir, I spake with him, who now
Lord:
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Lord:
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth,
Lord:
Forswear themselves as often as they speak
Lord:
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
Lord:
With divers deaths in death.
PERDITA:
O my poor father!
PERDITA:
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
PERDITA:
Our contract celebrated.
LEONTES:
You are married?
FLORIZEL:
We are not, sir, nor are we like to be,
FLORIZEL:
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first
FLORIZEL:
The odds for high and low's alike.
LEONTES:
My lord,
LEONTES:
Is this the daughter of a king?
FLORIZEL:
She is,
FLORIZEL:
When once she is my wife.
LEONTES:
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
LEONTES:
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
LEONTES:
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
LEONTES:
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
LEONTES:
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
LEONTES:
That you might well enjoy her.
FLORIZEL:
Dear, look up
FLORIZEL:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
FLORIZEL:
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
FLORIZEL:
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
FLORIZEL:
Remember since you owed no more to time
FLORIZEL:
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
FLORIZEL:
Step forth mine advocate, at your request
FLORIZEL:
My father will grant precious things as trifles.
LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
LEONTES:
Which he counts but a trifle.
PAULINA:
Sir, my liege,
PAULINA:
Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
PAULINA:
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
PAULINA:
Than what you look on now.
LEONTES:
I thought of her,
LEONTES:
Even in these looks I made.
LEONTES:
To FLORIZEL
LEONTES:
But your petition
LEONTES:
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father
LEONTES:
Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
LEONTES:
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
LEONTES:
I now go toward him, therefore follow me
LEONTES:
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.
LEONTES:
Exeunt
LEONTES:
SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.
LEONTES:
Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman
AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
First Gentleman:
I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
First Gentleman:
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it
First Gentleman:
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
First Gentleman:
commanded out of the chamber, only this methought I
First Gentleman:
heard the shepherd say, he found the child.
AUTOLYCUS:
I would most gladly know the issue of it.
First Gentleman:
I make a broken delivery of the business, but the
First Gentleman:
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
First Gentleman:
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
First Gentleman:
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
First Gentleman:
eyes, there was speech in their dumbness, language
First Gentleman:
in their very gesture, they looked as they had heard
First Gentleman:
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
First Gentleman:
passion of wonder appeared in them, but the wisest
First Gentleman:
beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
First Gentleman:
say if the importance were joy or sorrow, but in the
First Gentleman:
extremity of the one, it must needs be.
First Gentleman:
Enter another Gentleman
First Gentleman:
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
First Gentleman:
The news, Rogero?
Second Gentleman:
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled, the
Second Gentleman:
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
Second Gentleman:
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
Second Gentleman:
cannot be able to express it.
Second Gentleman:
Enter a third Gentleman
Second Gentleman:
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
Second Gentleman:
deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
Second Gentleman:
which is called true is so like an old tale, that
Second Gentleman:
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
Second Gentleman:
found his heir?
Third Gentleman:
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
Third Gentleman:
circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
Third Gentleman:
see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
Third Gentleman:
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
Third Gentleman:
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
Third Gentleman:
know to be his character, the majesty of the
Third Gentleman:
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
Third Gentleman:
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
Third Gentleman:
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
Third Gentleman:
certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
Third Gentleman:
the meeting of the two kings?
Second Gentleman:
No.
Third Gentleman:
Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
Third Gentleman:
cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
Third Gentleman:
joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
Third Gentleman:
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
Third Gentleman:
joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
Third Gentleman:
holding up of hands, with countenances of such
Third Gentleman:
distraction that they were to be known by garment,
Third Gentleman:
not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
Third Gentleman:
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
Third Gentleman:
joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
Third Gentleman:
thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness, then
Third Gentleman:
embraces his son-in-law, then again worries he his
Third Gentleman:
daughter with clipping her, now he thanks the old
Third Gentleman:
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
Third Gentleman:
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
Third Gentleman:
another encounter, which lames report to follow it
Third Gentleman:
and undoes description to do it.
Second Gentleman:
What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
Second Gentleman:
hence the child?
Third Gentleman:
Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
Third Gentleman:
rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
Third Gentleman:
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
Third Gentleman:
avouches the shepherd's son, who has not only his
Third Gentleman:
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
Third Gentleman:
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
First Gentleman:
What became of his bark and his followers?
Third Gentleman:
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
Third Gentleman:
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
Third Gentleman:
instruments which aided to expose the child were
Third Gentleman:
even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
Third Gentleman:
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Third Gentleman:
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
Third Gentleman:
her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
Third Gentleman:
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
Third Gentleman:
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
Third Gentleman:
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
Third Gentleman:
of losing.
First Gentleman:
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
First Gentleman:
kings and princes, for by such was it acted.
Third Gentleman:
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
Third Gentleman:
angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
Third Gentleman:
the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
Third Gentleman:
death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
Third Gentleman:
confessed and lamented by the king, how
Third Gentleman:
attentiveness wounded his daughter, till, from one
Third Gentleman:
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
Third Gentleman:
I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
Third Gentleman:
heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
Third Gentleman:
colour, some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
Third Gentleman:
could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.
First Gentleman:
Are they returned to the court?
Third Gentleman:
No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
Third Gentleman:
which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
Third Gentleman:
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
Third Gentleman:
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
Third Gentleman:
eternity and could put breath into his work, would
Third Gentleman:
beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
Third Gentleman:
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
Third Gentleman:
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
Third Gentleman:
answer: thither with all greediness of affection
Third Gentleman:
are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
Second Gentleman:
I thought she had some great matter there in hand,
Second Gentleman:
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
Second Gentleman:
since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
Second Gentleman:
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
Second Gentleman:
the rejoicing?
First Gentleman:
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
First Gentleman:
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born
First Gentleman:
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
First Gentleman:
Let's along.
First Gentleman:
Exeunt Gentlemen
AUTOLYCUS:
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
AUTOLYCUS:
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
AUTOLYCUS:
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
AUTOLYCUS:
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
AUTOLYCUS:
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
AUTOLYCUS:
so he then took her to be, who began to be much
AUTOLYCUS:
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
AUTOLYCUS:
weather continuing, this mystery remained
AUTOLYCUS:
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me, for had I
AUTOLYCUS:
been the finder out of this secret, it would not
AUTOLYCUS:
have relished among my other discredits.
AUTOLYCUS:
Enter Shepherd and Clown
AUTOLYCUS:
Here come those I have done good to against my will,
AUTOLYCUS:
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
Shepherd:
Come, boy, I am past moe children, but thy sons and
Shepherd:
daughters will be all gentlemen born.
Clown:
You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
Clown:
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
Clown:
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
Clown:
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
Clown:
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
Clown:
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.
AUTOLYCUS:
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
Clown:
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.
Shepherd:
And so have I, boy.
Clown:
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
Clown:
father, for the king's son took me by the hand, and
Clown:
called me brother, and then the two kings called my
Clown:
father brother, and then the prince my brother and
Clown:
the princess my sister called my father father, and
Clown:
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
Clown:
tears that ever we shed.
Shepherd:
We may live, son, to shed many more.
Clown:
Ay, or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
Clown:
preposterous estate as we are.
AUTOLYCUS:
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
AUTOLYCUS:
faults I have committed to your worship and to give
AUTOLYCUS:
me your good report to the prince my master.
Shepherd:
Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle, now we are
Shepherd:
gentlemen.
Clown:
Thou wilt amend thy life?
AUTOLYCUS:
Ay, an it like your good worship.
Clown:
Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
Clown:
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
Shepherd:
You may say it, but not swear it.
Clown:
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
Clown:
franklins say it, I'll swear it.
Shepherd:
How if it be false, son?
Clown:
If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
Clown:
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
Clown:
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
Clown:
that thou wilt not be drunk, but I know thou art no
Clown:
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
Clown:
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
Clown:
be a tall fellow of thy hands.
AUTOLYCUS:
I will prove so, sir, to my power.
Clown:
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
Clown:
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
Clown:
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
Clown:
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
Clown:
queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
Clown:
good masters.
Clown:
Exeunt
Clown:
SCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.
Clown:
Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants
LEONTES:
O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
LEONTES:
That I have had of thee!
PAULINA:
What, sovereign sir,
PAULINA:
I did not well I meant well. All my services
PAULINA:
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
PAULINA:
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
PAULINA:
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
PAULINA:
It is a surplus of your grace, which never
PAULINA:
My life may last to answer.
LEONTES:
O Paulina,
LEONTES:
We honour you with trouble: but we came
LEONTES:
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
LEONTES:
Have we pass'd through, not without much content
LEONTES:
In many singularities, but we saw not
LEONTES:
That which my daughter came to look upon,
LEONTES:
The statue of her mother.
PAULINA:
As she lived peerless,
PAULINA:
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
PAULINA:
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
PAULINA:
Or hand of man hath done, therefore I keep it
PAULINA:
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
PAULINA:
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
PAULINA:
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
PAULINA:
PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue
PAULINA:
I like your silence, it the more shows off
PAULINA:
Your wonder: but yet speak, first, you, my liege,
PAULINA:
Comes it not something near?
LEONTES:
Her natural posture!
LEONTES:
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
LEONTES:
Thou art Hermione, or rather, thou art she
LEONTES:
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
LEONTES:
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
LEONTES:
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
LEONTES:
So aged as this seems.
POLIXENES:
O, not by much.
PAULINA:
So much the more our carver's excellence,
PAULINA:
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
PAULINA:
As she lived now.
LEONTES:
As now she might have done,
LEONTES:
So much to my good comfort, as it is
LEONTES:
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
LEONTES:
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
LEONTES:
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
LEONTES:
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
LEONTES:
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
LEONTES:
There's magic in thy majesty, which has
LEONTES:
My evils conjured to remembrance and
LEONTES:
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
LEONTES:
Standing like stone with thee.
PERDITA:
And give me leave,
PERDITA:
And do not say 'tis superstition, that
PERDITA:
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
PERDITA:
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
PERDITA:
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
PAULINA:
O, patience!
PAULINA:
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.
CAMILLO:
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
CAMILLO:
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
CAMILLO:
So many summers dry, scarce any joy
CAMILLO:
Did ever so long live, no sorrow
CAMILLO:
But kill'd itself much sooner.
POLIXENES:
Dear my brother,
POLIXENES:
Let him that was the cause of this have power
POLIXENES:
To take off so much grief from you as he
POLIXENES:
Will piece up in himself.
PAULINA:
Indeed, my lord,
PAULINA:
If I had thought the sight of my poor image
PAULINA:
Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
PAULINA:
I'ld not have show'd it.
LEONTES:
Do not draw the curtain.
PAULINA:
No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
PAULINA:
May think anon it moves.
LEONTES:
Let be, let be.
LEONTES:
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
LEONTES:
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
LEONTES:
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
LEONTES:
Did verily bear blood?
POLIXENES:
Masterly done
POLIXENES:
The very life seems warm upon her lip.
LEONTES:
The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
LEONTES:
As we are mock'd with art.
PAULINA:
I'll draw the curtain
PAULINA:
My lord's almost so far transported that
PAULINA:
He'll think anon it lives.
LEONTES:
O sweet Paulina,
LEONTES:
Make me to think so twenty years together!
LEONTES:
No settled senses of the world can match
LEONTES:
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
PAULINA:
I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
PAULINA:
I could afflict you farther.
LEONTES:
Do, Paulina,
LEONTES:
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
LEONTES:
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
LEONTES:
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
LEONTES:
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
LEONTES:
For I will kiss her.
PAULINA:
Good my lord, forbear
PAULINA:
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet,
PAULINA:
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
PAULINA:
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
LEONTES:
No, not these twenty years.
PERDITA:
So long could I
PERDITA:
Stand by, a looker on.
PAULINA:
Either forbear,
PAULINA:
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
PAULINA:
For more amazement. If you can behold it,
PAULINA:
I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
PAULINA:
And take you by the hand, but then you'll think--
PAULINA:
Which I protest against--I am assisted
PAULINA:
By wicked powers.
LEONTES:
What you can make her do,
LEONTES:
I am content to look on: what to speak,
LEONTES:
I am content to hear, for 'tis as easy
LEONTES:
To make her speak as move.
PAULINA:
It is required
PAULINA:
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still,
PAULINA:
On: those that think it is unlawful business
PAULINA:
I am about, let them depart.
LEONTES:
Proceed
LEONTES:
No foot shall stir.
PAULINA:
Music, awake her, strike!
PAULINA:
Music
PAULINA:
'Tis time, descend, be stone no more, approach,
PAULINA:
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
PAULINA:
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
PAULINA:
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
PAULINA:
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs
PAULINA:
HERMIONE comes down
PAULINA:
Start not, her actions shall be holy as
PAULINA:
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
PAULINA:
Until you see her die again, for then
PAULINA:
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand
PAULINA:
When she was young you woo'd her, now in age
PAULINA:
Is she become the suitor?
LEONTES:
O, she's warm!
LEONTES:
If this be magic, let it be an art
LEONTES:
Lawful as eating.
POLIXENES:
She embraces him.
CAMILLO:
She hangs about his neck
CAMILLO:
If she pertain to life let her speak too.
POLIXENES:
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
POLIXENES:
Or how stolen from the dead.
PAULINA:
That she is living,
PAULINA:
Were it but told you, should be hooted at
PAULINA:
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
PAULINA:
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
PAULINA:
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
PAULINA:
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady,
PAULINA:
Our Perdita is found.
HERMIONE:
You gods, look down
HERMIONE:
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
HERMIONE:
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
HERMIONE:
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
HERMIONE:
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
HERMIONE:
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
HERMIONE:
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
HERMIONE:
Myself to see the issue.
PAULINA:
There's time enough for that,
PAULINA:
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
PAULINA:
Your joys with like relation. Go together,
PAULINA:
You precious winners all, your exultation
PAULINA:
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
PAULINA:
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
PAULINA:
My mate, that's never to be found again,
PAULINA:
Lament till I am lost.
LEONTES:
O, peace, Paulina!
LEONTES:
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
LEONTES:
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
LEONTES:
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine,
LEONTES:
But how, is to be question'd, for I saw her,
LEONTES:
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
LEONTES:
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
LEONTES:
For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
LEONTES:
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
LEONTES:
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
LEONTES:
Is richly noted and here justified
LEONTES:
By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
LEONTES:
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
LEONTES:
That e'er I put between your holy looks
LEONTES:
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
LEONTES:
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
LEONTES:
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
LEONTES:
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
LEONTES:
Each one demand an answer to his part
LEONTES:
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
LEONTES:
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
LEONTES:
Exeunt
