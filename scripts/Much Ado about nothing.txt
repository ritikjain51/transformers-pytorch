PUCK:
ACT I
PUCK:
SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.
PUCK:
Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger
LEONATO:
I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
LEONATO:
comes this night to Messina.
Messenger:
He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
Messenger:
when I left him.
LEONATO:
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
Messenger:
But few of any sort, and none of name.
LEONATO:
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
LEONATO:
home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
LEONATO:
bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
Messenger:
Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
Messenger:
Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
Messenger:
promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
Messenger:
the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
Messenger:
bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
Messenger:
tell you how.
LEONATO:
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
LEONATO:
glad of it.
Messenger:
I have already delivered him letters, and there
Messenger:
appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could
Messenger:
not show itself modest enough without a badge of
Messenger:
bitterness.
LEONATO:
Did he break out into tears?
Messenger:
In great measure.
LEONATO:
A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
LEONATO:
truer than those that are so washed. How much
LEONATO:
better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
BEATRICE:
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
BEATRICE:
wars or no?
Messenger:
I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
Messenger:
in the army of any sort.
LEONATO:
What is he that you ask for, niece?
HERO:
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
Messenger:
O, he's returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.
BEATRICE:
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
BEATRICE:
Cupid at the flight, and my uncle's fool, reading
BEATRICE:
the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
BEATRICE:
him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
BEATRICE:
killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
BEATRICE:
he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
LEONATO:
Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much,
LEONATO:
but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
Messenger:
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
BEATRICE:
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it
BEATRICE:
he is a very valiant trencherman, he hath an
BEATRICE:
excellent stomach.
Messenger:
And a good soldier too, lady.
BEATRICE:
And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
Messenger:
A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all
Messenger:
honourable virtues.
BEATRICE:
It is so, indeed, he is no less than a stuffed man
BEATRICE:
but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
LEONATO:
You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
LEONATO:
kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her
LEONATO:
they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
LEONATO:
between them.
BEATRICE:
Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
BEATRICE:
conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
BEATRICE:
now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
BEATRICE:
he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
BEATRICE:
bear it for a difference between himself and his
BEATRICE:
horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
BEATRICE:
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
BEATRICE:
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
Messenger:
Is't possible?
BEATRICE:
Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
BEATRICE:
the fashion of his hat, it ever changes with the
BEATRICE:
next block.
Messenger:
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
BEATRICE:
No, an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
BEATRICE:
you, who is his companion? Is there no young
BEATRICE:
squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
Messenger:
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
BEATRICE:
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
BEATRICE:
is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
BEATRICE:
runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
BEATRICE:
he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
BEATRICE:
thousand pound ere a' be cured.
Messenger:
I will hold friends with you, lady.
BEATRICE:
Do, good friend.
LEONATO:
You will never run mad, niece.
BEATRICE:
No, not till a hot January.
Messenger:
Don Pedro is approached.
Messenger:
Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR
DON PEDRO:
Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
DON PEDRO:
trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
DON PEDRO:
cost, and you encounter it.
LEONATO:
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
LEONATO:
your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
LEONATO:
remain, but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
LEONATO:
and happiness takes his leave.
DON PEDRO:
You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
DON PEDRO:
is your daughter.
LEONATO:
Her mother hath many times told me so.
BENEDICK:
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
LEONATO:
Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a child.
DON PEDRO:
You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
DON PEDRO:
what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
DON PEDRO:
herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an
DON PEDRO:
honourable father.
BENEDICK:
If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
BENEDICK:
have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
BENEDICK:
like him as she is.
BEATRICE:
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
BEATRICE:
Benedick: nobody marks you.
BENEDICK:
What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
BEATRICE:
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
BEATRICE:
such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
BEATRICE:
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
BEATRICE:
in her presence.
BENEDICK:
Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
BENEDICK:
am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
BENEDICK:
would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
BENEDICK:
heart, for, truly, I love none.
BEATRICE:
A dear happiness to women: they would else have
BEATRICE:
been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
BEATRICE:
and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
BEATRICE:
had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
BEATRICE:
swear he loves me.
BENEDICK:
God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
BENEDICK:
gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
BENEDICK:
scratched face.
BEATRICE:
Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
BEATRICE:
a face as yours were.
BENEDICK:
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
BEATRICE:
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
BENEDICK:
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
BENEDICK:
so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
BENEDICK:
name, I have done.
BEATRICE:
You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
DON PEDRO:
That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
DON PEDRO:
and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
DON PEDRO:
invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
DON PEDRO:
the least a month, and he heartily prays some
DON PEDRO:
occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
DON PEDRO:
hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
LEONATO:
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
LEONATO:
To DON JOHN
LEONATO:
Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
LEONATO:
the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
DON JOHN:
I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
DON JOHN:
you.
LEONATO:
Please it your grace lead on?
DON PEDRO:
Your hand, Leonato, we will go together.
DON PEDRO:
Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO
CLAUDIO:
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
BENEDICK:
I noted her not, but I looked on her.
CLAUDIO:
Is she not a modest young lady?
BENEDICK:
Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
BENEDICK:
my simple true judgment, or would you have me speak
BENEDICK:
after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
CLAUDIO:
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
BENEDICK:
Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
BENEDICK:
praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
BENEDICK:
for a great praise: only this commendation I can
BENEDICK:
afford her, that were she other than she is, she
BENEDICK:
were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I
BENEDICK:
do not like her.
CLAUDIO:
Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
CLAUDIO:
truly how thou likest her.
BENEDICK:
Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
CLAUDIO:
Can the world buy such a jewel?
BENEDICK:
Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
BENEDICK:
with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
BENEDICK:
to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
BENEDICK:
rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
BENEDICK:
you, to go in the song?
CLAUDIO:
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
CLAUDIO:
looked on.
BENEDICK:
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
BENEDICK:
matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
BENEDICK:
possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
BENEDICK:
as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
BENEDICK:
hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
CLAUDIO:
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
CLAUDIO:
contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
BENEDICK:
Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
BENEDICK:
one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
BENEDICK:
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
BENEDICK:
Go to, i' faith, an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
BENEDICK:
into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
BENEDICK:
Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
BENEDICK:
Re-enter DON PEDRO
DON PEDRO:
What secret hath held you here, that you followed
DON PEDRO:
not to Leonato's?
BENEDICK:
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
DON PEDRO:
I charge thee on thy allegiance.
BENEDICK:
You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
BENEDICK:
man, I would have you think so, but, on my
BENEDICK:
allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
BENEDICK:
in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
BENEDICK:
Mark how short his answer is,--With Hero, Leonato's
BENEDICK:
short daughter.
CLAUDIO:
If this were so, so were it uttered.
BENEDICK:
Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
BENEDICK:
'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
BENEDICK:
so.'
CLAUDIO:
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
CLAUDIO:
should be otherwise.
DON PEDRO:
Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.
CLAUDIO:
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
DON PEDRO:
By my troth, I speak my thought.
CLAUDIO:
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
BENEDICK:
And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
CLAUDIO:
That I love her, I feel.
DON PEDRO:
That she is worthy, I know.
BENEDICK:
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
BENEDICK:
know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
BENEDICK:
fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
DON PEDRO:
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
DON PEDRO:
of beauty.
CLAUDIO:
And never could maintain his part but in the force
CLAUDIO:
of his will.
BENEDICK:
That a woman conceived me, I thank her, that she
BENEDICK:
brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
BENEDICK:
thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
BENEDICK:
forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
BENEDICK:
all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
BENEDICK:
them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
BENEDICK:
right to trust none, and the fine is, for the which
BENEDICK:
I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
DON PEDRO:
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
BENEDICK:
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
BENEDICK:
not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
BENEDICK:
with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
BENEDICK:
out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
BENEDICK:
up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
BENEDICK:
blind Cupid.
DON PEDRO:
Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
DON PEDRO:
wilt prove a notable argument.
BENEDICK:
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
BENEDICK:
at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
BENEDICK:
the shoulder, and called Adam.
DON PEDRO:
Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
DON PEDRO:
doth bear the yoke.'
BENEDICK:
The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible
BENEDICK:
Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
BENEDICK:
them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
BENEDICK:
and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
BENEDICK:
good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
BENEDICK:
'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
CLAUDIO:
If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
DON PEDRO:
Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
DON PEDRO:
Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
BENEDICK:
I look for an earthquake too, then.
DON PEDRO:
Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
DON PEDRO:
meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
DON PEDRO:
Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
DON PEDRO:
not fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made
DON PEDRO:
great preparation.
BENEDICK:
I have almost matter enough in me for such an
BENEDICK:
embassage, and so I commit you--
CLAUDIO:
To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--
DON PEDRO:
The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.
BENEDICK:
Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
BENEDICK:
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
BENEDICK:
the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
BENEDICK:
you flout old ends any further, examine your
BENEDICK:
conscience: and so I leave you.
BENEDICK:
Exit
CLAUDIO:
My liege, your highness now may do me good.
DON PEDRO:
My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
DON PEDRO:
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
DON PEDRO:
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
CLAUDIO:
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
DON PEDRO:
No child but Hero, she's his only heir.
DON PEDRO:
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
CLAUDIO:
O, my lord,
CLAUDIO:
When you went onward on this ended action,
CLAUDIO:
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
CLAUDIO:
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
CLAUDIO:
Than to drive liking to the name of love
CLAUDIO:
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
CLAUDIO:
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
CLAUDIO:
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
CLAUDIO:
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
CLAUDIO:
Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
DON PEDRO:
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
DON PEDRO:
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
DON PEDRO:
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
DON PEDRO:
And I will break with her and with her father,
DON PEDRO:
And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
DON PEDRO:
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
CLAUDIO:
How sweetly you do minister to love,
CLAUDIO:
That know love's grief by his complexion!
CLAUDIO:
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
CLAUDIO:
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
DON PEDRO:
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
DON PEDRO:
The fairest grant is the necessity.
DON PEDRO:
Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
DON PEDRO:
And I will fit thee with the remedy.
DON PEDRO:
I know we shall have revelling to-night
DON PEDRO:
I will assume thy part in some disguise
DON PEDRO:
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
DON PEDRO:
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
DON PEDRO:
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
DON PEDRO:
And strong encounter of my amorous tale
DON PEDRO:
Then after to her father will I break,
DON PEDRO:
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
DON PEDRO:
In practise let us put it presently.
DON PEDRO:
Exeunt
DON PEDRO:
SCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.
DON PEDRO:
Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting
LEONATO:
How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
LEONATO:
hath he provided this music?
ANTONIO:
He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
ANTONIO:
you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
LEONATO:
Are they good?
ANTONIO:
As the event stamps them: but they have a good
ANTONIO:
cover, they show well outward. The prince and Count
ANTONIO:
Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
ANTONIO:
orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine
ANTONIO:
the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
ANTONIO:
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
ANTONIO:
this night in a dance: and if he found her
ANTONIO:
accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
ANTONIO:
top and instantly break with you of it.
LEONATO:
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
ANTONIO:
A good sharp fellow: I will send for him, and
ANTONIO:
question him yourself.
LEONATO:
No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear
LEONATO:
itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
LEONATO:
that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
LEONATO:
if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
LEONATO:
Enter Attendants
LEONATO:
Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
LEONATO:
mercy, friend, go you with me, and I will use your
LEONATO:
skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
LEONATO:
Exeunt
LEONATO:
SCENE III. The same.
LEONATO:
Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE
CONRADE:
What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out
CONRADE:
of measure sad?
DON JOHN:
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds,
DON JOHN:
therefore the sadness is without limit.
CONRADE:
You should hear reason.
DON JOHN:
And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
CONRADE:
If not a present remedy, at least a patient
CONRADE:
sufferance.
DON JOHN:
I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,
DON JOHN:
born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
DON JOHN:
medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
DON JOHN:
what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
DON JOHN:
at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
DON JOHN:
for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
DON JOHN:
tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and
DON JOHN:
claw no man in his humour.
CONRADE:
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this
CONRADE:
till you may do it without controlment. You have of
CONRADE:
late stood out against your brother, and he hath
CONRADE:
ta'en you newly into his grace, where it is
CONRADE:
impossible you should take true root but by the
CONRADE:
fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
CONRADE:
that you frame the season for your own harvest.
DON JOHN:
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
DON JOHN:
his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
DON JOHN:
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
DON JOHN:
love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
DON JOHN:
be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
DON JOHN:
but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
DON JOHN:
a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog, therefore I
DON JOHN:
have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
DON JOHN:
mouth, I would bite, if I had my liberty, I would do
DON JOHN:
my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
DON JOHN:
seek not to alter me.
CONRADE:
Can you make no use of your discontent?
DON JOHN:
I make all use of it, for I use it only.
DON JOHN:
Who comes here?
DON JOHN:
Enter BORACHIO
DON JOHN:
What news, Borachio?
BORACHIO:
I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
BORACHIO:
brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
BORACHIO:
can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
DON JOHN:
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
DON JOHN:
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
DON JOHN:
unquietness?
BORACHIO:
Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
DON JOHN:
Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
BORACHIO:
Even he.
DON JOHN:
A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
DON JOHN:
he?
BORACHIO:
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
DON JOHN:
A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
BORACHIO:
Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
BORACHIO:
musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
BORACHIO:
in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
BORACHIO:
arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the
BORACHIO:
prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
BORACHIO:
obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
DON JOHN:
Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
DON JOHN:
my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
DON JOHN:
glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
DON JOHN:
bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?
CONRADE:
To the death, my lord.
DON JOHN:
Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
DON JOHN:
greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
DON JOHN:
my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?
BORACHIO:
We'll wait upon your lordship.
BORACHIO:
Exeunt
BORACHIO:
ACT II
BORACHIO:
SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.
BORACHIO:
Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others
LEONATO:
Was not Count John here at supper?
ANTONIO:
I saw him not.
BEATRICE:
How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
BEATRICE:
him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
HERO:
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
BEATRICE:
He were an excellent man that were made just in the
BEATRICE:
midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
BEATRICE:
like an image and says nothing, and the other too
BEATRICE:
like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
LEONATO:
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
LEONATO:
mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
LEONATO:
Benedick's face,--
BEATRICE:
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
BEATRICE:
enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
BEATRICE:
in the world, if a' could get her good-will.
LEONATO:
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
LEONATO:
husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
ANTONIO:
In faith, she's too curst.
BEATRICE:
Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
BEATRICE:
sending that way, for it is said, 'God sends a curst
BEATRICE:
cow short horns,' but to a cow too curst he sends none.
LEONATO:
So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
BEATRICE:
Just, if he send me no husband, for the which
BEATRICE:
blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
BEATRICE:
evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
BEATRICE:
beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
LEONATO:
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
BEATRICE:
What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
BEATRICE:
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
BEATRICE:
beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
BEATRICE:
beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
BEATRICE:
a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
BEATRICE:
man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
BEATRICE:
sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
BEATRICE:
apes into hell.
LEONATO:
Well, then, go you into hell?
BEATRICE:
No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet
BEATRICE:
me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
BEATRICE:
say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
BEATRICE:
heaven, here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
BEATRICE:
I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
BEATRICE:
heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
BEATRICE:
there live we as merry as the day is long.
ANTONIO:
[To HERO]  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
ANTONIO:
by your father.
BEATRICE:
Yes, faith, it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
BEATRICE:
and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
BEATRICE:
that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
BEATRICE:
make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
BEATRICE:
me.'
LEONATO:
Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
BEATRICE:
Not till God make men of some other metal than
BEATRICE:
earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
BEATRICE:
overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
BEATRICE:
an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
BEATRICE:
No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren,
BEATRICE:
and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
LEONATO:
Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
LEONATO:
do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
BEATRICE:
The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
BEATRICE:
not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
BEATRICE:
important, tell him there is measure in every thing
BEATRICE:
and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero
BEATRICE:
wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
BEATRICE:
a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
BEATRICE:
and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
BEATRICE:
fantastical, the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
BEATRICE:
measure, full of state and ancientry, and then comes
BEATRICE:
repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
BEATRICE:
cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
LEONATO:
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
BEATRICE:
I have a good eye, uncle, I can see a church by daylight.
LEONATO:
The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.
LEONATO:
All put on their masks
LEONATO:
Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked
DON PEDRO:
Lady, will you walk about with your friend?
HERO:
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
HERO:
I am yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away.
DON PEDRO:
With me in your company?
HERO:
I may say so, when I please.
DON PEDRO:
And when please you to say so?
HERO:
When I like your favour, for God defend the lute
HERO:
should be like the case!
DON PEDRO:
My visor is Philemon's roof, within the house is Jove.
HERO:
Why, then, your visor should be thatched.
DON PEDRO:
Speak low, if you speak love.
DON PEDRO:
Drawing her aside
BALTHASAR:
Well, I would you did like me.
MARGARET:
So would not I, for your own sake, for I have many
MARGARET:
ill-qualities.
BALTHASAR:
Which is one?
MARGARET:
I say my prayers aloud.
BALTHASAR:
I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.
MARGARET:
God match me with a good dancer!
BALTHASAR:
Amen.
MARGARET:
And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is
MARGARET:
done! Answer, clerk.
BALTHASAR:
No more words: the clerk is answered.
URSULA:
I know you well enough, you are Signior Antonio.
ANTONIO:
At a word, I am not.
URSULA:
I know you by the waggling of your head.
ANTONIO:
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
URSULA:
You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were
URSULA:
the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you
URSULA:
are he, you are he.
ANTONIO:
At a word, I am not.
URSULA:
Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your
URSULA:
excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,
URSULA:
mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an
URSULA:
end.
BEATRICE:
Will you not tell me who told you so?
BENEDICK:
No, you shall pardon me.
BEATRICE:
Nor will you not tell me who you are?
BENEDICK:
Not now.
BEATRICE:
That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
BEATRICE:
out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
BEATRICE:
Signior Benedick that said so.
BENEDICK:
What's he?
BEATRICE:
I am sure you know him well enough.
BENEDICK:
Not I, believe me.
BEATRICE:
Did he never make you laugh?
BENEDICK:
I pray you, what is he?
BEATRICE:
Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool,
BEATRICE:
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders
BEATRICE:
none but libertines delight in him, and the
BEATRICE:
commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany,
BEATRICE:
for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
BEATRICE:
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
BEATRICE:
the fleet: I would he had boarded me.
BENEDICK:
When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
BEATRICE:
Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me,
BEATRICE:
which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
BEATRICE:
strikes him into melancholy, and then there's a
BEATRICE:
partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
BEATRICE:
supper that night.
BEATRICE:
Music
BEATRICE:
We must follow the leaders.
BENEDICK:
In every good thing.
BEATRICE:
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at
BEATRICE:
the next turning.
BEATRICE:
Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO
DON JOHN:
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
DON JOHN:
withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
DON JOHN:
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.
BORACHIO:
And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.
DON JOHN:
Are not you Signior Benedick?
CLAUDIO:
You know me well, I am he.
DON JOHN:
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love
DON JOHN:
he is enamoured on Hero, I pray you, dissuade him
DON JOHN:
from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
DON JOHN:
do the part of an honest man in it.
CLAUDIO:
How know you he loves her?
DON JOHN:
I heard him swear his affection.
BORACHIO:
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her to-night.
DON JOHN:
Come, let us to the banquet.
DON JOHN:
Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO
CLAUDIO:
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
CLAUDIO:
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
CLAUDIO:
'Tis certain so, the prince wooes for himself.
CLAUDIO:
Friendship is constant in all other things
CLAUDIO:
Save in the office and affairs of love
CLAUDIO:
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues,
CLAUDIO:
Let every eye negotiate for itself
CLAUDIO:
And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch
CLAUDIO:
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
CLAUDIO:
This is an accident of hourly proof,
CLAUDIO:
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!
CLAUDIO:
Re-enter BENEDICK
BENEDICK:
Count Claudio?
CLAUDIO:
Yea, the same.
BENEDICK:
Come, will you go with me?
CLAUDIO:
Whither?
BENEDICK:
Even to the next willow, about your own business,
BENEDICK:
county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
BENEDICK:
about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
BENEDICK:
your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
BENEDICK:
it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.
CLAUDIO:
I wish him joy of her.
BENEDICK:
Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
BENEDICK:
sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
BENEDICK:
have served you thus?
CLAUDIO:
I pray you, leave me.
BENEDICK:
Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
BENEDICK:
boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
CLAUDIO:
If it will not be, I'll leave you.
CLAUDIO:
Exit
BENEDICK:
Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
BENEDICK:
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
BENEDICK:
know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
BENEDICK:
under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
BENEDICK:
am apt to do myself wrong, I am not so reputed: it
BENEDICK:
is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
BENEDICK:
that puts the world into her person and so gives me
BENEDICK:
out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
BENEDICK:
Re-enter DON PEDRO
DON PEDRO:
Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?
BENEDICK:
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
BENEDICK:
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
BENEDICK:
warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
BENEDICK:
that your grace had got the good will of this young
BENEDICK:
lady, and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
BENEDICK:
either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
BENEDICK:
to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
DON PEDRO:
To be whipped! What's his fault?
BENEDICK:
The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
BENEDICK:
overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
BENEDICK:
companion, and he steals it.
DON PEDRO:
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
DON PEDRO:
transgression is in the stealer.
BENEDICK:
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
BENEDICK:
and the garland too, for the garland he might have
BENEDICK:
worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
BENEDICK:
you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.
DON PEDRO:
I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
DON PEDRO:
the owner.
BENEDICK:
If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
BENEDICK:
you say honestly.
DON PEDRO:
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
DON PEDRO:
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
DON PEDRO:
wronged by you.
BENEDICK:
O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
BENEDICK:
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
BENEDICK:
answered her, my very visor began to assume life and
BENEDICK:
scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
BENEDICK:
myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
BENEDICK:
duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest
BENEDICK:
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
BENEDICK:
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
BENEDICK:
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs
BENEDICK:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
BENEDICK:
there were no living near her, she would infect to
BENEDICK:
the north star. I would not marry her, though she
BENEDICK:
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
BENEDICK:
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
BENEDICK:
turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
BENEDICK:
the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
BENEDICK:
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
BENEDICK:
some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while
BENEDICK:
she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
BENEDICK:
sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose, because they
BENEDICK:
would go thither, so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
BENEDICK:
and perturbation follows her.
DON PEDRO:
Look, here she comes.
DON PEDRO:
Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO
BENEDICK:
Will your grace command me any service to the
BENEDICK:
world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
BENEDICK:
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on,
BENEDICK:
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
BENEDICK:
furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
BENEDICK:
Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
BENEDICK:
Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
BENEDICK:
rather than hold three words' conference with this
BENEDICK:
harpy. You have no employment for me?
DON PEDRO:
None, but to desire your good company.
BENEDICK:
O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
BENEDICK:
endure my Lady Tongue.
BENEDICK:
Exit
DON PEDRO:
Come, lady, come, you have lost the heart of
DON PEDRO:
Signior Benedick.
BEATRICE:
Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I gave
BEATRICE:
him use for it, a double heart for his single one
BEATRICE:
marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
BEATRICE:
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.
DON PEDRO:
You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
BEATRICE:
So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
BEATRICE:
should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
BEATRICE:
Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
DON PEDRO:
Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?
CLAUDIO:
Not sad, my lord.
DON PEDRO:
How then? sick?
CLAUDIO:
Neither, my lord.
BEATRICE:
The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
BEATRICE:
well, but civil count, civil as an orange, and
BEATRICE:
something of that jealous complexion.
DON PEDRO:
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true,
DON PEDRO:
though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
DON PEDRO:
false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
DON PEDRO:
fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
DON PEDRO:
and his good will obtained: name the day of
DON PEDRO:
marriage, and God give thee joy!
LEONATO:
Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
LEONATO:
fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
LEONATO:
grace say Amen to it.
BEATRICE:
Speak, count, 'tis your cue.
CLAUDIO:
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
CLAUDIO:
but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
CLAUDIO:
you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
CLAUDIO:
you and dote upon the exchange.
BEATRICE:
Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
BEATRICE:
with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.
DON PEDRO:
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
BEATRICE:
Yea, my lord, I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
BEATRICE:
the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
BEATRICE:
ear that he is in her heart.
CLAUDIO:
And so she doth, cousin.
BEATRICE:
Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
BEATRICE:
world but I, and I am sunburnt, I may sit in a
BEATRICE:
corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!
DON PEDRO:
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
BEATRICE:
I would rather have one of your father's getting.
BEATRICE:
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
BEATRICE:
father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
DON PEDRO:
Will you have me, lady?
BEATRICE:
No, my lord, unless I might have another for
BEATRICE:
working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
BEATRICE:
every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
BEATRICE:
was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
DON PEDRO:
Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
DON PEDRO:
becomes you, for, out of question, you were born in
DON PEDRO:
a merry hour.
BEATRICE:
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then there
BEATRICE:
was a star danced, and under that was I born.
BEATRICE:
Cousins, God give you joy!
LEONATO:
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
BEATRICE:
I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.
BEATRICE:
Exit
DON PEDRO:
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
LEONATO:
There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
LEONATO:
lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
LEONATO:
not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say,
LEONATO:
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
LEONATO:
herself with laughing.
DON PEDRO:
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
LEONATO:
O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
DON PEDRO:
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
LEONATO:
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,
LEONATO:
they would talk themselves mad.
DON PEDRO:
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
CLAUDIO:
To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
CLAUDIO:
have all his rites.
LEONATO:
Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
LEONATO:
seven-night, and a time too brief, too, to have all
LEONATO:
things answer my mind.
DON PEDRO:
Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing
DON PEDRO:
but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
DON PEDRO:
dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
DON PEDRO:
Hercules' labours, which is, to bring Signior
DON PEDRO:
Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
DON PEDRO:
affection the one with the other. I would fain have
DON PEDRO:
it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
DON PEDRO:
you three will but minister such assistance as I
DON PEDRO:
shall give you direction.
LEONATO:
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten
LEONATO:
nights' watchings.
CLAUDIO:
And I, my lord.
DON PEDRO:
And you too, gentle Hero?
HERO:
I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my
HERO:
cousin to a good husband.
DON PEDRO:
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
DON PEDRO:
I know. Thus far can I praise him, he is of a noble
DON PEDRO:
strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
DON PEDRO:
will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
DON PEDRO:
shall fall in love with Benedick, and I, with your
DON PEDRO:
two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
DON PEDRO:
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
DON PEDRO:
shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
DON PEDRO:
Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall be
DON PEDRO:
ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
DON PEDRO:
and I will tell you my drift.
DON PEDRO:
Exeunt
DON PEDRO:
SCENE II. The same.
DON PEDRO:
Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO
DON JOHN:
It is so, the Count Claudio shall marry the
DON JOHN:
daughter of Leonato.
BORACHIO:
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.
DON JOHN:
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
DON JOHN:
medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
DON JOHN:
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
DON JOHN:
evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
BORACHIO:
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no
BORACHIO:
dishonesty shall appear in me.
DON JOHN:
Show me briefly how.
BORACHIO:
I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
BORACHIO:
I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
BORACHIO:
gentlewoman to Hero.
DON JOHN:
I remember.
BORACHIO:
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
BORACHIO:
appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.
DON JOHN:
What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
BORACHIO:
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
BORACHIO:
the prince your brother, spare not to tell him that
BORACHIO:
he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
BORACHIO:
Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
BORACHIO:
up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
DON JOHN:
What proof shall I make of that?
BORACHIO:
Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,
BORACHIO:
to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
BORACHIO:
other issue?
DON JOHN:
Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.
BORACHIO:
Go, then, find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
BORACHIO:
the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
BORACHIO:
that Hero loves me, intend a kind of zeal both to the
BORACHIO:
prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
BORACHIO:
honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
BORACHIO:
reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
BORACHIO:
semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
BORACHIO:
thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial
BORACHIO:
offer them instances, which shall bear no less
BORACHIO:
likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
BORACHIO:
hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
BORACHIO:
Claudio, and bring them to see this the very night
BORACHIO:
before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
BORACHIO:
will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
BORACHIO:
absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
BORACHIO:
of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
BORACHIO:
assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
DON JOHN:
Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
DON JOHN:
it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and
DON JOHN:
thy fee is a thousand ducats.
BORACHIO:
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning
BORACHIO:
shall not shame me.
DON JOHN:
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
DON JOHN:
Exeunt
DON JOHN:
SCENE III. LEONATO'S orchard.
DON JOHN:
Enter BENEDICK
BENEDICK:
Boy!
BENEDICK:
Enter Boy
Boy:
Signior?
BENEDICK:
In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither
BENEDICK:
to me in the orchard.
Boy:
I am here already, sir.
BENEDICK:
I know that, but I would have thee hence, and here again.
BENEDICK:
Exit Boy
BENEDICK:
I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
BENEDICK:
another man is a fool when he dedicates his
BENEDICK:
behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
BENEDICK:
such shallow follies in others, become the argument
BENEDICK:
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
BENEDICK:
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
BENEDICK:
with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he
BENEDICK:
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
BENEDICK:
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
BENEDICK:
good armour, and now will he lie ten nights awake,
BENEDICK:
carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
BENEDICK:
speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
BENEDICK:
and a soldier, and now is he turned orthography, his
BENEDICK:
words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
BENEDICK:
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
BENEDICK:
these eyes? I cannot tell, I think not: I will not
BENEDICK:
be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster, but
BENEDICK:
I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
BENEDICK:
of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
BENEDICK:
is fair, yet I am well, another is wise, yet I am
BENEDICK:
well, another virtuous, yet I am well, but till all
BENEDICK:
graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
BENEDICK:
my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain, wise,
BENEDICK:
or I'll none, virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her,
BENEDICK:
fair, or I'll   never look on her, mild, or come not
BENEDICK:
near me, noble, or not I for an angel, of good
BENEDICK:
discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
BENEDICK:
be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
BENEDICK:
Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.
BENEDICK:
Withdraws
BENEDICK:
Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO
DON PEDRO:
Come, shall we hear this music?
CLAUDIO:
Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
CLAUDIO:
As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!
DON PEDRO:
See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
CLAUDIO:
O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
CLAUDIO:
We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.
CLAUDIO:
Enter BALTHASAR with Music
DON PEDRO:
Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
BALTHASAR:
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
BALTHASAR:
To slander music any more than once.
DON PEDRO:
It is the witness still of excellency
DON PEDRO:
To put a strange face on his own perfection.
DON PEDRO:
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
BALTHASAR:
Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,
BALTHASAR:
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
BALTHASAR:
To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
BALTHASAR:
Yet will he swear he loves.
DON PEDRO:
Now, pray thee, come,
DON PEDRO:
Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
DON PEDRO:
Do it in notes.
BALTHASAR:
Note this before my notes,
BALTHASAR:
There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
DON PEDRO:
Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks,
DON PEDRO:
Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.
DON PEDRO:
Air
BENEDICK:
Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
BENEDICK:
not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
BENEDICK:
of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
BENEDICK:
all's done.
BENEDICK:
The Song
BALTHASAR:
Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
BALTHASAR:
Men were deceivers ever,
BALTHASAR:
One foot in sea and one on shore,
BALTHASAR:
To one thing constant never
BALTHASAR:
Then sigh not so, but let them go,
BALTHASAR:
And be you blithe and bonny,
BALTHASAR:
Converting all your sounds of woe
BALTHASAR:
Into Hey nonny, nonny.
BALTHASAR:
Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
BALTHASAR:
Of dumps so dull and heavy,
BALTHASAR:
The fraud of men was ever so,
BALTHASAR:
Since summer first was leafy
BALTHASAR:
Then sigh not so,  and c.
DON PEDRO:
By my troth, a good song.
BALTHASAR:
And an ill singer, my lord.
DON PEDRO:
Ha, no, no, faith, thou singest well enough for a shift.
BENEDICK:
An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,
BENEDICK:
they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad
BENEDICK:
voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the
BENEDICK:
night-raven, come what plague could have come after
BENEDICK:
it.
DON PEDRO:
Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,
DON PEDRO:
get us some excellent music, for to-morrow night we
DON PEDRO:
would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.
BALTHASAR:
The best I can, my lord.
DON PEDRO:
Do so: farewell.
DON PEDRO:
Exit BALTHASAR
DON PEDRO:
Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of
DON PEDRO:
to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
DON PEDRO:
Signior Benedick?
CLAUDIO:
O, ay: stalk on. stalk on, the fowl sits. I did
CLAUDIO:
never think that lady would have loved any man.
LEONATO:
No, nor I neither, but most wonderful that she
LEONATO:
should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
LEONATO:
all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
BENEDICK:
Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
LEONATO:
By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think
LEONATO:
of it but that she loves him with an enraged
LEONATO:
affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
DON PEDRO:
May be she doth but counterfeit.
CLAUDIO:
Faith, like enough.
LEONATO:
O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
LEONATO:
passion came so near the life of passion as she
LEONATO:
discovers it.
DON PEDRO:
Why, what effects of passion shows she?
CLAUDIO:
Bait the hook well, this fish will bite.
LEONATO:
What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
LEONATO:
my daughter tell you how.
CLAUDIO:
She did, indeed.
DON PEDRO:
How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
DON PEDRO:
thought her spirit had been invincible against all
DON PEDRO:
assaults of affection.
LEONATO:
I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially
LEONATO:
against Benedick.
BENEDICK:
I should think this a gull, but that the
BENEDICK:
white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
BENEDICK:
sure, hide himself in such reverence.
CLAUDIO:
He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.
DON PEDRO:
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
LEONATO:
No, and swears she never will: that's her torment.
CLAUDIO:
'Tis true, indeed, so your daughter says: 'Shall
CLAUDIO:
I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
CLAUDIO:
with scorn, write to him that I love him?'
LEONATO:
This says she now when she is beginning to write to
LEONATO:
him, for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
LEONATO:
there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
LEONATO:
sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
CLAUDIO:
Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
CLAUDIO:
pretty jest your daughter told us of.
LEONATO:
O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
LEONATO:
found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
CLAUDIO:
That.
LEONATO:
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,
LEONATO:
railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
LEONATO:
to write to one that she knew would flout her, 'I
LEONATO:
measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit, for I
LEONATO:
should flout him, if he writ to me, yea, though I
LEONATO:
love him, I should.'
CLAUDIO:
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
CLAUDIO:
beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses, 'O
CLAUDIO:
sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'
LEONATO:
She doth indeed, my daughter says so: and the
LEONATO:
ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
LEONATO:
is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
LEONATO:
to herself: it is very true.
DON PEDRO:
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
DON PEDRO:
other, if she will not discover it.
CLAUDIO:
To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
CLAUDIO:
torment the poor lady worse.
DON PEDRO:
An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
DON PEDRO:
excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion,
DON PEDRO:
she is virtuous.
CLAUDIO:
And she is exceeding wise.
DON PEDRO:
In every thing but in loving Benedick.
LEONATO:
O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
LEONATO:
a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
LEONATO:
the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
LEONATO:
cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
DON PEDRO:
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
DON PEDRO:
have daffed all other respects and made her half
DON PEDRO:
myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
DON PEDRO:
what a' will say.
LEONATO:
Were it good, think you?
CLAUDIO:
Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she
CLAUDIO:
will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
CLAUDIO:
she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
CLAUDIO:
her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
CLAUDIO:
accustomed crossness.
DON PEDRO:
She doth well: if she should make tender of her
DON PEDRO:
love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it, for the
DON PEDRO:
man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
CLAUDIO:
He is a very proper man.
DON PEDRO:
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
CLAUDIO:
Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.
DON PEDRO:
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
CLAUDIO:
And I take him to be valiant.
DON PEDRO:
As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
DON PEDRO:
quarrels you may say he is wise, for either he
DON PEDRO:
avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
DON PEDRO:
them with a most Christian-like fear.
LEONATO:
If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace
LEONATO:
if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
LEONATO:
quarrel with fear and trembling.
DON PEDRO:
And so will he do, for the man doth fear God,
DON PEDRO:
howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
DON PEDRO:
he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
DON PEDRO:
we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?
CLAUDIO:
Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
CLAUDIO:
good counsel.
LEONATO:
Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
DON PEDRO:
Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter
DON PEDRO:
let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I
DON PEDRO:
could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
DON PEDRO:
how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
LEONATO:
My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.
CLAUDIO:
If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
CLAUDIO:
trust my expectation.
DON PEDRO:
Let there be the same net spread for her, and that
DON PEDRO:
must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
DON PEDRO:
sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
DON PEDRO:
another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
DON PEDRO:
scene that I would see, which will be merely a
DON PEDRO:
dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
DON PEDRO:
Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO
BENEDICK:
[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the
BENEDICK:
conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
BENEDICK:
this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
BENEDICK:
seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
BENEDICK:
why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured
BENEDICK:
they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
BENEDICK:
the love come from her, they say too that she will
BENEDICK:
rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
BENEDICK:
never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
BENEDICK:
are they that hear their detractions and can put
BENEDICK:
them to mending. They say the lady is fair, 'tis a
BENEDICK:
truth, I can bear them witness, and virtuous, 'tis
BENEDICK:
so, I cannot reprove it, and wise, but for loving
BENEDICK:
me, by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
BENEDICK:
no great argument of her folly, for I will be
BENEDICK:
horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
BENEDICK:
odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
BENEDICK:
because I have railed so long against marriage: but
BENEDICK:
doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
BENEDICK:
in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
BENEDICK:
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
BENEDICK:
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
BENEDICK:
No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
BENEDICK:
die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
BENEDICK:
were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
BENEDICK:
she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
BENEDICK:
her.
BENEDICK:
Enter BEATRICE
BEATRICE:
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
BENEDICK:
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
BEATRICE:
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
BEATRICE:
pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
BEATRICE:
not have come.
BENEDICK:
You take pleasure then in the message?
BEATRICE:
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
BEATRICE:
point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
BEATRICE:
signior: fare you well.
BEATRICE:
Exit
BENEDICK:
Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
BENEDICK:
to dinner,' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
BENEDICK:
no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
BENEDICK:
to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
BENEDICK:
that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
BENEDICK:
not take pity of her, I am a villain, if I do not
BENEDICK:
love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.
BENEDICK:
Exit
BENEDICK:
ACT III
BENEDICK:
SCENE I. LEONATO'S garden.
BENEDICK:
Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA
HERO:
Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor,
HERO:
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
HERO:
Proposing with the prince and Claudio
HERO:
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
HERO:
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
HERO:
Is all of her, say that thou overheard'st us,
HERO:
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
HERO:
Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
HERO:
Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,
HERO:
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
HERO:
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
HERO:
To listen our purpose.  This is thy office,
HERO:
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
MARGARET:
I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
MARGARET:
Exit
HERO:
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
HERO:
As we do trace this alley up and down,
HERO:
Our talk must only be of Benedick.
HERO:
When I do name him, let it be thy part
HERO:
To praise him more than ever man did merit
HERO:
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
HERO:
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
HERO:
Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
HERO:
That only wounds by hearsay.
HERO:
Enter BEATRICE, behind
HERO:
Now begin,
HERO:
For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
HERO:
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
URSULA:
The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
URSULA:
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
URSULA:
And greedily devour the treacherous bait
URSULA:
So angle we for Beatrice, who even now
URSULA:
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
URSULA:
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
HERO:
Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
HERO:
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
HERO:
Approaching the bower
HERO:
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful,
HERO:
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
HERO:
As haggerds of the rock.
URSULA:
But are you sure
URSULA:
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
HERO:
So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
URSULA:
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
HERO:
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,
HERO:
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
HERO:
To wish him wrestle with affection,
HERO:
And never to let Beatrice know of it.
URSULA:
Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
URSULA:
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
URSULA:
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
HERO:
O god of love! I know he doth deserve
HERO:
As much as may be yielded to a man
HERO:
But Nature never framed a woman's heart
HERO:
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice,
HERO:
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
HERO:
Misprising what they look on, and her wit
HERO:
Values itself so highly that to her
HERO:
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
HERO:
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
HERO:
She is so self-endeared.
URSULA:
Sure, I think so,
URSULA:
And therefore certainly it were not good
URSULA:
She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
HERO:
Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
HERO:
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
HERO:
But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
HERO:
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister,
HERO:
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
HERO:
Made a foul blot, if tall, a lance ill-headed,
HERO:
If low, an agate very vilely cut,
HERO:
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds,
HERO:
If silent, why, a block moved with none.
HERO:
So turns she every man the wrong side out
HERO:
And never gives to truth and virtue that
HERO:
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
URSULA:
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
HERO:
No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
HERO:
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable
HERO:
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
HERO:
She would mock me into air, O, she would laugh me
HERO:
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
HERO:
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
HERO:
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly
HERO:
It were a better death than die with mocks,
HERO:
Which is as bad as die with tickling.
URSULA:
Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
HERO:
No, rather I will go to Benedick
HERO:
And counsel him to fight against his passion.
HERO:
And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
HERO:
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
HERO:
How much an ill word may empoison liking.
URSULA:
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
URSULA:
She cannot be so much without true judgment--
URSULA:
Having so swift and excellent a wit
URSULA:
As she is prized to have--as to refuse
URSULA:
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
HERO:
He is the only man of Italy.
HERO:
Always excepted my dear Claudio.
URSULA:
I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
URSULA:
Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
URSULA:
For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
URSULA:
Goes foremost in report through Italy.
HERO:
Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
URSULA:
His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
URSULA:
When are you married, madam?
HERO:
Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in
HERO:
I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
HERO:
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.
URSULA:
She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.
HERO:
If it proves so, then loving goes by haps
HERO:
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
HERO:
Exeunt HERO and URSULA
BEATRICE:
[Coming forward]
BEATRICE:
What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
BEATRICE:
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
BEATRICE:
Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
BEATRICE:
No glory lives behind the back of such.
BEATRICE:
And, Benedick, love on, I will requite thee,
BEATRICE:
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand
BEATRICE:
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
BEATRICE:
To bind our loves up in a holy band,
BEATRICE:
For others say thou dost deserve, and I
BEATRICE:
Believe it better than reportingly.
BEATRICE:
Exit
BEATRICE:
SCENE II. A room in LEONATO'S house
BEATRICE:
Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO
DON PEDRO:
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and
DON PEDRO:
then go I toward Arragon.
CLAUDIO:
I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll
CLAUDIO:
vouchsafe me.
DON PEDRO:
Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
DON PEDRO:
of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
DON PEDRO:
and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
DON PEDRO:
with Benedick for his company, for, from the crown
DON PEDRO:
of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
DON PEDRO:
mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
DON PEDRO:
bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
DON PEDRO:
him, he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
DON PEDRO:
tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
DON PEDRO:
tongue speaks.
BENEDICK:
Gallants, I am not as I have been.
LEONATO:
So say I	methinks you are sadder.
CLAUDIO:
I hope he be in love.
DON PEDRO:
Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
DON PEDRO:
him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
DON PEDRO:
he wants money.
BENEDICK:
I have the toothache.
DON PEDRO:
Draw it.
BENEDICK:
Hang it!
CLAUDIO:
You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
DON PEDRO:
What! sigh for the toothache?
LEONATO:
Where is but a humour or a worm.
BENEDICK:
Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
BENEDICK:
it.
CLAUDIO:
Yet say I, he is in love.
DON PEDRO:
There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
DON PEDRO:
a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as, to be
DON PEDRO:
a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
DON PEDRO:
shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
DON PEDRO:
the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
DON PEDRO:
the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
DON PEDRO:
to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
DON PEDRO:
fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
CLAUDIO:
If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
CLAUDIO:
believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
CLAUDIO:
mornings, what should that bode?
DON PEDRO:
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
CLAUDIO:
No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
CLAUDIO:
and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
CLAUDIO:
stuffed tennis-balls.
LEONATO:
Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
DON PEDRO:
Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
DON PEDRO:
out by that?
CLAUDIO:
That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
DON PEDRO:
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
CLAUDIO:
And when was he wont to wash his face?
DON PEDRO:
Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
DON PEDRO:
what they say of him.
CLAUDIO:
Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept into
CLAUDIO:
a lute-string and now governed by stops.
DON PEDRO:
Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
DON PEDRO:
conclude he is in love.
CLAUDIO:
Nay, but I know who loves him.
DON PEDRO:
That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
CLAUDIO:
Yes, and his ill conditions, and, in despite of
CLAUDIO:
all, dies for him.
DON PEDRO:
She shall be buried with her face upwards.
BENEDICK:
Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
BENEDICK:
signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
BENEDICK:
or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
BENEDICK:
hobby-horses must not hear.
BENEDICK:
Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO
DON PEDRO:
For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.
CLAUDIO:
'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
CLAUDIO:
played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two
CLAUDIO:
bears will not bite one another when they meet.
CLAUDIO:
Enter DON JOHN
DON JOHN:
My lord and brother, God save you!
DON PEDRO:
Good den, brother.
DON JOHN:
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
DON PEDRO:
In private?
DON JOHN:
If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear, for
DON JOHN:
what I would speak of concerns him.
DON PEDRO:
What's the matter?
DON JOHN:
[To CLAUDIO]  Means your lordship to be married
DON JOHN:
to-morrow?
DON PEDRO:
You know he does.
DON JOHN:
I know not that, when he knows what I know.
CLAUDIO:
If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
DON JOHN:
You may think I love you not: let that appear
DON JOHN:
hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
DON JOHN:
manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
DON JOHN:
well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
DON JOHN:
your ensuing marriage,--surely suit ill spent and
DON JOHN:
labour ill bestowed.
DON PEDRO:
Why, what's the matter?
DON JOHN:
I came hither to tell you, and, circumstances
DON JOHN:
shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,
DON JOHN:
the lady is disloyal.
CLAUDIO:
Who, Hero?
DON PEDRO:
Even she, Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero
CLAUDIO:
Disloyal?
DON JOHN:
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness, I
DON JOHN:
could say she were worse: think you of a worse
DON JOHN:
title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
DON JOHN:
further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
DON JOHN:
see her chamber-window entered, even the night
DON JOHN:
before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
DON JOHN:
to-morrow wed her, but it would better fit your honour
DON JOHN:
to change your mind.
CLAUDIO:
May this be so?
DON PEDRO:
I will not think it.
DON JOHN:
If you dare not trust that you see, confess not
DON JOHN:
that you know: if you will follow me, I will show
DON JOHN:
you enough, and when you have seen more and heard
DON JOHN:
more, proceed accordingly.
CLAUDIO:
If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
CLAUDIO:
her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
CLAUDIO:
wed, there will I shame her.
DON PEDRO:
And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join
DON PEDRO:
with thee to disgrace her.
DON JOHN:
I will disparage her no farther till you are my
DON JOHN:
witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and
DON JOHN:
let the issue show itself.
DON PEDRO:
O day untowardly turned!
CLAUDIO:
O mischief strangely thwarting!
DON JOHN:
O plague right well prevented! so will you say when
DON JOHN:
you have seen the sequel.
DON JOHN:
Exeunt
DON JOHN:
SCENE III. A street.
DON JOHN:
Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch
DOGBERRY:
Are you good men and true?
VERGES:
Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer
VERGES:
salvation, body and soul.
DOGBERRY:
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
DOGBERRY:
they should have any allegiance in them, being
DOGBERRY:
chosen for the prince's watch.
VERGES:
Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
DOGBERRY:
First, who think you the most desertless man to be
DOGBERRY:
constable?
First Watchman:
Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole, for they can
First Watchman:
write and read.
DOGBERRY:
Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
DOGBERRY:
you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
DOGBERRY:
the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.
Second Watchman:
Both which, master constable,--
DOGBERRY:
You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
DOGBERRY:
for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
DOGBERRY:
no boast of it, and for your writing and reading,
DOGBERRY:
let that appear when there is no need of such
DOGBERRY:
vanity. You are thought here to be the most
DOGBERRY:
senseless and fit man for the constable of the
DOGBERRY:
watch, therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
DOGBERRY:
charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men, you are
DOGBERRY:
to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
Second Watchman:
How if a' will not stand?
DOGBERRY:
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go, and
DOGBERRY:
presently call the rest of the watch together and
DOGBERRY:
thank God you are rid of a knave.
VERGES:
If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
VERGES:
of the prince's subjects.
DOGBERRY:
True, and they are to meddle with none but the
DOGBERRY:
prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
DOGBERRY:
the streets, for, for the watch to babble and to
DOGBERRY:
talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
Watchman:
We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
Watchman:
belongs to a watch.
DOGBERRY:
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
DOGBERRY:
watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should
DOGBERRY:
offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
DOGBERRY:
stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
DOGBERRY:
ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
Watchman:
How if they will not?
DOGBERRY:
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
DOGBERRY:
they make you not then the better answer, you may
DOGBERRY:
say they are not the men you took them for.
Watchman:
Well, sir.
DOGBERRY:
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
DOGBERRY:
of your office, to be no true man, and, for such
DOGBERRY:
kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
DOGBERRY:
why the more is for your honesty.
Watchman:
If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
Watchman:
hands on him?
DOGBERRY:
Truly, by your office, you may, but I think they
DOGBERRY:
that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
DOGBERRY:
way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
DOGBERRY:
show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
VERGES:
You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
DOGBERRY:
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
DOGBERRY:
a man who hath any honesty in him.
VERGES:
If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
VERGES:
to the nurse and bid her still it.
Watchman:
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
DOGBERRY:
Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
DOGBERRY:
her with crying, for the ewe that will not hear her
DOGBERRY:
lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.
VERGES:
'Tis very true.
DOGBERRY:
This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
DOGBERRY:
to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
DOGBERRY:
prince in the night, you may stay him.
VERGES:
Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.
DOGBERRY:
Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
DOGBERRY:
the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
DOGBERRY:
the prince be willing, for, indeed, the watch ought
DOGBERRY:
to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a
DOGBERRY:
man against his will.
VERGES:
By'r lady, I think it be so.
DOGBERRY:
Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
DOGBERRY:
any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
DOGBERRY:
fellows' counsels and your own, and good night.
DOGBERRY:
Come, neighbour.
Watchman:
Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
Watchman:
upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.
DOGBERRY:
One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
DOGBERRY:
about Signior Leonato's door, for the wedding being
DOGBERRY:
there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
DOGBERRY:
Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.
DOGBERRY:
Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES
DOGBERRY:
Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE
BORACHIO:
What Conrade!
Watchman:
[Aside]  Peace! stir not.
BORACHIO:
Conrade, I say!
CONRADE:
Here, man, I am at thy elbow.
BORACHIO:
Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there would a
BORACHIO:
scab follow.
CONRADE:
I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward
CONRADE:
with thy tale.
BORACHIO:
Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
BORACHIO:
it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard,
BORACHIO:
utter all to thee.
Watchman:
[Aside]  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.
BORACHIO:
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
CONRADE:
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
BORACHIO:
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
BORACHIO:
villany should be so rich, for when rich villains
BORACHIO:
have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
BORACHIO:
price they will.
CONRADE:
I wonder at it.
BORACHIO:
That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
BORACHIO:
the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
BORACHIO:
nothing to a man.
CONRADE:
Yes, it is apparel.
BORACHIO:
I mean, the fashion.
CONRADE:
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
BORACHIO:
Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
BORACHIO:
seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
BORACHIO:
is?
Watchman:
[Aside]  I know that Deformed, a' has been a vile
Watchman:
thief this seven year, a' goes up and down like a
Watchman:
gentleman: I remember his name.
BORACHIO:
Didst thou not hear somebody?
CONRADE:
No, 'twas the vane on the house.
BORACHIO:
Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
BORACHIO:
fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
BORACHIO:
bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
BORACHIO:
sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
BORACHIO:
in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
BORACHIO:
priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
BORACHIO:
shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
BORACHIO:
where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
CONRADE:
All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears
CONRADE:
out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
CONRADE:
thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
CONRADE:
shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
BORACHIO:
Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
BORACHIO:
wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
BORACHIO:
name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
BORACHIO:
chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
BORACHIO:
night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
BORACHIO:
tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
BORACHIO:
planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
BORACHIO:
John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
CONRADE:
And thought they Margaret was Hero?
BORACHIO:
Two of them did, the prince and Claudio, but the
BORACHIO:
devil my master knew she was Margaret, and partly
BORACHIO:
by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
BORACHIO:
the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
BORACHIO:
by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
BORACHIO:
Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged, swore
BORACHIO:
he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
BORACHIO:
at the temple, and there, before the whole
BORACHIO:
congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
BORACHIO:
and send her home again without a husband.
First Watchman:
We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!
Second Watchman:
Call up the right master constable. We have here
Second Watchman:
recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
Second Watchman:
ever was known in the commonwealth.
First Watchman:
And one Deformed is one of them: I know him, a'
First Watchman:
wears a lock.
CONRADE:
Masters, masters,--
Second Watchman:
You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.
CONRADE:
Masters,--
First Watchman:
Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.
BORACHIO:
We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken
BORACHIO:
up of these men's bills.
CONRADE:
A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.
CONRADE:
Exeunt
CONRADE:
SCENE IV. HERO's apartment.
CONRADE:
Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA
HERO:
Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire
HERO:
her to rise.
URSULA:
I will, lady.
HERO:
And bid her come hither.
URSULA:
Well.
URSULA:
Exit
MARGARET:
Troth, I think your other rabato were better.
HERO:
No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.
MARGARET:
By my troth, 's not so good, and I warrant your
MARGARET:
cousin will say so.
HERO:
My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear
HERO:
none but this.
MARGARET:
I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair
MARGARET:
were a thought browner, and your gown's a most rare
MARGARET:
fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's
MARGARET:
gown that they praise so.
HERO:
O, that exceeds, they say.
MARGARET:
By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of
MARGARET:
yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with
MARGARET:
silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,
MARGARET:
and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel
MARGARET:
but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent
MARGARET:
fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.
HERO:
God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is
HERO:
exceeding heavy.
MARGARET:
'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
HERO:
Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?
MARGARET:
Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not
MARGARET:
marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord
MARGARET:
honourable without marriage? I think you would have
MARGARET:
me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad
MARGARET:
thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend
MARGARET:
nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a
MARGARET:
husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband
MARGARET:
and the right wife, otherwise 'tis light, and not
MARGARET:
heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else, here she comes.
MARGARET:
Enter BEATRICE
HERO:
Good morrow, coz.
BEATRICE:
Good morrow, sweet Hero.
HERO:
Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?
BEATRICE:
I am out of all other tune, methinks.
MARGARET:
Clap's into 'Light o' love,' that goes without a
MARGARET:
burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.
BEATRICE:
Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
BEATRICE:
husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall
BEATRICE:
lack no barns.
MARGARET:
O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.
BEATRICE:
'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin, tis time you were
BEATRICE:
ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!
MARGARET:
For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
BEATRICE:
For the letter that begins them all, H.
MARGARET:
Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more
MARGARET:
sailing by the star.
BEATRICE:
What means the fool, trow?
MARGARET:
Nothing I, but God send every one their heart's desire!
HERO:
These gloves the count sent me, they are an
HERO:
excellent perfume.
BEATRICE:
I am stuffed, cousin, I cannot smell.
MARGARET:
A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.
BEATRICE:
O, God help me! God help me! how long have you
BEATRICE:
professed apprehension?
MARGARET:
Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?
BEATRICE:
It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your
BEATRICE:
cap. By my troth, I am sick.
MARGARET:
Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,
MARGARET:
and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.
HERO:
There thou prickest her with a thistle.
BEATRICE:
Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
BEATRICE:
this Benedictus.
MARGARET:
Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning, I
MARGARET:
meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
MARGARET:
that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am
MARGARET:
not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
MARGARET:
not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
MARGARET:
if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
MARGARET:
are in love or that you will be in love or that you
MARGARET:
can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
MARGARET:
now is he become a man: he swore he would never
MARGARET:
marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
MARGARET:
his meat without grudging: and how you may be
MARGARET:
converted I know not, but methinks you look with
MARGARET:
your eyes as other women do.
BEATRICE:
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
MARGARET:
Not a false gallop.
MARGARET:
Re-enter URSULA
URSULA:
Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior
URSULA:
Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the
URSULA:
town, are come to fetch you to church.
HERO:
Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.
HERO:
Exeunt
HERO:
SCENE V. Another room in LEONATO'S house.
HERO:
Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGES
LEONATO:
What would you with me, honest neighbour?
DOGBERRY:
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you
DOGBERRY:
that decerns you nearly.
LEONATO:
Brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time with me.
DOGBERRY:
Marry, this it is, sir.
VERGES:
Yes, in truth it is, sir.
LEONATO:
What is it, my good friends?
DOGBERRY:
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the
DOGBERRY:
matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so
DOGBERRY:
blunt as, God help, I would desire they were, but,
DOGBERRY:
in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
VERGES:
Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living
VERGES:
that is an old man and no honester than I.
DOGBERRY:
Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
LEONATO:
Neighbours, you are tedious.
DOGBERRY:
It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the
DOGBERRY:
poor duke's officers, but truly, for mine own part,
DOGBERRY:
if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in
DOGBERRY:
my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
LEONATO:
All thy tediousness on me, ah?
DOGBERRY:
Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis, for
DOGBERRY:
I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any
DOGBERRY:
man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I
DOGBERRY:
am glad to hear it.
VERGES:
And so am I.
LEONATO:
I would fain know what you have to say.
VERGES:
Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your
VERGES:
worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant
VERGES:
knaves as any in Messina.
DOGBERRY:
A good old man, sir, he will be talking: as they
DOGBERRY:
say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help
DOGBERRY:
us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,
DOGBERRY:
neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man, an two men
DOGBERRY:
ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
DOGBERRY:
soul, i' faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever
DOGBERRY:
broke bread, but God is to be worshipped, all men
DOGBERRY:
are not alike, alas, good neighbour!
LEONATO:
Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.
DOGBERRY:
Gifts that God gives.
LEONATO:
I must leave you.
DOGBERRY:
One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
DOGBERRY:
comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would
DOGBERRY:
have them this morning examined before your worship.
LEONATO:
Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I
LEONATO:
am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.
DOGBERRY:
It shall be suffigance.
LEONATO:
Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.
LEONATO:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to
Messenger:
her husband.
LEONATO:
I'll wait upon them: I am ready.
LEONATO:
Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger
DOGBERRY:
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole,
DOGBERRY:
bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we
DOGBERRY:
are now to examination these men.
VERGES:
And we must do it wisely.
DOGBERRY:
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you, here's
DOGBERRY:
that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only
DOGBERRY:
get the learned writer to set down our
DOGBERRY:
excommunication and meet me at the gaol.
DOGBERRY:
Exeunt
DOGBERRY:
ACT IV
DOGBERRY:
SCENE I. A church.
DOGBERRY:
Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and Attendants
LEONATO:
Come, Friar Francis, be brief, only to the plain
LEONATO:
form of marriage, and you shall recount their
LEONATO:
particular duties afterwards.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.
CLAUDIO:
No.
LEONATO:
To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.
HERO:
I do.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
If either of you know any inward impediment why you
FRIAR FRANCIS:
should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
to utter it.
CLAUDIO:
Know you any, Hero?
HERO:
None, my lord.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Know you any, count?
LEONATO:
I dare make his answer, none.
CLAUDIO:
O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
CLAUDIO:
do, not knowing what they do!
BENEDICK:
How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
BENEDICK:
laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
CLAUDIO:
Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave
CLAUDIO:
Will you with free and unconstrained soul
CLAUDIO:
Give me this maid, your daughter?
LEONATO:
As freely, son, as God did give her me.
CLAUDIO:
And what have I to give you back, whose worth
CLAUDIO:
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
DON PEDRO:
Nothing, unless you render her again.
CLAUDIO:
Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
CLAUDIO:
There, Leonato, take her back again
CLAUDIO:
Give not this rotten orange to your friend,
CLAUDIO:
She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
CLAUDIO:
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
CLAUDIO:
O, what authority and show of truth
CLAUDIO:
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
CLAUDIO:
Comes not that blood as modest evidence
CLAUDIO:
To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
CLAUDIO:
All you that see her, that she were a maid,
CLAUDIO:
By these exterior shows? But she is none
CLAUDIO:
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed,
CLAUDIO:
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
LEONATO:
What do you mean, my lord?
CLAUDIO:
Not to be married,
CLAUDIO:
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
LEONATO:
Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
LEONATO:
Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
LEONATO:
And made defeat of her virginity,--
CLAUDIO:
I know what you would say: if I have known her,
CLAUDIO:
You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
CLAUDIO:
And so extenuate the 'forehand sin
CLAUDIO:
No, Leonato,
CLAUDIO:
I never tempted her with word too large,
CLAUDIO:
But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
CLAUDIO:
Bashful sincerity and comely love.
HERO:
And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
CLAUDIO:
Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it
CLAUDIO:
You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
CLAUDIO:
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown,
CLAUDIO:
But you are more intemperate in your blood
CLAUDIO:
Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
CLAUDIO:
That rage in savage sensuality.
HERO:
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
LEONATO:
Sweet prince, why speak not you?
DON PEDRO:
What should I speak?
DON PEDRO:
I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
DON PEDRO:
To link my dear friend to a common stale.
LEONATO:
Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
DON JOHN:
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
BENEDICK:
This looks not like a nuptial.
HERO:
True! O God!
CLAUDIO:
Leonato, stand I here?
CLAUDIO:
Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
CLAUDIO:
Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?
LEONATO:
All this is so: but what of this, my lord?
CLAUDIO:
Let me but move one question to your daughter,
CLAUDIO:
And, by that fatherly and kindly power
CLAUDIO:
That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
LEONATO:
I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
HERO:
O, God defend me! how am I beset!
HERO:
What kind of catechising call you this?
CLAUDIO:
To make you answer truly to your name.
HERO:
Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
HERO:
With any just reproach?
CLAUDIO:
Marry, that can Hero,
CLAUDIO:
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
CLAUDIO:
What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
CLAUDIO:
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
CLAUDIO:
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
HERO:
I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.
DON PEDRO:
Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
DON PEDRO:
I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
DON PEDRO:
Myself, my brother and this grieved count
DON PEDRO:
Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
DON PEDRO:
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
DON PEDRO:
Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
DON PEDRO:
Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
DON PEDRO:
A thousand times in secret.
DON JOHN:
Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
DON JOHN:
Not to be spoke of,
DON JOHN:
There is not chastity enough in language
DON JOHN:
Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
DON JOHN:
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
CLAUDIO:
O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
CLAUDIO:
If half thy outward graces had been placed
CLAUDIO:
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
CLAUDIO:
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
CLAUDIO:
Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
CLAUDIO:
For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
CLAUDIO:
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
CLAUDIO:
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
CLAUDIO:
And never shall it more be gracious.
LEONATO:
Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
LEONATO:
HERO swoons
BEATRICE:
Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?
DON JOHN:
Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,
DON JOHN:
Smother her spirits up.
DON JOHN:
Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO
BENEDICK:
How doth the lady?
BEATRICE:
Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
BEATRICE:
Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!
LEONATO:
O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
LEONATO:
Death is the fairest cover for her shame
LEONATO:
That may be wish'd for.
BEATRICE:
How now, cousin Hero!
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Have comfort, lady.
LEONATO:
Dost thou look up?
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Yea, wherefore should she not?
LEONATO:
Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
LEONATO:
Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
LEONATO:
The story that is printed in her blood?
LEONATO:
Do not live, Hero, do not ope thine eyes
LEONATO:
For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
LEONATO:
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
LEONATO:
Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
LEONATO:
Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
LEONATO:
Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
LEONATO:
O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
LEONATO:
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
LEONATO:
Why had I not with charitable hand
LEONATO:
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
LEONATO:
Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
LEONATO:
I might have said 'No part of it is mine,
LEONATO:
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
LEONATO:
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
LEONATO:
And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
LEONATO:
That I myself was to myself not mine,
LEONATO:
Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
LEONATO:
Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
LEONATO:
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
LEONATO:
And salt too little which may season give
LEONATO:
To her foul-tainted flesh!
BENEDICK:
Sir, sir, be patient.
BENEDICK:
For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
BENEDICK:
I know not what to say.
BEATRICE:
O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
BENEDICK:
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
BEATRICE:
No, truly not, although, until last night,
BEATRICE:
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
LEONATO:
Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
LEONATO:
Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
LEONATO:
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
LEONATO:
Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
LEONATO:
Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Hear me a little,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
For I have only been silent so long
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And given way unto this course of fortune.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
...
FRIAR FRANCIS:
By noting of the lady I have mark'd
FRIAR FRANCIS:
A thousand blushing apparitions
FRIAR FRANCIS:
To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
FRIAR FRANCIS:
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
To burn the errors that these princes hold
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Trust not my reading nor my observations,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Which with experimental seal doth warrant
FRIAR FRANCIS:
The tenor of my book, trust not my age,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Under some biting error.
LEONATO:
Friar, it cannot be.
LEONATO:
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
LEONATO:
Is that she will not add to her damnation
LEONATO:
A sin of perjury, she not denies it
LEONATO:
Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
LEONATO:
That which appears in proper nakedness?
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
HERO:
They know that do accuse me, I know none
HERO:
If I know more of any man alive
HERO:
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
HERO:
Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
HERO:
Prove you that any man with me conversed
HERO:
At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
HERO:
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
HERO:
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
FRIAR FRANCIS:
There is some strange misprision in the princes.
BENEDICK:
Two of them have the very bent of honour,
BENEDICK:
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
BENEDICK:
The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
BENEDICK:
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.
LEONATO:
I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
LEONATO:
These hands shall tear her, if they wrong her honour,
LEONATO:
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
LEONATO:
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
LEONATO:
Nor age so eat up my invention,
LEONATO:
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
LEONATO:
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
LEONATO:
But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
LEONATO:
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
LEONATO:
Ability in means and choice of friends,
LEONATO:
To quit me of them throughly.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Pause awhile,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And let my counsel sway you in this case.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Your daughter here the princes left for dead
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And publish it that she is dead indeed,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Maintain a mourning ostentation
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And on your family's old monument
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
FRIAR FRANCIS:
That appertain unto a burial.
LEONATO:
What shall become of this? what will this do?
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Change slander to remorse, that is some good
FRIAR FRANCIS:
But not for that dream I on this strange course,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
But on this travail look for greater birth.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Upon the instant that she was accused,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Of every hearer: for it so falls out
FRIAR FRANCIS:
That what we have we prize not to the worth
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Why, then we rack the value, then we find
FRIAR FRANCIS:
The virtue that possession would not show us
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio
FRIAR FRANCIS:
When he shall hear she died upon his words,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Into his study of imagination,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And every lovely organ of her life
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
More moving-delicate and full of life,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Than when she lived indeed, then shall he mourn,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
If ever love had interest in his liver,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And wish he had not so accused her,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
No, though he thought his accusation true.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Let this be so, and doubt not but success
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Will fashion the event in better shape
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
The supposition of the lady's death
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Will quench the wonder of her infamy
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
As best befits her wounded reputation,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
In some reclusive and religious life,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.
BENEDICK:
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you
BENEDICK:
And though you know my inwardness and love
BENEDICK:
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
BENEDICK:
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
BENEDICK:
As secretly and justly as your soul
BENEDICK:
Should with your body.
LEONATO:
Being that I flow in grief,
LEONATO:
The smallest twine may lead me.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
'Tis well consented: presently away,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE
BENEDICK:
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
BEATRICE:
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
BENEDICK:
I will not desire that.
BEATRICE:
You have no reason, I do it freely.
BENEDICK:
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
BEATRICE:
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
BENEDICK:
Is there any way to show such friendship?
BEATRICE:
A very even way, but no such friend.
BENEDICK:
May a man do it?
BEATRICE:
It is a man's office, but not yours.
BENEDICK:
I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
BENEDICK:
not that strange?
BEATRICE:
As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
BEATRICE:
possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
BEATRICE:
you: but believe me not, and yet I lie not, I
BEATRICE:
confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.
BENEDICK:
By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
BEATRICE:
Do not swear, and eat it.
BENEDICK:
I will swear by it that you love me, and I will make
BENEDICK:
him eat it that says I love not you.
BEATRICE:
Will you not eat your word?
BENEDICK:
With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
BENEDICK:
I love thee.
BEATRICE:
Why, then, God forgive me!
BENEDICK:
What offence, sweet Beatrice?
BEATRICE:
You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
BEATRICE:
protest I loved you.
BENEDICK:
And do it with all thy heart.
BEATRICE:
I love you with so much of my heart that none is
BEATRICE:
left to protest.
BENEDICK:
Come, bid me do any thing for thee.
BEATRICE:
Kill Claudio.
BENEDICK:
Ha! not for the wide world.
BEATRICE:
You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
BENEDICK:
Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
BEATRICE:
I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
BEATRICE:
you: nay, I pray you, let me go.
BENEDICK:
Beatrice,--
BEATRICE:
In faith, I will go.
BENEDICK:
We'll be friends first.
BEATRICE:
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
BENEDICK:
Is Claudio thine enemy?
BEATRICE:
Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
BEATRICE:
hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
BEATRICE:
that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
BEATRICE:
come to take hands, and then, with public
BEATRICE:
accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
BEATRICE:
--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
BEATRICE:
in the market-place.
BENEDICK:
Hear me, Beatrice,--
BEATRICE:
Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!
BENEDICK:
Nay, but, Beatrice,--
BEATRICE:
Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
BENEDICK:
Beat--
BEATRICE:
Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
BEATRICE:
a goodly count, Count Comfect, a sweet gallant,
BEATRICE:
surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
BEATRICE:
had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
BEATRICE:
manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
BEATRICE:
compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
BEATRICE:
trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
BEATRICE:
that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
BEATRICE:
man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
BENEDICK:
Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
BEATRICE:
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
BENEDICK:
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
BEATRICE:
Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
BENEDICK:
Enough, I am engaged, I will challenge him. I will
BENEDICK:
kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
BENEDICK:
Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
BENEDICK:
hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
BENEDICK:
cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.
BENEDICK:
Exeunt
BENEDICK:
SCENE II. A prison.
BENEDICK:
Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and Sexton, in gowns, and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO
DOGBERRY:
Is our whole dissembly appeared?
VERGES:
O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.
Sexton:
Which be the malefactors?
DOGBERRY:
Marry, that am I and my partner.
VERGES:
Nay, that's certain, we have the exhibition to examine.
Sexton:
But which are the offenders that are to be
Sexton:
examined? let them come before master constable.
DOGBERRY:
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
DOGBERRY:
name, friend?
BORACHIO:
Borachio.
DOGBERRY:
Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
CONRADE:
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
DOGBERRY:
Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
DOGBERRY:
you serve God?
BORACHIO:
Yea, sir, we hope.
DOGBERRY:
Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
DOGBERRY:
write God first, for God defend but God should go
DOGBERRY:
before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
DOGBERRY:
that you are little better than false knaves, and it
DOGBERRY:
will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
DOGBERRY:
you for yourselves?
CONRADE:
Marry, sir, we say we are none.
DOGBERRY:
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
DOGBERRY:
will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah, a
DOGBERRY:
word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
DOGBERRY:
you are false knaves.
BORACHIO:
Sir, I say to you we are none.
DOGBERRY:
Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
DOGBERRY:
tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?
Sexton:
Master constable, you go not the way to examine
Sexton:
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
DOGBERRY:
Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
DOGBERRY:
come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
DOGBERRY:
name, accuse these men.
First Watchman:
This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's
First Watchman:
brother, was a villain.
DOGBERRY:
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
DOGBERRY:
perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.
BORACHIO:
Master constable,--
DOGBERRY:
Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
DOGBERRY:
I promise thee.
Sexton:
What heard you him say else?
Second Watchman:
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of
Second Watchman:
Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
DOGBERRY:
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
VERGES:
Yea, by mass, that it is.
Sexton:
What else, fellow?
First Watchman:
And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to
First Watchman:
disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.
DOGBERRY:
O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
DOGBERRY:
redemption for this.
Sexton:
What else?
Watchman:
This is all.
Sexton:
And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
Sexton:
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away,
Sexton:
Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
Sexton:
refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
Sexton:
Master constable, let these men be bound, and
Sexton:
brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show
Sexton:
him their examination.
Sexton:
Exit
DOGBERRY:
Come, let them be opinioned.
VERGES:
Let them be in the hands--
CONRADE:
Off, coxcomb!
DOGBERRY:
God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write
DOGBERRY:
down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
DOGBERRY:
Thou naughty varlet!
CONRADE:
Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.
DOGBERRY:
Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
DOGBERRY:
suspect my years? O that he were here to write me
DOGBERRY:
down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an
DOGBERRY:
ass, though it be not written down, yet forget not
DOGBERRY:
that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
DOGBERRY:
piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
DOGBERRY:
I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
DOGBERRY:
and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
DOGBERRY:
more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
DOGBERRY:
Messina, and one that knows the law, go to, and a
DOGBERRY:
rich fellow enough, go to, and a fellow that hath
DOGBERRY:
had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
DOGBERRY:
thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
DOGBERRY:
I had been writ down an ass!
DOGBERRY:
Exeunt
DOGBERRY:
ACT V
DOGBERRY:
SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.
DOGBERRY:
Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO
ANTONIO:
If you go on thus, you will kill yourself
ANTONIO:
And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
ANTONIO:
Against yourself.
LEONATO:
I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
LEONATO:
Which falls into mine ears as profitless
LEONATO:
As water in a sieve: give not me counsel,
LEONATO:
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
LEONATO:
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
LEONATO:
Bring me a father that so loved his child,
LEONATO:
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
LEONATO:
And bid him speak of patience,
LEONATO:
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
LEONATO:
And let it answer every strain for strain,
LEONATO:
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
LEONATO:
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form
LEONATO:
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
LEONATO:
Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
LEONATO:
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
LEONATO:
With candle-wasters, bring him yet to me,
LEONATO:
And I of him will gather patience.
LEONATO:
But there is no such man: for, brother, men
LEONATO:
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
LEONATO:
Which they themselves not feel, but, tasting it,
LEONATO:
Their counsel turns to passion, which before
LEONATO:
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
LEONATO:
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
LEONATO:
Charm ache with air and agony with words
LEONATO:
No, no, 'tis all men's office to speak patience
LEONATO:
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
LEONATO:
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
LEONATO:
To be so moral when he shall endure
LEONATO:
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel
LEONATO:
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
ANTONIO:
Therein do men from children nothing differ.
LEONATO:
I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood,
LEONATO:
For there was never yet philosopher
LEONATO:
That could endure the toothache patiently,
LEONATO:
However they have writ the style of gods
LEONATO:
And made a push at chance and sufferance.
ANTONIO:
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself,
ANTONIO:
Make those that do offend you suffer too.
LEONATO:
There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.
LEONATO:
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied,
LEONATO:
And that shall Claudio know, so shall the prince
LEONATO:
And all of them that thus dishonour her.
ANTONIO:
Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.
ANTONIO:
Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO
DON PEDRO:
Good den, good den.
CLAUDIO:
Good day to both of you.
LEONATO:
Hear you. my lords,--
DON PEDRO:
We have some haste, Leonato.
LEONATO:
Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord
LEONATO:
Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.
DON PEDRO:
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
ANTONIO:
If he could right himself with quarreling,
ANTONIO:
Some of us would lie low.
CLAUDIO:
Who wrongs him?
LEONATO:
Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou:--
LEONATO:
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword,
LEONATO:
I fear thee not.
CLAUDIO:
Marry, beshrew my hand,
CLAUDIO:
If it should give your age such cause of fear
CLAUDIO:
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
LEONATO:
Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me
LEONATO:
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
LEONATO:
As under privilege of age to brag
LEONATO:
What I have done being young, or what would do
LEONATO:
Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
LEONATO:
Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
LEONATO:
That I am forced to lay my reverence by
LEONATO:
And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
LEONATO:
Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
LEONATO:
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child,
LEONATO:
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
LEONATO:
And she lies buried with her ancestors,
LEONATO:
O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
LEONATO:
Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!
CLAUDIO:
My villany?
LEONATO:
Thine, Claudio, thine, I say.
DON PEDRO:
You say not right, old man.
LEONATO:
My lord, my lord,
LEONATO:
I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
LEONATO:
Despite his nice fence and his active practise,
LEONATO:
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.
CLAUDIO:
Away! I will not have to do with you.
LEONATO:
Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child
LEONATO:
If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
ANTONIO:
He shall kill two of us, and men indeed
ANTONIO:
But that's no matter, let him kill one first,
ANTONIO:
Win me and wear me, let him answer me.
ANTONIO:
Come, follow me, boy, come, sir boy, come, follow me
ANTONIO:
Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence,
ANTONIO:
Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
LEONATO:
Brother,--
ANTONIO:
Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece,
ANTONIO:
And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
ANTONIO:
That dare as well answer a man indeed
ANTONIO:
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue
ANTONIO:
Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!
LEONATO:
Brother Antony,--
ANTONIO:
Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
ANTONIO:
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--
ANTONIO:
Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
ANTONIO:
That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
ANTONIO:
Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
ANTONIO:
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
ANTONIO:
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst,
ANTONIO:
And this is all.
LEONATO:
But, brother Antony,--
ANTONIO:
Come, 'tis no matter
ANTONIO:
Do not you meddle, let me deal in this.
DON PEDRO:
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
DON PEDRO:
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death
DON PEDRO:
But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing
DON PEDRO:
But what was true and very full of proof.
LEONATO:
My lord, my lord,--
DON PEDRO:
I will not hear you.
LEONATO:
No? Come, brother, away! I will be heard.
ANTONIO:
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
ANTONIO:
Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO
DON PEDRO:
See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.
DON PEDRO:
Enter BENEDICK
CLAUDIO:
Now, signior, what news?
BENEDICK:
Good day, my lord.
DON PEDRO:
Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
DON PEDRO:
almost a fray.
CLAUDIO:
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
CLAUDIO:
with two old men without teeth.
DON PEDRO:
Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
DON PEDRO:
we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
BENEDICK:
In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
BENEDICK:
to seek you both.
CLAUDIO:
We have been up and down to seek thee, for we are
CLAUDIO:
high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
CLAUDIO:
away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
BENEDICK:
It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?
DON PEDRO:
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
CLAUDIO:
Never any did so, though very many have been beside
CLAUDIO:
their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
CLAUDIO:
minstrels, draw, to pleasure us.
DON PEDRO:
As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou
DON PEDRO:
sick, or angry?
CLAUDIO:
What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,
CLAUDIO:
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
BENEDICK:
Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you
BENEDICK:
charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.
CLAUDIO:
Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was
CLAUDIO:
broke cross.
DON PEDRO:
By this light, he changes more and more: I think
DON PEDRO:
he be angry indeed.
CLAUDIO:
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
BENEDICK:
Shall I speak a word in your ear?
CLAUDIO:
God bless me from a challenge!
BENEDICK:
[Aside to CLAUDIO]  You are a villain, I jest not
BENEDICK:
I will make it good how you dare, with what you
BENEDICK:
dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will
BENEDICK:
protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet
BENEDICK:
lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me
BENEDICK:
hear from you.
CLAUDIO:
Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
DON PEDRO:
What, a feast, a feast?
CLAUDIO:
I' faith, I thank him, he hath bid me to a calf's
CLAUDIO:
head and a capon, the which if I do not carve most
CLAUDIO:
curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find
CLAUDIO:
a woodcock too?
BENEDICK:
Sir, your wit ambles well, it goes easily.
DON PEDRO:
I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
DON PEDRO:
other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
DON PEDRO:
said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
DON PEDRO:
great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
DON PEDRO:
'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
DON PEDRO:
hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
DON PEDRO:
is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
DON PEDRO:
'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
DON PEDRO:
believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
DON PEDRO:
Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning,
DON PEDRO:
there's a double tongue, there's two tongues.' Thus
DON PEDRO:
did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
DON PEDRO:
virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
DON PEDRO:
wast the properest man in Italy.
CLAUDIO:
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
CLAUDIO:
not.
DON PEDRO:
Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
DON PEDRO:
did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly
DON PEDRO:
the old man's daughter told us all.
CLAUDIO:
All, all, and, moreover, God saw him when he was
CLAUDIO:
hid in the garden.
DON PEDRO:
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
DON PEDRO:
the sensible Benedick's head?
CLAUDIO:
Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the
CLAUDIO:
married man'?
BENEDICK:
Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave
BENEDICK:
you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
BENEDICK:
as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
BENEDICK:
hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
BENEDICK:
you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
BENEDICK:
the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
BENEDICK:
you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord
BENEDICK:
Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
BENEDICK:
then, peace be with him.
BENEDICK:
Exit
DON PEDRO:
He is in earnest.
CLAUDIO:
In most profound earnest, and, I'll warrant you, for
CLAUDIO:
the love of Beatrice.
DON PEDRO:
And hath challenged thee.
CLAUDIO:
Most sincerely.
DON PEDRO:
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
DON PEDRO:
doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!
CLAUDIO:
He is then a giant to an ape, but then is an ape a
CLAUDIO:
doctor to such a man.
DON PEDRO:
But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and
DON PEDRO:
be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?
DON PEDRO:
Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO
DOGBERRY:
Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she
DOGBERRY:
shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,
DOGBERRY:
an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.
DON PEDRO:
How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio
DON PEDRO:
one!
CLAUDIO:
Hearken after their offence, my lord.
DON PEDRO:
Officers, what offence have these men done?
DOGBERRY:
Marry, sir, they have committed false report,
DOGBERRY:
moreover, they have spoken untruths, secondarily,
DOGBERRY:
they are slanders, sixth and lastly, they have
DOGBERRY:
belied a lady, thirdly, they have verified unjust
DOGBERRY:
things, and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
DON PEDRO:
First, I ask thee what they have done, thirdly, I
DON PEDRO:
ask thee what's their offence, sixth and lastly, why
DON PEDRO:
they are committed, and, to conclude, what you lay
DON PEDRO:
to their charge.
CLAUDIO:
Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by
CLAUDIO:
my troth, there's one meaning well suited.
DON PEDRO:
Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus
DON PEDRO:
bound to your answer? this learned constable is
DON PEDRO:
too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?
BORACHIO:
Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer
BORACHIO:
do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
BORACHIO:
deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
BORACHIO:
could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
BORACHIO:
to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
BORACHIO:
to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
BORACHIO:
to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
BORACHIO:
the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
BORACHIO:
garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
BORACHIO:
marry her: my villany they have upon record, which
BORACHIO:
I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
BORACHIO:
to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
BORACHIO:
master's false accusation, and, briefly, I desire
BORACHIO:
nothing but the reward of a villain.
DON PEDRO:
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
CLAUDIO:
I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.
DON PEDRO:
But did my brother set thee on to this?
BORACHIO:
Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.
DON PEDRO:
He is composed and framed of treachery
DON PEDRO:
And fled he is upon this villany.
CLAUDIO:
Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
CLAUDIO:
In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
DOGBERRY:
Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our
DOGBERRY:
sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter
DOGBERRY:
and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time
DOGBERRY:
and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
VERGES:
Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the
VERGES:
Sexton too.
VERGES:
Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton
LEONATO:
Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,
LEONATO:
That, when I note another man like him,
LEONATO:
I may avoid him: which of these is he?
BORACHIO:
If you would know your wronger, look on me.
LEONATO:
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
LEONATO:
Mine innocent child?
BORACHIO:
Yea, even I alone.
LEONATO:
No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself
LEONATO:
Here stand a pair of honourable men,
LEONATO:
A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
LEONATO:
I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death
LEONATO:
Record it with your high and worthy deeds
LEONATO:
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
CLAUDIO:
I know not how to pray your patience,
CLAUDIO:
Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself,
CLAUDIO:
Impose me to what penance your invention
CLAUDIO:
Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
CLAUDIO:
But in mistaking.
DON PEDRO:
By my soul, nor I
DON PEDRO:
And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
DON PEDRO:
I would bend under any heavy weight
DON PEDRO:
That he'll enjoin me to.
LEONATO:
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live,
LEONATO:
That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
LEONATO:
Possess the people in Messina here
LEONATO:
How innocent she died, and if your love
LEONATO:
Can labour ought in sad invention,
LEONATO:
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
LEONATO:
And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night
LEONATO:
To-morrow morning come you to my house,
LEONATO:
And since you could not be my son-in-law,
LEONATO:
Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
LEONATO:
Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
LEONATO:
And she alone is heir to both of us
LEONATO:
Give her the right you should have given her cousin,
LEONATO:
And so dies my revenge.
CLAUDIO:
O noble sir,
CLAUDIO:
Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
CLAUDIO:
I do embrace your offer, and dispose
CLAUDIO:
For henceforth of poor Claudio.
LEONATO:
To-morrow then I will expect your coming,
LEONATO:
To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
LEONATO:
Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
LEONATO:
Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,
LEONATO:
Hired to it by your brother.
BORACHIO:
No, by my soul, she was not,
BORACHIO:
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
BORACHIO:
But always hath been just and virtuous
BORACHIO:
In any thing that I do know by her.
DOGBERRY:
Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
DOGBERRY:
black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
DOGBERRY:
me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his
DOGBERRY:
punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
DOGBERRY:
one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and
DOGBERRY:
a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's
DOGBERRY:
name, the which he hath used so long and never paid
DOGBERRY:
that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing
DOGBERRY:
for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.
LEONATO:
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
DOGBERRY:
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
DOGBERRY:
reverend youth, and I praise God for you.
LEONATO:
There's for thy pains.
DOGBERRY:
God save the foundation!
LEONATO:
Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
DOGBERRY:
I leave an arrant knave with your worship, which I
DOGBERRY:
beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the
DOGBERRY:
example of others. God keep your worship! I wish
DOGBERRY:
your worship well, God restore you to health! I
DOGBERRY:
humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry
DOGBERRY:
meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.
DOGBERRY:
Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES
LEONATO:
Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
ANTONIO:
Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.
DON PEDRO:
We will not fail.
CLAUDIO:
To-night I'll mourn with Hero.
LEONATO:
[To the Watch]  Bring you these fellows on. We'll
LEONATO:
talk with Margaret,
LEONATO:
How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
LEONATO:
Exeunt, severally
LEONATO:
SCENE II. LEONATO'S garden.
LEONATO:
Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting
BENEDICK:
Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at
BENEDICK:
my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
MARGARET:
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
BENEDICK:
In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
BENEDICK:
shall come over it, for, in most comely truth, thou
BENEDICK:
deservest it.
MARGARET:
To have no man come over me! why, shall I always
MARGARET:
keep below stairs?
BENEDICK:
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth, it catches.
MARGARET:
And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,
MARGARET:
but hurt not.
BENEDICK:
A most manly wit, Margaret, it will not hurt a
BENEDICK:
woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
BENEDICK:
thee the bucklers.
MARGARET:
Give us the swords, we have bucklers of our own.
BENEDICK:
If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
BENEDICK:
pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
MARGARET:
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
BENEDICK:
And therefore will come.
BENEDICK:
Exit MARGARET
BENEDICK:
Sings
BENEDICK:
The god of love,
BENEDICK:
That sits above,
BENEDICK:
And knows me, and knows me,
BENEDICK:
How pitiful I deserve,--
BENEDICK:
I mean in singing, but in loving, Leander the good
BENEDICK:
swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
BENEDICK:
a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
BENEDICK:
whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
BENEDICK:
blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
BENEDICK:
over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
BENEDICK:
cannot show it in rhyme, I have tried: I can find
BENEDICK:
out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
BENEDICK:
rhyme, for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme, for,
BENEDICK:
'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme, very ominous
BENEDICK:
endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
BENEDICK:
nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
BENEDICK:
Enter BEATRICE
BENEDICK:
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
BEATRICE:
Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.
BENEDICK:
O, stay but till then!
BEATRICE:
'Then' is spoken, fare you well now: and yet, ere
BEATRICE:
I go, let me go with that I came, which is, with
BEATRICE:
knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
BENEDICK:
Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss thee.
BEATRICE:
Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
BEATRICE:
foul breath, and foul breath is noisome, therefore I
BEATRICE:
will depart unkissed.
BENEDICK:
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
BENEDICK:
so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
BENEDICK:
plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either
BENEDICK:
I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
BENEDICK:
him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
BENEDICK:
which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
BEATRICE:
For them all together, which maintained so politic
BEATRICE:
a state of evil that they will not admit any good
BEATRICE:
part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
BEATRICE:
good parts did you first suffer love for me?
BENEDICK:
Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
BENEDICK:
indeed, for I love thee against my will.
BEATRICE:
In spite of your heart, I think, alas, poor heart!
BEATRICE:
If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
BEATRICE:
yours, for I will never love that which my friend hates.
BENEDICK:
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
BEATRICE:
It appears not in this confession: there's not one
BEATRICE:
wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
BENEDICK:
An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
BENEDICK:
the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
BENEDICK:
in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
BENEDICK:
no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
BENEDICK:
widow weeps.
BEATRICE:
And how long is that, think you?
BENEDICK:
Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
BENEDICK:
rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
BENEDICK:
wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
BENEDICK:
impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
BENEDICK:
own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
BENEDICK:
praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
BENEDICK:
praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?
BEATRICE:
Very ill.
BENEDICK:
And how do you?
BEATRICE:
Very ill too.
BENEDICK:
Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
BENEDICK:
you too, for here comes one in haste.
BENEDICK:
Enter URSULA
URSULA:
Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old
URSULA:
coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
URSULA:
falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
URSULA:
abused, and Don John is the author of all, who is
URSULA:
fed and gone. Will you come presently?
BEATRICE:
Will you go hear this news, signior?
BENEDICK:
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
BENEDICK:
buried in thy eyes, and moreover I will go with
BENEDICK:
thee to thy uncle's.
BENEDICK:
Exeunt
BENEDICK:
SCENE III. A church.
BENEDICK:
Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four with tapers
CLAUDIO:
Is this the monument of Leonato?
Lord:
It is, my lord.
CLAUDIO:
[Reading out of a scroll]
CLAUDIO:
Done to death by slanderous tongues
CLAUDIO:
Was the Hero that here lies
CLAUDIO:
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
CLAUDIO:
Gives her fame which never dies.
CLAUDIO:
So the life that died with shame
CLAUDIO:
Lives in death with glorious fame.
CLAUDIO:
Hang thou there upon the tomb,
CLAUDIO:
Praising her when I am dumb.
CLAUDIO:
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
CLAUDIO:
SONG.
CLAUDIO:
Pardon, goddess of the night,
CLAUDIO:
Those that slew thy virgin knight,
CLAUDIO:
For the which, with songs of woe,
CLAUDIO:
Round about her tomb they go.
CLAUDIO:
Midnight, assist our moan,
CLAUDIO:
Help us to sigh and groan,
CLAUDIO:
Heavily, heavily
CLAUDIO:
Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
CLAUDIO:
Till death be uttered,
CLAUDIO:
Heavily, heavily.
CLAUDIO:
Now, unto thy bones good night!
CLAUDIO:
Yearly will I do this rite.
DON PEDRO:
Good morrow, masters, put your torches out
DON PEDRO:
The wolves have prey'd, and look, the gentle day,
DON PEDRO:
Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
DON PEDRO:
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
DON PEDRO:
Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.
CLAUDIO:
Good morrow, masters: each his several way.
DON PEDRO:
Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds,
DON PEDRO:
And then to Leonato's we will go.
CLAUDIO:
And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
CLAUDIO:
Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.
CLAUDIO:
Exeunt
CLAUDIO:
SCENE IV. A room in LEONATO'S house.
CLAUDIO:
Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, BENEDICK, BEATRICE, MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Did I not tell you she was innocent?
LEONATO:
So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
LEONATO:
Upon the error that you heard debated
LEONATO:
But Margaret was in some fault for this,
LEONATO:
Although against her will, as it appears
LEONATO:
In the true course of all the question.
ANTONIO:
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
BENEDICK:
And so am I, being else by faith enforced
BENEDICK:
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
LEONATO:
Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,
LEONATO:
Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
LEONATO:
And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.
LEONATO:
Exeunt Ladies
LEONATO:
The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
LEONATO:
To visit me. You know your office, brother
LEONATO:
You must be father to your brother's daughter
LEONATO:
And give her to young Claudio.
ANTONIO:
Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
BENEDICK:
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
To do what, signior?
BENEDICK:
To bind me, or undo me, one of them.
BENEDICK:
Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
BENEDICK:
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
LEONATO:
That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
BENEDICK:
And I do with an eye of love requite her.
LEONATO:
The sight whereof I think you had from me,
LEONATO:
From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?
BENEDICK:
Your answer, sir, is enigmatical
BENEDICK:
But, for my will, my will is your good will
BENEDICK:
May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
BENEDICK:
In the state of honourable marriage
BENEDICK:
In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.
LEONATO:
My heart is with your liking.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And my help.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Here comes the prince and Claudio.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or three others
DON PEDRO:
Good morrow to this fair assembly.
LEONATO:
Good morrow, prince, good morrow, Claudio
LEONATO:
We here attend you. Are you yet determined
LEONATO:
To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?
CLAUDIO:
I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.
LEONATO:
Call her forth, brother, here's the friar ready.
LEONATO:
Exit ANTONIO
DON PEDRO:
Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
DON PEDRO:
That you have such a February face,
DON PEDRO:
So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?
CLAUDIO:
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
CLAUDIO:
Tush, fear not, man, we'll tip thy horns with gold
CLAUDIO:
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
CLAUDIO:
As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
CLAUDIO:
When he would play the noble beast in love.
BENEDICK:
Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,
BENEDICK:
And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
BENEDICK:
And got a calf in that same noble feat
BENEDICK:
Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.
CLAUDIO:
For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.
CLAUDIO:
Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked
CLAUDIO:
Which is the lady I must seize upon?
ANTONIO:
This same is she, and I do give you her.
CLAUDIO:
Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.
LEONATO:
No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
LEONATO:
Before this friar and swear to marry her.
CLAUDIO:
Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
CLAUDIO:
I am your husband, if you like of me.
HERO:
And when I lived, I was your other wife
HERO:
Unmasking
HERO:
And when you loved, you were my other husband.
CLAUDIO:
Another Hero!
HERO:
Nothing certainer
HERO:
One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
HERO:
And surely as I live, I am a maid.
DON PEDRO:
The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
LEONATO:
She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
FRIAR FRANCIS:
All this amazement can I qualify
FRIAR FRANCIS:
When after that the holy rites are ended,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death
FRIAR FRANCIS:
Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
FRIAR FRANCIS:
And to the chapel let us presently.
BENEDICK:
Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?
BEATRICE:
[Unmasking]  I answer to that name. What is your will?
BENEDICK:
Do not you love me?
BEATRICE:
Why, no, no more than reason.
BENEDICK:
Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
BENEDICK:
Have been deceived, they swore you did.
BEATRICE:
Do not you love me?
BENEDICK:
Troth, no, no more than reason.
BEATRICE:
Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
BEATRICE:
Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.
BENEDICK:
They swore that you were almost sick for me.
BEATRICE:
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
BENEDICK:
'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
BEATRICE:
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
LEONATO:
Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
CLAUDIO:
And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her,
CLAUDIO:
For here's a paper written in his hand,
CLAUDIO:
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
CLAUDIO:
Fashion'd to Beatrice.
HERO:
And here's another
HERO:
Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
HERO:
Containing her affection unto Benedick.
BENEDICK:
A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
BENEDICK:
Come, I will have thee, but, by this light, I take
BENEDICK:
thee for pity.
BEATRICE:
I would not deny you, but, by this good day, I yield
BEATRICE:
upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life,
BEATRICE:
for I was told you were in a consumption.
BENEDICK:
Peace! I will stop your mouth.
BENEDICK:
Kissing her
DON PEDRO:
How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
BENEDICK:
I'll tell thee what, prince, a college of
BENEDICK:
wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
BENEDICK:
thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No
BENEDICK:
if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
BENEDICK:
nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
BENEDICK:
purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
BENEDICK:
purpose that the world can say against it, and
BENEDICK:
therefore never flout at me for what I have said
BENEDICK:
against it, for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
BENEDICK:
conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
BENEDICK:
have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
BENEDICK:
kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.
CLAUDIO:
I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
CLAUDIO:
that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
CLAUDIO:
life, to make thee a double-dealer, which, out of
CLAUDIO:
question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
CLAUDIO:
exceedingly narrowly to thee.
BENEDICK:
Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
BENEDICK:
we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
BENEDICK:
and our wives' heels.
LEONATO:
We'll have dancing afterward.
BENEDICK:
First, of my word, therefore play, music. Prince,
BENEDICK:
thou art sad, get thee a wife, get thee a wife
BENEDICK:
there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.
BENEDICK:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
Messenger:
And brought with armed men back to Messina.
BENEDICK:
Think not on him till to-morrow
BENEDICK:
I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.
BENEDICK:
Strike up, pipers.
BENEDICK:
Dance
BENEDICK:
Exeunt
