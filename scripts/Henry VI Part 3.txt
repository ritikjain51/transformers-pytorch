WARWICK:
ACT I
WARWICK:
SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.
WARWICK:
Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers
WARWICK:
I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
YORK:
While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
YORK:
He slily stole away and left his men
YORK:
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
YORK:
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
YORK:
Cheer'd up the drooping army, and himself,
YORK:
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
YORK:
Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
YORK:
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
EDWARD:
Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
EDWARD:
Is either slain or wounded dangerously,
EDWARD:
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow
EDWARD:
That this is true, father, behold his blood.
MONTAGUE:
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
MONTAGUE:
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
RICHARD:
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
RICHARD:
Throwing down SOMERSET's head
YORK:
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
YORK:
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?
NORFOLK:
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
RICHARD:
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
WARWICK:
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
WARWICK:
Before I see thee seated in that throne
WARWICK:
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
WARWICK:
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
WARWICK:
This is the palace of the fearful king,
WARWICK:
And this the regal seat: possess it, York,
WARWICK:
For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
YORK:
Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will,
YORK:
For hither we have broken in by force.
NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you, he that flies shall die.
YORK:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords,
YORK:
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
YORK:
They go up
WARWICK:
And when the king comes, offer no violence,
WARWICK:
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
YORK:
The queen this day here holds her parliament,
YORK:
But little thinks we shall be of her council
YORK:
By words or blows here let us win our right.
RICHARD:
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
WARWICK:
The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
WARWICK:
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
WARWICK:
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
WARWICK:
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
YORK:
Then leave me not, my lords, be resolute,
YORK:
I mean to take possession of my right.
WARWICK:
Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
WARWICK:
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
WARWICK:
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
WARWICK:
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares
WARWICK:
Resolve thee, Richard, claim the English crown.
WARWICK:
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest
KING HENRY VI:
My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
KING HENRY VI:
Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
KING HENRY VI:
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
KING HENRY VI:
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
KING HENRY VI:
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
KING HENRY VI:
And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vow'd revenge
KING HENRY VI:
On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!
CLIFFORD:
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
WESTMORELAND:
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down
WESTMORELAND:
My heart for anger burns, I cannot brook it.
KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
CLIFFORD:
Patience is for poltroons, such as he
CLIFFORD:
He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
CLIFFORD:
My gracious lord, here in the parliament
CLIFFORD:
Let us assail the family of York.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.
KING HENRY VI:
Ah, know you not the city favours them,
KING HENRY VI:
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
EXETER:
But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.
KING HENRY VI:
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
KING HENRY VI:
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
KING HENRY VI:
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
KING HENRY VI:
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
KING HENRY VI:
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
KING HENRY VI:
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet,
KING HENRY VI:
I am thy sovereign.
YORK:
I am thine.
EXETER:
For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
YORK:
'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
EXETER:
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
WARWICK:
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
WARWICK:
In following this usurping Henry.
CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his natural king?
WARWICK:
True, Clifford, and that's Richard Duke of York.
KING HENRY VI:
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
YORK:
It must and shall be so: content thyself.
WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be king.
WESTMORELAND:
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster,
WESTMORELAND:
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
WARWICK:
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
WARWICK:
That we are those which chased you from the field
WARWICK:
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
WARWICK:
March'd through the city to the palace gates.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
WESTMORELAND:
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
WESTMORELAND:
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
WESTMORELAND:
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
CLIFFORD:
Urge it no more, lest that, instead of words,
CLIFFORD:
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
CLIFFORD:
As shall revenge his death before I stir.
WARWICK:
Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
YORK:
Will you we show our title to the crown?
YORK:
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
KING HENRY VI:
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
KING HENRY VI:
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York,
KING HENRY VI:
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March
KING HENRY VI:
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
KING HENRY VI:
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
KING HENRY VI:
And seized upon their towns and provinces.
WARWICK:
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
KING HENRY VI:
The lord protector lost it, and not I
KING HENRY VI:
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
RICHARD:
You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
RICHARD:
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
EDWARD:
Sweet father, do so, set it on your head.
MONTAGUE:
Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
MONTAGUE:
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
RICHARD:
Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
YORK:
Sons, peace!
KING HENRY VI:
Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
WARWICK:
Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords,
WARWICK:
And be you silent and attentive too,
WARWICK:
For he that interrupts him shall not live.
KING HENRY VI:
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
KING HENRY VI:
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
KING HENRY VI:
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm,
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
KING HENRY VI:
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
KING HENRY VI:
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
KING HENRY VI:
My title's good, and better far than his.
WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
KING HENRY VI:
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
YORK:
'Twas by rebellion against his king.
KING HENRY VI:
[Aside]  I know not what to say, my title's weak.--
KING HENRY VI:
Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?
YORK:
What then?
KING HENRY VI:
An if he may, then am I lawful king,
KING HENRY VI:
For Richard, in the view of many lords,
KING HENRY VI:
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
KING HENRY VI:
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
YORK:
He rose against him, being his sovereign,
YORK:
And made him to resign his crown perforce.
WARWICK:
Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
WARWICK:
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
EXETER:
No, for he could not so resign his crown
EXETER:
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
KING HENRY VI:
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
EXETER:
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
YORK:
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
EXETER:
My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
KING HENRY VI:
[Aside]  All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
WARWICK:
Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Can set the duke up in despite of me.
CLIFFORD:
King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
CLIFFORD:
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence
CLIFFORD:
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
CLIFFORD:
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
KING HENRY VI:
O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
YORK:
Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
YORK:
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?
WARWICK:
Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
WARWICK:
Or I will fill the house with armed men,
WARWICK:
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
WARWICK:
Write up his title with usurping blood.
WARWICK:
He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves
KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word
KING HENRY VI:
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
YORK:
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
YORK:
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.
KING HENRY VI:
I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
KING HENRY VI:
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
CLIFFORD:
What wrong is this unto the prince your son!
WARWICK:
What good is this to England and himself!
WESTMORELAND:
Base, fearful and despairing Henry!
CLIFFORD:
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
WESTMORELAND:
I cannot stay to hear these articles.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nor I.
CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
WESTMORELAND:
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
WESTMORELAND:
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
CLIFFORD:
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
CLIFFORD:
Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
CLIFFORD:
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND
WARWICK:
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
EXETER:
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Exeter!
WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?
KING HENRY VI:
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
KING HENRY VI:
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
KING HENRY VI:
But be it as it may: I here entail
KING HENRY VI:
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever,
KING HENRY VI:
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
KING HENRY VI:
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
KING HENRY VI:
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
KING HENRY VI:
And neither by treason nor hostility
KING HENRY VI:
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
YORK:
This oath I willingly take and will perform.
WARWICK:
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
KING HENRY VI:
And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
YORK:
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
EXETER:
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
EXETER:
Sennet. Here they come down
YORK:
Farewell, my gracious lord, I'll to my castle.
WARWICK:
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
NORFOLK:
And I to Norfolk with my followers.
MONTAGUE:
And I unto the sea from whence I came.
MONTAGUE:
Exeunt YORK, EDWARD, EDMUND, GEORGE, RICHARD,  WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, their Soldiers, and Attendants
KING HENRY VI:
And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
EXETER:
Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger
EXETER:
I'll steal away.
KING HENRY VI:
Exeter, so will I.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, go not from me, I will follow thee.
KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Who can be patient in such extremes?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
QUEEN MARGARET:
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
QUEEN MARGARET:
And disinherited thine only son.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Father, you cannot disinherit me
PRINCE EDWARD:
If you be king, why should not I succeed?
KING HENRY VI:
Pardon me, Margaret, pardon me, sweet son
KING HENRY VI:
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
QUEEN MARGARET:
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And given unto the house of York such head
QUEEN MARGARET:
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
QUEEN MARGARET:
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
QUEEN MARGARET:
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
QUEEN MARGARET:
And creep into it far before thy time?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The duke is made protector of the realm,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
QUEEN MARGARET:
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
QUEEN MARGARET:
Before I would have granted to that act.
QUEEN MARGARET:
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour
QUEEN MARGARET:
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
QUEEN MARGARET:
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
QUEEN MARGARET:
Whereby my son is disinherited.
QUEEN MARGARET:
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
QUEEN MARGARET:
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
QUEEN MARGARET:
And utter ruin of the house of York.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Our army is ready, come, we'll after them.
KING HENRY VI:
Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
KING HENRY VI:
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
PRINCE EDWARD:
When I return with victory from the field
PRINCE EDWARD:
I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, son, away, we may not linger thus.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
KING HENRY VI:
Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
KING HENRY VI:
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
KING HENRY VI:
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
KING HENRY VI:
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
KING HENRY VI:
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
KING HENRY VI:
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
KING HENRY VI:
The loss of those three lords torments my heart
KING HENRY VI:
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
KING HENRY VI:
Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.
EXETER:
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
EXETER:
Exeunt
EXETER:
SCENE II. Sandal Castle.
EXETER:
Enter RICHARD, EDWARD, and MONTAGUE
RICHARD:
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
EDWARD:
No, I can better play the orator.
MONTAGUE:
But I have reasons strong and forcible.
MONTAGUE:
Enter YORK
YORK:
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
YORK:
What is your quarrel? how began it first?
EDWARD:
No quarrel, but a slight contention.
YORK:
About what?
RICHARD:
About that which concerns your grace and us,
RICHARD:
The crown of England, father, which is yours.
YORK:
Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
RICHARD:
Your right depends not on his life or death.
EDWARD:
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now
EDWARD:
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
EDWARD:
It will outrun you, father, in the end.
YORK:
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
EDWARD:
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken
EDWARD:
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.
RICHARD:
No, God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
YORK:
I shall be, if I claim by open war.
RICHARD:
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
YORK:
Thou canst not, son, it is impossible.
RICHARD:
An oath is of no moment, being not took
RICHARD:
Before a true and lawful magistrate,
RICHARD:
That hath authority over him that swears
RICHARD:
Henry had none, but did usurp the place,
RICHARD:
Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
RICHARD:
Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
RICHARD:
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
RICHARD:
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,
RICHARD:
Within whose circuit is Elysium
RICHARD:
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
RICHARD:
Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
RICHARD:
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
RICHARD:
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
YORK:
Richard, enough, I will be king, or die.
YORK:
Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
YORK:
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
YORK:
Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
YORK:
And tell him privily of our intent.
YORK:
You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
YORK:
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise
YORK:
In them I trust, for they are soldiers,
YORK:
Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
YORK:
While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
YORK:
But that I seek occasion how to rise,
YORK:
And yet the king not privy to my drift,
YORK:
Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
YORK:
Enter a Messenger
YORK:
But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?
Messenger:
The queen with all the northern earls and lords
Messenger:
Intend here to besiege you in your castle
Messenger:
She is hard by with twenty thousand men,
Messenger:
And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.
YORK:
Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
YORK:
Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me,
YORK:
My brother Montague shall post to London
YORK:
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
YORK:
Whom we have left protectors of the king,
YORK:
With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
YORK:
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
MONTAGUE:
Brother, I go, I'll win them, fear it not
MONTAGUE:
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
MONTAGUE:
Exit
MONTAGUE:
Enter JOHN MORTIMER and HUGH MORTIMER
MONTAGUE:
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
MONTAGUE:
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour,
MONTAGUE:
The army of the queen mean to besiege us.
JOHN MORTIMER:
She shall not need, we'll meet her in the field.
YORK:
What, with five thousand men?
RICHARD:
Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need
RICHARD:
A woman's general, what should we fear?
RICHARD:
A march afar off
EDWARD:
I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
EDWARD:
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
YORK:
Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
YORK:
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
YORK:
Many a battle have I won in France,
YORK:
When as the enemy hath been ten to one
YORK:
Why should I not now have the like success?
YORK:
Alarum. Exeunt
YORK:
SCENE III. Field of battle betwixt Sandal Castle and Wakefield.
YORK:
Alarums. Enter RUTLAND and his Tutor
RUTLAND:
Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
RUTLAND:
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!
RUTLAND:
Enter CLIFFORD and Soldiers
CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
CLIFFORD:
As for the brat of this accursed duke,
CLIFFORD:
Whose father slew my father, he shall die.
Tutor:
And I, my lord, will bear him company.
CLIFFORD:
Soldiers, away with him!
Tutor:
Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
Tutor:
Lest thou be hated both of God and man!
Tutor:
Exit, dragged off by Soldiers
CLIFFORD:
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
CLIFFORD:
That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
RUTLAND:
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
RUTLAND:
That trembles under his devouring paws,
RUTLAND:
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
RUTLAND:
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
RUTLAND:
Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
RUTLAND:
And not with such a cruel threatening look.
RUTLAND:
Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
RUTLAND:
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath
RUTLAND:
Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.
CLIFFORD:
In vain thou speak'st, poor boy, my father's blood
CLIFFORD:
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.
RUTLAND:
Then let my father's blood open it again
RUTLAND:
He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.
CLIFFORD:
Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
CLIFFORD:
Were not revenge sufficient for me,
CLIFFORD:
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
CLIFFORD:
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
CLIFFORD:
It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
CLIFFORD:
The sight of any of the house of York
CLIFFORD:
Is as a fury to torment my soul,
CLIFFORD:
And till I root out their accursed line
CLIFFORD:
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
CLIFFORD:
Therefore--
CLIFFORD:
Lifting his hand
RUTLAND:
O, let me pray before I take my death!
RUTLAND:
To thee I pray, sweet Clifford, pity me!
CLIFFORD:
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
RUTLAND:
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
CLIFFORD:
Thy father hath.
RUTLAND:
But 'twas ere I was born.
RUTLAND:
Thou hast one son, for his sake pity me,
RUTLAND:
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
RUTLAND:
He be as miserably slain as I.
RUTLAND:
Ah, let me live in prison all my days,
RUTLAND:
And when I give occasion of offence,
RUTLAND:
Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
CLIFFORD:
No cause!
CLIFFORD:
Thy father slew my father, therefore, die.
CLIFFORD:
Stabs him
RUTLAND:
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
RUTLAND:
Dies
CLIFFORD:
Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!
CLIFFORD:
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
CLIFFORD:
Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
CLIFFORD:
Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.
CLIFFORD:
Exit
CLIFFORD:
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
CLIFFORD:
Alarum. Enter YORK
YORK:
The army of the queen hath got the field
YORK:
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me,
YORK:
And all my followers to the eager foe
YORK:
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
YORK:
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
YORK:
My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them
YORK:
But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
YORK:
Like men born to renown by life or death.
YORK:
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
YORK:
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
YORK:
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
YORK:
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
YORK:
In blood of those that had encounter'd him
YORK:
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
YORK:
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
YORK:
And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
YORK:
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
YORK:
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
YORK:
We bodged again, as I have seen a swan
YORK:
With bootless labour swim against the tide
YORK:
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
YORK:
A short alarum within
YORK:
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue,
YORK:
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury
YORK:
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury
YORK:
The sands are number'd that make up my life,
YORK:
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
YORK:
Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, PRINCE EDWARD, and Soldiers
YORK:
Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
YORK:
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage
YORK:
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
CLIFFORD:
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
CLIFFORD:
With downright payment, show'd unto my father.
CLIFFORD:
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
CLIFFORD:
And made an evening at the noontide prick.
YORK:
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
YORK:
A bird that will revenge upon you all
YORK:
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
YORK:
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
YORK:
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?
CLIFFORD:
So cowards fight when they can fly no further,
CLIFFORD:
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons,
CLIFFORD:
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
CLIFFORD:
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.
YORK:
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
YORK:
And in thy thought o'er-run my former time,
YORK:
And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,
YORK:
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
YORK:
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!
CLIFFORD:
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
CLIFFORD:
But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
QUEEN MARGARET:
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
NORTHUMBERLAND:
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart
NORTHUMBERLAND:
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
When he might spurn him with his foot away?
NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is war's prize to take all vantages,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
They lay hands on YORK, who struggles
CLIFFORD:
Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
So doth the cony struggle in the net.
YORK:
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty,
YORK:
So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
What would your grace have done unto him now?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What! was it you that would be England's king?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And made a preachment of your high descent?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
QUEEN MARGARET:
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
QUEEN MARGARET:
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
QUEEN MARGARET:
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
QUEEN MARGARET:
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Made issue from the bosom of the boy,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I should lament thy miserable state.
QUEEN MARGARET:
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
QUEEN MARGARET:
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport
QUEEN MARGARET:
York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
QUEEN MARGARET:
A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Putting a paper crown on his head
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And this is he was his adopted heir.
QUEEN MARGARET:
But how is it that great Plantagenet
QUEEN MARGARET:
Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
QUEEN MARGARET:
As I bethink me, you should not be king
QUEEN MARGARET:
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And rob his temples of the diadem,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Now in his life, against your holy oath?
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
CLIFFORD:
That is my office, for my father's sake.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, stay, lets hear the orisons he makes.
YORK:
She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
YORK:
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
YORK:
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
YORK:
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
YORK:
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
YORK:
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
YORK:
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
YORK:
I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
YORK:
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
YORK:
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
YORK:
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
YORK:
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
YORK:
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
YORK:
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
YORK:
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
YORK:
Unless the adage must be verified,
YORK:
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
YORK:
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,
YORK:
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small
YORK:
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired,
YORK:
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at
YORK:
'Tis government that makes them seem divine,
YORK:
The want thereof makes thee abominable
YORK:
Thou art as opposite to every good
YORK:
As the Antipodes are unto us,
YORK:
Or as the south to the septentrion.
YORK:
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
YORK:
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
YORK:
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
YORK:
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
YORK:
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible,
YORK:
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
YORK:
Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish
YORK:
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will
YORK:
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
YORK:
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
YORK:
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies
YORK:
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
YORK:
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
YORK:
Frenchwoman.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
NORTHUMBERLAND:
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
YORK:
That face of his the hungry cannibals
YORK:
Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood
YORK:
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
YORK:
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
YORK:
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears
YORK:
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
YORK:
And I with tears do wash the blood away.
YORK:
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this
YORK:
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
YORK:
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears,
YORK:
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
YORK:
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
YORK:
There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse,
YORK:
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
YORK:
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
YORK:
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world
YORK:
My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
I should not for my life but weep with him.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
CLIFFORD:
Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
CLIFFORD:
Stabbing him
QUEEN MARGARET:
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Stabbing him
YORK:
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
YORK:
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.
YORK:
Dies
QUEEN MARGARET:
Off with his head, and set it on York gates,
QUEEN MARGARET:
So York may overlook the town of York.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Flourish. Exeunt
QUEEN MARGARET:
ACT II
QUEEN MARGARET:
SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.
QUEEN MARGARET:
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
EDWARD:
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
EDWARD:
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
EDWARD:
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit
EDWARD:
Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news,
EDWARD:
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news,
EDWARD:
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
EDWARD:
The happy tidings of his good escape.
EDWARD:
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
RICHARD:
I cannot joy, until I be resolved
RICHARD:
Where our right valiant father is become.
RICHARD:
I saw him in the battle range about,
RICHARD:
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
RICHARD:
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
RICHARD:
As doth a lion in a herd of neat,
RICHARD:
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
RICHARD:
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
RICHARD:
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
RICHARD:
So fared our father with his enemies,
RICHARD:
So fled his enemies my warlike father
RICHARD:
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
RICHARD:
See how the morning opes her golden gates,
RICHARD:
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
RICHARD:
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
RICHARD:
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
EDWARD:
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
RICHARD:
Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,
RICHARD:
Not separated with the racking clouds,
RICHARD:
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
RICHARD:
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
RICHARD:
As if they vow'd some league inviolable
RICHARD:
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
RICHARD:
In this the heaven figures some event.
EDWARD:
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
EDWARD:
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
EDWARD:
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
EDWARD:
Each one already blazing by our meeds,
EDWARD:
Should notwithstanding join our lights together
EDWARD:
And over-shine the earth as this the world.
EDWARD:
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
EDWARD:
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
RICHARD:
Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
RICHARD:
You love the breeder better than the male.
RICHARD:
Enter a Messenger
RICHARD:
But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
RICHARD:
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
Messenger:
Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
Messenger:
When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
Messenger:
Your princely father and my loving lord!
EDWARD:
O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
RICHARD:
Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
Messenger:
Environed he was with many foes,
Messenger:
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
Messenger:
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
Messenger:
But Hercules himself must yield to odds,
Messenger:
And many strokes, though with a little axe,
Messenger:
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
Messenger:
By many hands your father was subdued,
Messenger:
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
Messenger:
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
Messenger:
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
Messenger:
Laugh'd in his face, and when with grief he wept,
Messenger:
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
Messenger:
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Messenger:
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain
Messenger:
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
Messenger:
They took his head, and on the gates of York
Messenger:
They set the same, and there it doth remain,
Messenger:
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
EDWARD:
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
EDWARD:
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
EDWARD:
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
EDWARD:
The flower of Europe for his chivalry,
EDWARD:
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
EDWARD:
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
EDWARD:
Now my soul's palace is become a prison
EDWARD:
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
EDWARD:
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
EDWARD:
For never henceforth shall I joy again,
EDWARD:
Never, O never shall I see more joy!
RICHARD:
I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
RICHARD:
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart
RICHARD:
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen,
RICHARD:
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
RICHARD:
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
RICHARD:
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
RICHARD:
To weep is to make less the depth of grief
RICHARD:
Tears then for babes, blows and revenge for me
RICHARD:
Richard, I bear thy name, I'll venge thy death,
RICHARD:
Or die renowned by attempting it.
EDWARD:
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee,
EDWARD:
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
RICHARD:
Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
RICHARD:
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun
RICHARD:
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say,
RICHARD:
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
RICHARD:
March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army
WARWICK:
How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
RICHARD:
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
RICHARD:
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
RICHARD:
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
RICHARD:
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
RICHARD:
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
EDWARD:
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
EDWARD:
Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,
EDWARD:
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
WARWICK:
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears,
WARWICK:
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
WARWICK:
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
WARWICK:
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
WARWICK:
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
WARWICK:
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
WARWICK:
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
WARWICK:
I, then in London keeper of the king,
WARWICK:
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
WARWICK:
And very well appointed, as I thought,
WARWICK:
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
WARWICK:
Bearing the king in my behalf along,
WARWICK:
For by my scouts I was advertised
WARWICK:
That she was coming with a full intent
WARWICK:
To dash our late decree in parliament
WARWICK:
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
WARWICK:
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
WARWICK:
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought
WARWICK:
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
WARWICK:
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
WARWICK:
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen,
WARWICK:
Or whether 'twas report of her success,
WARWICK:
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
WARWICK:
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
WARWICK:
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
WARWICK:
Their weapons like to lightning came and went,
WARWICK:
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
WARWICK:
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
WARWICK:
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
WARWICK:
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
WARWICK:
With promise of high pay and great rewards
WARWICK:
But all in vain, they had no heart to fight,
WARWICK:
And we in them no hope to win the day,
WARWICK:
So that we fled, the king unto the queen,
WARWICK:
Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
WARWICK:
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you
WARWICK:
For in the marches here we heard you were,
WARWICK:
Making another head to fight again.
EDWARD:
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
EDWARD:
And when came George from Burgundy to England?
WARWICK:
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers,
WARWICK:
And for your brother, he was lately sent
WARWICK:
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
WARWICK:
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
RICHARD:
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled
RICHARD:
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
RICHARD:
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
WARWICK:
Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear,
WARWICK:
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
WARWICK:
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
WARWICK:
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
WARWICK:
Were he as famous and as bold in war
WARWICK:
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.
RICHARD:
I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not
RICHARD:
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
RICHARD:
But in this troublous time what's to be done?
RICHARD:
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
RICHARD:
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
RICHARD:
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
RICHARD:
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
RICHARD:
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
RICHARD:
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,
WARWICK:
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
WARWICK:
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
WARWICK:
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
WARWICK:
And of their feather many more proud birds,
WARWICK:
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
WARWICK:
He swore consent to your succession,
WARWICK:
His oath enrolled in the parliament,
WARWICK:
And now to London all the crew are gone,
WARWICK:
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
WARWICK:
May make against the house of Lancaster.
WARWICK:
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong
WARWICK:
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
WARWICK:
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
WARWICK:
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
WARWICK:
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
WARWICK:
Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
WARWICK:
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
WARWICK:
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
WARWICK:
But never once again turn back and fly.
RICHARD:
Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak
RICHARD:
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
RICHARD:
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.
EDWARD:
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,
EDWARD:
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
EDWARD:
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!
WARWICK:
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York
WARWICK:
The next degree is England's royal throne,
WARWICK:
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
WARWICK:
In every borough as we pass along,
WARWICK:
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
WARWICK:
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
WARWICK:
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
WARWICK:
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
WARWICK:
But sound the trumpets, and about our task.
RICHARD:
Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
RICHARD:
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
RICHARD:
I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.
EDWARD:
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
EDWARD:
Enter a Messenger
WARWICK:
How now! what news?
Messenger:
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
Messenger:
The queen is coming with a puissant host,
Messenger:
And craves your company for speedy counsel.
WARWICK:
Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
WARWICK:
Exeunt
WARWICK:
SCENE II. Before York.
WARWICK:
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET,  PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets
QUEEN MARGARET:
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
QUEEN MARGARET:
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown
QUEEN MARGARET:
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck
KING HENRY VI:
To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
KING HENRY VI:
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
KING HENRY VI:
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
CLIFFORD:
My gracious liege, this too much lenity
CLIFFORD:
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
CLIFFORD:
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
CLIFFORD:
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
CLIFFORD:
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
CLIFFORD:
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
CLIFFORD:
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
CLIFFORD:
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
CLIFFORD:
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
CLIFFORD:
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
CLIFFORD:
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
CLIFFORD:
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
CLIFFORD:
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
CLIFFORD:
And raise his issue, like a loving sire,
CLIFFORD:
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
CLIFFORD:
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
CLIFFORD:
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
CLIFFORD:
Unreasonable creatures feed their young,
CLIFFORD:
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
CLIFFORD:
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
CLIFFORD:
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
CLIFFORD:
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
CLIFFORD:
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
CLIFFORD:
Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
CLIFFORD:
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
CLIFFORD:
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
CLIFFORD:
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
CLIFFORD:
And long hereafter say unto his child,
CLIFFORD:
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
CLIFFORD:
My careless father fondly gave away'?
CLIFFORD:
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy,
CLIFFORD:
And let his manly face, which promiseth
CLIFFORD:
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
CLIFFORD:
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
KING HENRY VI:
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
KING HENRY VI:
Inferring arguments of mighty force.
KING HENRY VI:
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
KING HENRY VI:
That things ill-got had ever bad success?
KING HENRY VI:
And happy always was it for that son
KING HENRY VI:
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
KING HENRY VI:
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,
KING HENRY VI:
And would my father had left me no more!
KING HENRY VI:
For all the rest is held at such a rate
KING HENRY VI:
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
KING HENRY VI:
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
KING HENRY VI:
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
KING HENRY VI:
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!
QUEEN MARGARET:
My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
QUEEN MARGARET:
You promised knighthood to our forward son
QUEEN MARGARET:
Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Edward, kneel down.
KING HENRY VI:
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight,
KING HENRY VI:
And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.
PRINCE:
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
PRINCE:
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
PRINCE:
And in that quarrel use it to the death.
CLIFFORD:
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
CLIFFORD:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Royal commanders, be in readiness
Messenger:
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Messenger:
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York,
Messenger:
And in the towns, as they do march along,
Messenger:
Proclaims him king, and many fly to him
Messenger:
Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
CLIFFORD:
I would your highness would depart the field
CLIFFORD:
The queen hath best success when you are absent.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
KING HENRY VI:
Why, that's my fortune too, therefore I'll stay.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it with resolution then to fight.
PRINCE EDWARD:
My royal father, cheer these noble lords
PRINCE EDWARD:
And hearten those that fight in your defence
PRINCE EDWARD:
Unsheathe your sword, good father, cry 'Saint George!'
PRINCE EDWARD:
March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and Soldiers
EDWARD:
Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
EDWARD:
And set thy diadem upon my head,
EDWARD:
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
QUEEN MARGARET:
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
EDWARD:
I am his king, and he should bow his knee,
EDWARD:
I was adopted heir by his consent
EDWARD:
Since when, his oath is broke, for, as I hear,
EDWARD:
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
EDWARD:
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
EDWARD:
To blot out me, and put his own son in.
CLIFFORD:
And reason too
CLIFFORD:
Who should succeed the father but the son?
RICHARD:
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
CLIFFORD:
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
CLIFFORD:
Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
RICHARD:
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
CLIFFORD:
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
RICHARD:
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
WARWICK:
What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
QUEEN MARGARET:
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Your legs did better service than your hands.
WARWICK:
Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
CLIFFORD:
You said so much before, and yet you fled.
WARWICK:
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
RICHARD:
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
RICHARD:
Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain
RICHARD:
The execution of my big-swoln heart
RICHARD:
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.
CLIFFORD:
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
RICHARD:
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
RICHARD:
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland,
RICHARD:
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
KING HENRY VI:
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
KING HENRY VI:
I prithee, give no limits to my tongue
KING HENRY VI:
I am a king, and privileged to speak.
CLIFFORD:
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
CLIFFORD:
Cannot be cured by words, therefore be still.
RICHARD:
Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword
RICHARD:
By him that made us all, I am resolved
RICHARD:
that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.
EDWARD:
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
EDWARD:
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
EDWARD:
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
WARWICK:
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head,
WARWICK:
For York in justice puts his armour on.
PRINCE EDWARD:
If that be right which Warwick says is right,
PRINCE EDWARD:
There is no wrong, but every thing is right.
RICHARD:
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands,
RICHARD:
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
QUEEN MARGARET:
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam,
QUEEN MARGARET:
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
QUEEN MARGARET:
As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
RICHARD:
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
RICHARD:
Whose father bears the title of a king,--
RICHARD:
As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
RICHARD:
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
RICHARD:
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
EDWARD:
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
EDWARD:
To make this shameless callet know herself.
EDWARD:
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
EDWARD:
Although thy husband may be Menelaus,
EDWARD:
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
EDWARD:
By that false woman, as this king by thee.
EDWARD:
His father revell'd in the heart of France,
EDWARD:
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop,
EDWARD:
And had he match'd according to his state,
EDWARD:
He might have kept that glory to this day,
EDWARD:
But when he took a beggar to his bed,
EDWARD:
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
EDWARD:
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
EDWARD:
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
EDWARD:
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
EDWARD:
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
EDWARD:
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept,
EDWARD:
And we, in pity of the gentle king,
EDWARD:
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
GEORGE:
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
GEORGE:
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
GEORGE:
We set the axe to thy usurping root,
GEORGE:
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
GEORGE:
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
GEORGE:
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
GEORGE:
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
EDWARD:
And, in this resolution, I defy thee,
EDWARD:
Not willing any longer conference,
EDWARD:
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
EDWARD:
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
EDWARD:
And either victory, or else a grave.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Stay, Edward.
EDWARD:
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay
EDWARD:
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
EDWARD:
Exeunt
EDWARD:
SCENE III. A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in
EDWARD:
Yorkshire.
EDWARD:
Alarum. Excursions. Enter WARWICK
WARWICK:
Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
WARWICK:
I lay me down a little while to breathe,
WARWICK:
For strokes received, and many blows repaid,
WARWICK:
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
WARWICK:
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
WARWICK:
Enter EDWARD, running
EDWARD:
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
EDWARD:
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.
WARWICK:
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?
WARWICK:
Enter GEORGE
GEORGE:
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair,
GEORGE:
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us
GEORGE:
What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?
EDWARD:
Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings,
EDWARD:
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.
EDWARD:
Enter RICHARD
RICHARD:
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
RICHARD:
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
RICHARD:
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance,
RICHARD:
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
RICHARD:
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
RICHARD:
'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
RICHARD:
So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
RICHARD:
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
RICHARD:
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
WARWICK:
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood
WARWICK:
I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.
WARWICK:
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
WARWICK:
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage,
WARWICK:
And look upon, as if the tragedy
WARWICK:
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
WARWICK:
Here on my knee I vow to God above,
WARWICK:
I'll never pause again, never stand still,
WARWICK:
Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
WARWICK:
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.
EDWARD:
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine,
EDWARD:
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
EDWARD:
And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
EDWARD:
I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
EDWARD:
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
EDWARD:
Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
EDWARD:
That to my foes this body must be prey,
EDWARD:
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,
EDWARD:
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
EDWARD:
Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
EDWARD:
Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.
RICHARD:
Brother, give me thy hand, and, gentle Warwick,
RICHARD:
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms
RICHARD:
I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
RICHARD:
That winter should cut off our spring-time so.
WARWICK:
Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.
GEORGE:
Yet let us all together to our troops,
GEORGE:
And give them leave to fly that will not stay,
GEORGE:
And call them pillars that will stand to us,
GEORGE:
And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
GEORGE:
As victors wear at the Olympian games
GEORGE:
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts,
GEORGE:
For yet is hope of life and victory.
GEORGE:
Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.
GEORGE:
Exeunt
GEORGE:
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
GEORGE:
Excursions. Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD
RICHARD:
Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone
RICHARD:
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
RICHARD:
And this for Rutland, both bound to revenge,
RICHARD:
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.
CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone
CLIFFORD:
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York,
CLIFFORD:
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland,
CLIFFORD:
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
CLIFFORD:
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
CLIFFORD:
To execute the like upon thyself,
CLIFFORD:
And so, have at thee!
CLIFFORD:
They fight. WARWICK comes, CLIFFORD flies
RICHARD:
Nay Warwick, single out some other chase,
RICHARD:
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
RICHARD:
Exeunt
RICHARD:
SCENE V. Another part of the field.
RICHARD:
Alarum. Enter KING HENRY VI alone
KING HENRY VI:
This battle fares like to the morning's war,
KING HENRY VI:
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
KING HENRY VI:
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
KING HENRY VI:
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
KING HENRY VI:
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
KING HENRY VI:
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind,
KING HENRY VI:
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
KING HENRY VI:
Forced to retire by fury of the wind
KING HENRY VI:
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind,
KING HENRY VI:
Now one the better, then another best,
KING HENRY VI:
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
KING HENRY VI:
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered
KING HENRY VI:
So is the equal of this fell war.
KING HENRY VI:
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
KING HENRY VI:
To whom God will, there be the victory!
KING HENRY VI:
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
KING HENRY VI:
Have chid me from the battle, swearing both
KING HENRY VI:
They prosper best of all when I am thence.
KING HENRY VI:
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so,
KING HENRY VI:
For what is in this world but grief and woe?
KING HENRY VI:
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
KING HENRY VI:
To be no better than a homely swain,
KING HENRY VI:
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
KING HENRY VI:
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
KING HENRY VI:
Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
KING HENRY VI:
How many make the hour full complete,
KING HENRY VI:
How many hours bring about the day,
KING HENRY VI:
How many days will finish up the year,
KING HENRY VI:
How many years a mortal man may live.
KING HENRY VI:
When this is known, then to divide the times
KING HENRY VI:
So many hours must I tend my flock,
KING HENRY VI:
So many hours must I take my rest,
KING HENRY VI:
So many hours must I contemplate,
KING HENRY VI:
So many hours must I sport myself,
KING HENRY VI:
So many days my ewes have been with young,
KING HENRY VI:
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean
KING HENRY VI:
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece
KING HENRY VI:
So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
KING HENRY VI:
Pass'd over to the end they were created,
KING HENRY VI:
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
KING HENRY VI:
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
KING HENRY VI:
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
KING HENRY VI:
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
KING HENRY VI:
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
KING HENRY VI:
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
KING HENRY VI:
O, yes, it doth, a thousand-fold it doth.
KING HENRY VI:
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
KING HENRY VI:
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
KING HENRY VI:
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
KING HENRY VI:
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
KING HENRY VI:
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
KING HENRY VI:
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
KING HENRY VI:
His body couched in a curious bed,
KING HENRY VI:
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.
KING HENRY VI:
Alarum. Enter a Son that has killed his father, dragging in the dead body
Son:
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
Son:
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
Son:
May be possessed with some store of crowns,
Son:
And I, that haply take them from him now,
Son:
May yet ere night yield both my life and them
Son:
To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
Son:
Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
Son:
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
Son:
O heavy times, begetting such events!
Son:
From London by the king was I press'd forth,
Son:
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
Son:
Came on the part of York, press'd by his master,
Son:
And I, who at his hands received my life, him
Son:
Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
Son:
Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
Son:
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
Son:
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks,
Son:
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
KING HENRY VI:
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
KING HENRY VI:
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
KING HENRY VI:
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
KING HENRY VI:
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear,
KING HENRY VI:
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
KING HENRY VI:
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter a Father that has killed his son, bringing in the body
Father:
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
Father:
Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold
Father:
For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
Father:
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
Father:
Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
Father:
Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
Father:
Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,
Father:
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
Father:
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
Father:
O, pity, God, this miserable age!
Father:
What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
Father:
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
Father:
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
Father:
O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
Father:
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!
KING HENRY VI:
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
KING HENRY VI:
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
KING HENRY VI:
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
KING HENRY VI:
The red rose and the white are on his face,
KING HENRY VI:
The fatal colours of our striving houses
KING HENRY VI:
The one his purple blood right well resembles,
KING HENRY VI:
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth
KING HENRY VI:
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish,
KING HENRY VI:
If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.
Son:
How will my mother for a father's death
Son:
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
Father:
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
Father:
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
KING HENRY VI:
How will the country for these woful chances
KING HENRY VI:
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
Son:
Was ever son so rued a father's death?
Father:
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
KING HENRY VI:
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
KING HENRY VI:
Much is your sorrow, mine ten times so much.
Son:
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
Son:
Exit with the body
Father:
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet,
Father:
My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
Father:
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go,
Father:
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell,
Father:
And so obsequious will thy father be,
Father:
Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
Father:
As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
Father:
I'll bear thee hence, and let them fight that will,
Father:
For I have murdered where I should not kill.
Father:
Exit with the body
KING HENRY VI:
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
KING HENRY VI:
Here sits a king more woful than you are.
KING HENRY VI:
Alarums: excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, and EXETER
PRINCE EDWARD:
Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
PRINCE EDWARD:
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull
PRINCE EDWARD:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my lord, towards Berwick post amain
QUEEN MARGARET:
Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
QUEEN MARGARET:
Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
QUEEN MARGARET:
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Are at our backs, and therefore hence amain.
EXETER:
Away! for vengeance comes along with them
EXETER:
Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed,
EXETER:
Or else come after: I'll away before.
KING HENRY VI:
Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter
KING HENRY VI:
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
KING HENRY VI:
Whither the queen intends. Forward, away!
KING HENRY VI:
Exeunt
KING HENRY VI:
SCENE VI. Another part of the field.
KING HENRY VI:
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
CLIFFORD:
Here burns my candle out, ay, here it dies,
CLIFFORD:
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
CLIFFORD:
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
CLIFFORD:
More than my body's parting with my soul!
CLIFFORD:
My love and fear glued many friends to thee,
CLIFFORD:
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
CLIFFORD:
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
CLIFFORD:
The common people swarm like summer flies,
CLIFFORD:
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
CLIFFORD:
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
CLIFFORD:
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
CLIFFORD:
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
CLIFFORD:
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
CLIFFORD:
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
CLIFFORD:
Or as thy father and his father did,
CLIFFORD:
Giving no ground unto the house of York,
CLIFFORD:
They never then had sprung like summer flies,
CLIFFORD:
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
CLIFFORD:
Had left no mourning widows for our death,
CLIFFORD:
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
CLIFFORD:
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
CLIFFORD:
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
CLIFFORD:
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds,
CLIFFORD:
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight
CLIFFORD:
The foe is merciless, and will not pity,
CLIFFORD:
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
CLIFFORD:
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
CLIFFORD:
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
CLIFFORD:
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest,
CLIFFORD:
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.
CLIFFORD:
He faints
CLIFFORD:
Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers
EDWARD:
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
EDWARD:
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
EDWARD:
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
EDWARD:
That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
EDWARD:
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
EDWARD:
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
EDWARD:
But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?
WARWICK:
No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
WARWICK:
For, though before his face I speak the words
WARWICK:
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave
WARWICK:
And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.
WARWICK:
CLIFFORD groans, and dies
EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
RICHARD:
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
EDWARD:
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
EDWARD:
If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
RICHARD:
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford,
RICHARD:
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
RICHARD:
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
RICHARD:
But set his murdering knife unto the root
RICHARD:
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
RICHARD:
I mean our princely father, Duke of York.
WARWICK:
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
WARWICK:
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there,
WARWICK:
Instead whereof let this supply the room
WARWICK:
Measure for measure must be answered.
EDWARD:
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
EDWARD:
That nothing sung but death to us and ours
EDWARD:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
EDWARD:
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
WARWICK:
I think his understanding is bereft.
WARWICK:
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
WARWICK:
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
WARWICK:
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
RICHARD:
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth
RICHARD:
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
RICHARD:
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
RICHARD:
Which in the time of death he gave our father.
GEORGE:
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
RICHARD:
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
EDWARD:
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
WARWICK:
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
GEORGE:
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
RICHARD:
Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
EDWARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.
GEORGE:
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
WARWICK:
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.
RICHARD:
What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
RICHARD:
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
RICHARD:
I know by that he's dead, and, by my soul,
RICHARD:
If this right hand would buy two hour's life,
RICHARD:
That I in all despite might rail at him,
RICHARD:
This hand should chop it off, and with the
RICHARD:
issuing blood
RICHARD:
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
RICHARD:
York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
WARWICK:
Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
WARWICK:
And rear it in the place your father's stands.
WARWICK:
And now to London with triumphant march,
WARWICK:
There to be crowned England's royal king
WARWICK:
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
WARWICK:
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen
WARWICK:
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together,
WARWICK:
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
WARWICK:
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again,
WARWICK:
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
WARWICK:
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
WARWICK:
First will I see the coronation,
WARWICK:
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
WARWICK:
To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.
EDWARD:
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be,
EDWARD:
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
EDWARD:
And never will I undertake the thing
EDWARD:
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
EDWARD:
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
EDWARD:
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
EDWARD:
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
RICHARD:
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester,
RICHARD:
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.
WARWICK:
Tut, that's a foolish observation
WARWICK:
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,
WARWICK:
To see these honours in possession.
WARWICK:
Exeunt
WARWICK:
ACT III
WARWICK:
SCENE I. A forest in the north of England.
WARWICK:
Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands
First Keeper:
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,
First Keeper:
For through this laund anon the deer will come,
First Keeper:
And in this covert will we make our stand,
First Keeper:
Culling the principal of all the deer.
Second Keeper:
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
First Keeper:
That cannot be, the noise of thy cross-bow
First Keeper:
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
First Keeper:
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best
First Keeper:
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
First Keeper:
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
First Keeper:
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
Second Keeper:
Here comes a man, let's stay till he be past.
Second Keeper:
Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook
KING HENRY VI:
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
KING HENRY VI:
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
KING HENRY VI:
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine,
KING HENRY VI:
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
KING HENRY VI:
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed
KING HENRY VI:
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
KING HENRY VI:
No humble suitors press to speak for right,
KING HENRY VI:
No, not a man comes for redress of thee,
KING HENRY VI:
For how can I help them, and not myself?
First Keeper:
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee
First Keeper:
This is the quondam king, let's seize upon him.
KING HENRY VI:
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
KING HENRY VI:
For wise men say it is the wisest course.
Second Keeper:
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
First Keeper:
Forbear awhile, we'll hear a little more.
KING HENRY VI:
My queen and son are gone to France for aid,
KING HENRY VI:
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
KING HENRY VI:
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
KING HENRY VI:
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
KING HENRY VI:
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost,
KING HENRY VI:
For Warwick is a subtle orator,
KING HENRY VI:
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
KING HENRY VI:
By this account then Margaret may win him,
KING HENRY VI:
For she's a woman to be pitied much
KING HENRY VI:
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast,
KING HENRY VI:
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart,
KING HENRY VI:
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn,
KING HENRY VI:
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
KING HENRY VI:
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give,
KING HENRY VI:
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
KING HENRY VI:
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
KING HENRY VI:
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed,
KING HENRY VI:
He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd,
KING HENRY VI:
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more,
KING HENRY VI:
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
KING HENRY VI:
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
KING HENRY VI:
And in conclusion wins the king from her,
KING HENRY VI:
With promise of his sister, and what else,
KING HENRY VI:
To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
KING HENRY VI:
O Margaret, thus 'twill be, and thou, poor soul,
KING HENRY VI:
Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!
Second Keeper:
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
KING HENRY VI:
More than I seem, and less than I was born to
KING HENRY VI:
A man at least, for less I should not be,
KING HENRY VI:
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
Second Keeper:
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
KING HENRY VI:
Why, so I am, in mind, and that's enough.
Second Keeper:
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
KING HENRY VI:
My crown is in my heart, not on my head,
KING HENRY VI:
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
KING HENRY VI:
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content
KING HENRY VI:
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
Second Keeper:
Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Second Keeper:
Your crown content and you must be contented
Second Keeper:
To go along with us, for as we think,
Second Keeper:
You are the king King Edward hath deposed,
Second Keeper:
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Second Keeper:
Will apprehend you as his enemy.
KING HENRY VI:
But did you never swear, and break an oath?
Second Keeper:
No, never such an oath, nor will not now.
KING HENRY VI:
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
Second Keeper:
Here in this country, where we now remain.
KING HENRY VI:
I was anointed king at nine months old,
KING HENRY VI:
My father and my grandfather were kings,
KING HENRY VI:
And you were sworn true subjects unto me
KING HENRY VI:
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
First Keeper:
No,
First Keeper:
For we were subjects but while you were king.
KING HENRY VI:
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
KING HENRY VI:
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
KING HENRY VI:
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
KING HENRY VI:
And as the air blows it to me again,
KING HENRY VI:
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
KING HENRY VI:
And yielding to another when it blows,
KING HENRY VI:
Commanded always by the greater gust,
KING HENRY VI:
Such is the lightness of you common men.
KING HENRY VI:
But do not break your oaths, for of that sin
KING HENRY VI:
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
KING HENRY VI:
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded,
KING HENRY VI:
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
First Keeper:
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
KING HENRY VI:
So would you be again to Henry,
KING HENRY VI:
If he were seated as King Edward is.
First Keeper:
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
First Keeper:
To go with us unto the officers.
KING HENRY VI:
In God's name, lead, your king's name be obey'd
KING HENRY VI:
And what God will, that let your king perform,
KING HENRY VI:
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
KING HENRY VI:
Exeunt
KING HENRY VI:
SCENE II. London. The palace.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY
KING EDWARD IV:
Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
KING EDWARD IV:
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
KING EDWARD IV:
His lands then seized on by the conqueror
KING EDWARD IV:
Her suit is now to repossess those lands,
KING EDWARD IV:
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
KING EDWARD IV:
Because in quarrel of the house of York
KING EDWARD IV:
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
GLOUCESTER:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit,
GLOUCESTER:
It were dishonour to deny it her.
KING EDWARD IV:
It were no less, but yet I'll make a pause.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea, is it so?
GLOUCESTER:
I see the lady hath a thing to grant,
GLOUCESTER:
Before the king will grant her humble suit.
CLARENCE:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true
CLARENCE:
he keeps the wind!
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence!
KING EDWARD IV:
Widow, we will consider of your suit,
KING EDWARD IV:
And come some other time to know our mind.
LADY GREY:
Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay
LADY GREY:
May it please your highness to resolve me now,
LADY GREY:
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, widow? then I'll warrant
GLOUCESTER:
you all your lands,
GLOUCESTER:
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
GLOUCESTER:
Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
CLARENCE:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not, unless she
CLARENCE:
chance to fall.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll
GLOUCESTER:
take vantages.
KING EDWARD IV:
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
CLARENCE:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a
CLARENCE:
child of her.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay, whip me then: he'll rather
GLOUCESTER:
give her two.
LADY GREY:
Three, my most gracious lord.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four, if you'll
GLOUCESTER:
be ruled by him.
KING EDWARD IV:
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
LADY GREY:
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
KING EDWARD IV:
Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, good leave have you, for
GLOUCESTER:
you will have leave,
GLOUCESTER:
Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.
GLOUCESTER:
GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire
KING EDWARD IV:
Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
LADY GREY:
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
KING EDWARD IV:
And would you not do much to do them good?
LADY GREY:
To do them good, I would sustain some harm.
KING EDWARD IV:
Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
LADY GREY:
Therefore I came unto your majesty.
KING EDWARD IV:
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
LADY GREY:
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
KING EDWARD IV:
What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?
LADY GREY:
What you command, that rests in me to do.
KING EDWARD IV:
But you will take exceptions to my boon.
LADY GREY:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
LADY GREY:
Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard, and much rain
GLOUCESTER:
wears the marble.
CLARENCE:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay, then
CLARENCE:
her wax must melt.
LADY GREY:
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
KING EDWARD IV:
An easy task, 'tis but to love a king.
LADY GREY:
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
LADY GREY:
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made, she seals it
GLOUCESTER:
with a curtsy.
KING EDWARD IV:
But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
LADY GREY:
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
KING EDWARD IV:
What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
LADY GREY:
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers,
LADY GREY:
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
KING EDWARD IV:
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
LADY GREY:
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
KING EDWARD IV:
But now you partly may perceive my mind.
LADY GREY:
My mind will never grant what I perceive
LADY GREY:
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
KING EDWARD IV:
To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
LADY GREY:
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
LADY GREY:
Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower,
LADY GREY:
For by that loss I will not purchase them.
KING EDWARD IV:
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
LADY GREY:
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
LADY GREY:
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
LADY GREY:
Accords not with the sadness of my suit
LADY GREY:
Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'
KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request,
KING EDWARD IV:
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
LADY GREY:
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not, she
GLOUCESTER:
knits her brows.
CLARENCE:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in
CLARENCE:
Christendom.
KING EDWARD IV:
[Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty,
KING EDWARD IV:
Her words do show her wit incomparable,
KING EDWARD IV:
All her perfections challenge sovereignty
KING EDWARD IV:
One way or other, she is for a king,
KING EDWARD IV:
And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--
KING EDWARD IV:
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
LADY GREY:
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord
LADY GREY:
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
LADY GREY:
But far unfit to be a sovereign.
KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
KING EDWARD IV:
I speak no more than what my soul intends,
KING EDWARD IV:
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
LADY GREY:
And that is more than I will yield unto
LADY GREY:
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
LADY GREY:
And yet too good to be your concubine.
KING EDWARD IV:
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
LADY GREY:
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
KING EDWARD IV:
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
KING EDWARD IV:
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children,
KING EDWARD IV:
And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
KING EDWARD IV:
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
KING EDWARD IV:
To be the father unto many sons.
KING EDWARD IV:
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done
GLOUCESTER:
his shrift.
CLARENCE:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver,
CLARENCE:
'twas for shift.
KING EDWARD IV:
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
GLOUCESTER:
The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
KING EDWARD IV:
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
CLARENCE:
To whom, my lord?
KING EDWARD IV:
Why, Clarence, to myself.
GLOUCESTER:
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
CLARENCE:
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
GLOUCESTER:
By so much is the wonder in extremes.
KING EDWARD IV:
Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
KING EDWARD IV:
Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
KING EDWARD IV:
Enter a Nobleman
Nobleman:
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
Nobleman:
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
KING EDWARD IV:
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower
KING EDWARD IV:
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
KING EDWARD IV:
To question of his apprehension.
KING EDWARD IV:
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
GLOUCESTER:
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
GLOUCESTER:
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
GLOUCESTER:
To cross me from the golden time I look for!
GLOUCESTER:
And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
GLOUCESTER:
The lustful Edward's title buried--
GLOUCESTER:
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
GLOUCESTER:
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
GLOUCESTER:
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself
GLOUCESTER:
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
GLOUCESTER:
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty,
GLOUCESTER:
Like one that stands upon a promontory,
GLOUCESTER:
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
GLOUCESTER:
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
GLOUCESTER:
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
GLOUCESTER:
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way
GLOUCESTER:
So do I wish the crown, being so far off,
GLOUCESTER:
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it,
GLOUCESTER:
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
GLOUCESTER:
Flattering me with impossibilities.
GLOUCESTER:
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
GLOUCESTER:
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
GLOUCESTER:
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard,
GLOUCESTER:
What other pleasure can the world afford?
GLOUCESTER:
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
GLOUCESTER:
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
GLOUCESTER:
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
GLOUCESTER:
O miserable thought! and more unlikely
GLOUCESTER:
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
GLOUCESTER:
Why, love forswore me in my  mother's womb
GLOUCESTER:
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
GLOUCESTER:
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
GLOUCESTER:
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub,
GLOUCESTER:
To make an envious mountain on my back,
GLOUCESTER:
Where sits deformity to mock my body,
GLOUCESTER:
To shape my legs of an unequal size,
GLOUCESTER:
To disproportion me in every part,
GLOUCESTER:
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
GLOUCESTER:
That carries no impression like the dam.
GLOUCESTER:
And am I then a man to be beloved?
GLOUCESTER:
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
GLOUCESTER:
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
GLOUCESTER:
But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
GLOUCESTER:
As are of better person than myself,
GLOUCESTER:
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
GLOUCESTER:
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
GLOUCESTER:
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
GLOUCESTER:
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
GLOUCESTER:
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
GLOUCESTER:
For many lives stand between me and home
GLOUCESTER:
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
GLOUCESTER:
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
GLOUCESTER:
Seeking a way and straying from the way,
GLOUCESTER:
Not knowing how to find the open air,
GLOUCESTER:
But toiling desperately to find it out,--
GLOUCESTER:
Torment myself to catch the English crown
GLOUCESTER:
And from that torment I will free myself,
GLOUCESTER:
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
GLOUCESTER:
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
GLOUCESTER:
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
GLOUCESTER:
And frame my face to all occasions.
GLOUCESTER:
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall,
GLOUCESTER:
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk,
GLOUCESTER:
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
GLOUCESTER:
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
GLOUCESTER:
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
GLOUCESTER:
I can add colours to the chameleon,
GLOUCESTER:
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
GLOUCESTER:
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
GLOUCESTER:
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
GLOUCESTER:
Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE III. France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.
GLOUCESTER:
Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,  his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN  MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and riseth up again
KING LEWIS XI:
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
KING LEWIS XI:
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
KING LEWIS XI:
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
QUEEN MARGARET:
No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
QUEEN MARGARET:
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
QUEEN MARGARET:
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Great Albion's queen in former golden days
QUEEN MARGARET:
But now mischance hath trod my title down,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And with dishonour laid me on the ground,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And to my humble seat conform myself.
KING LEWIS XI:
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
QUEEN MARGARET:
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
QUEEN MARGARET:
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
KING LEWIS XI:
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
KING LEWIS XI:
And sit thee by our side
KING LEWIS XI:
Seats her by him
KING LEWIS XI:
Yield not thy neck
KING LEWIS XI:
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
KING LEWIS XI:
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
KING LEWIS XI:
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief,
KING LEWIS XI:
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
QUEEN MARGARET:
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Is of a king become a banish'd man,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn,
QUEEN MARGARET:
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
QUEEN MARGARET:
Usurps the regal title and the seat
QUEEN MARGARET:
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
QUEEN MARGARET:
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
QUEEN MARGARET:
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done
QUEEN MARGARET:
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Our people and our peers are both misled,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
KING LEWIS XI:
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
KING LEWIS XI:
While we bethink a means to break it off.
QUEEN MARGARET:
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
KING LEWIS XI:
The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Enter WARWICK
KING LEWIS XI:
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
KING LEWIS XI:
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
KING LEWIS XI:
He descends. She ariseth
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
WARWICK:
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
WARWICK:
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
WARWICK:
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
WARWICK:
First, to do greetings to thy royal person,
WARWICK:
And then to crave a league of amity,
WARWICK:
And lastly, to confirm that amity
WARWICK:
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
WARWICK:
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
WARWICK:
To England's king in lawful marriage.
QUEEN MARGARET:
[Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
WARWICK:
[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
WARWICK:
I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
WARWICK:
Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
WARWICK:
To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart,
WARWICK:
Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,
WARWICK:
Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
QUEEN MARGARET:
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
QUEEN MARGARET:
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
QUEEN MARGARET:
But from deceit bred by necessity,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For how can tyrants safely govern home,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
QUEEN MARGARET:
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
WARWICK:
Injurious Margaret!
PRINCE EDWARD:
And why not queen?
WARWICK:
Because thy father Henry did usurp,
WARWICK:
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
OXFORD:
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
OXFORD:
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain,
OXFORD:
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
OXFORD:
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest,
OXFORD:
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
OXFORD:
Who by his prowess conquered all France
OXFORD:
From these our Henry lineally descends.
WARWICK:
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
WARWICK:
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
WARWICK:
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
WARWICK:
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
WARWICK:
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
WARWICK:
Of threescore and two years, a silly time
WARWICK:
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
OXFORD:
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
OXFORD:
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
OXFORD:
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
WARWICK:
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
WARWICK:
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
WARWICK:
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
OXFORD:
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
OXFORD:
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
OXFORD:
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
OXFORD:
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
OXFORD:
When nature brought him to the door of death?
OXFORD:
No, Warwick, no, while life upholds this arm,
OXFORD:
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
WARWICK:
And I the house of York.
KING LEWIS XI:
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
KING LEWIS XI:
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
KING LEWIS XI:
While I use further conference with Warwick.
KING LEWIS XI:
They stand aloof
QUEEN MARGARET:
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
KING LEWIS XI:
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
KING LEWIS XI:
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
KING LEWIS XI:
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
WARWICK:
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious in the people's eye?
WARWICK:
The more that Henry was unfortunate.
KING LEWIS XI:
Then further, all dissembling set aside,
KING LEWIS XI:
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
KING LEWIS XI:
Unto our sister Bona.
WARWICK:
Such it seems
WARWICK:
As may beseem a monarch like himself.
WARWICK:
Myself have often heard him say and swear
WARWICK:
That this his love was an eternal plant,
WARWICK:
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
WARWICK:
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
WARWICK:
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
WARWICK:
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
KING LEWIS XI:
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
BONA:
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine
BONA:
To WARWICK
BONA:
Yet I confess that often ere this day,
BONA:
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
BONA:
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
KING LEWIS XI:
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's,
KING LEWIS XI:
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
KING LEWIS XI:
Touching the jointure that your king must make,
KING LEWIS XI:
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
KING LEWIS XI:
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
KING LEWIS XI:
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not to the English king.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
QUEEN MARGARET:
By this alliance to make void my suit
QUEEN MARGARET:
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
KING LEWIS XI:
And still is friend to him and Margaret
KING LEWIS XI:
But if your title to the crown be weak,
KING LEWIS XI:
As may appear by Edward's good success,
KING LEWIS XI:
Then 'tis but reason that I be released
KING LEWIS XI:
From giving aid which late I promised.
KING LEWIS XI:
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
KING LEWIS XI:
That your estate requires and mine can yield.
WARWICK:
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
WARWICK:
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
WARWICK:
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
WARWICK:
You have a father able to maintain you,
WARWICK:
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
QUEEN MARGARET:
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Post blows a horn within
KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
KING LEWIS XI:
Enter a Post
Post:
[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
Post:
Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague
Post:
To KING LEWIS XI
Post:
These from our king unto your majesty
Post:
To QUEEN MARGARET
Post:
And, madam, these for you, from whom I know not.
Post:
They all read their letters
OXFORD:
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
OXFORD:
Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled
PRINCE EDWARD:
I hope all's for the best.
KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.
WARWICK:
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
KING LEWIS XI:
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
KING LEWIS XI:
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
KING LEWIS XI:
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
KING LEWIS XI:
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
KING LEWIS XI:
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
QUEEN MARGARET:
I told your majesty as much before
QUEEN MARGARET:
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
WARWICK:
King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
WARWICK:
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
WARWICK:
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
WARWICK:
No more my king, for he dishonours me,
WARWICK:
But most himself, if he could see his shame.
WARWICK:
Did I forget that by the house of York
WARWICK:
My father came untimely to his death?
WARWICK:
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
WARWICK:
Did I impale him with the regal crown?
WARWICK:
Did I put Henry from his native right?
WARWICK:
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
WARWICK:
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour
WARWICK:
And to repair my honour lost for him,
WARWICK:
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
WARWICK:
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
WARWICK:
And henceforth I am thy true servitor
WARWICK:
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
WARWICK:
And replant Henry in his former state.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.
WARWICK:
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
WARWICK:
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
WARWICK:
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
WARWICK:
I'll undertake to land them on our coast
WARWICK:
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
WARWICK:
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him
WARWICK:
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
WARWICK:
He's very likely now to fall from him,
WARWICK:
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
WARWICK:
Or than for strength and safety of our country.
BONA:
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
BONA:
But by thy help to this distressed queen?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
BONA:
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
WARWICK:
And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
KING LEWIS XI:
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
KING LEWIS XI:
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
KING LEWIS XI:
You shall have aid.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
KING LEWIS XI:
Then, England's messenger, return in post,
KING LEWIS XI:
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
KING LEWIS XI:
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
KING LEWIS XI:
To revel it with him and his new bride
KING LEWIS XI:
Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.
BONA:
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
BONA:
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And I am ready to put armour on.
WARWICK:
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
WARWICK:
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
WARWICK:
There's thy reward: be gone.
WARWICK:
Exit Post
KING LEWIS XI:
But, Warwick,
KING LEWIS XI:
Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
KING LEWIS XI:
Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle,
KING LEWIS XI:
And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
KING LEWIS XI:
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
KING LEWIS XI:
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
KING LEWIS XI:
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
WARWICK:
This shall assure my constant loyalty,
WARWICK:
That if our queen and this young prince agree,
WARWICK:
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
WARWICK:
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,
PRINCE EDWARD:
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.
PRINCE EDWARD:
He gives his hand to WARWICK
KING LEWIS XI:
Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
KING LEWIS XI:
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
KING LEWIS XI:
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
KING LEWIS XI:
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
KING LEWIS XI:
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
KING LEWIS XI:
Exeunt all but WARWICK
WARWICK:
I came from Edward as ambassador,
WARWICK:
But I return his sworn and mortal foe
WARWICK:
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
WARWICK:
But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
WARWICK:
Had he none else to make a stale but me?
WARWICK:
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
WARWICK:
I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
WARWICK:
And I'll be chief to bring him down again
WARWICK:
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
WARWICK:
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
WARWICK:
Exit
WARWICK:
ACT IV
WARWICK:
SCENE I. London. The palace.
WARWICK:
Enter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE
GLOUCESTER:
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
GLOUCESTER:
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
GLOUCESTER:
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
CLARENCE:
Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France,
CLARENCE:
How could he stay till Warwick made return?
SOMERSET:
My lords, forbear this talk, here comes the king.
GLOUCESTER:
And his well-chosen bride.
CLARENCE:
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
CLARENCE:
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, attended, QUEEN ELIZABETH, PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS, and others
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
KING EDWARD IV:
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?
CLARENCE:
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
CLARENCE:
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
CLARENCE:
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
KING EDWARD IV:
Suppose they take offence without a cause,
KING EDWARD IV:
They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
KING EDWARD IV:
Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
GLOUCESTER:
And shall have your will, because our king
GLOUCESTER:
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
GLOUCESTER:
Not I
GLOUCESTER:
No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd
GLOUCESTER:
Whom God hath join'd together, ay, and 'twere pity
GLOUCESTER:
To sunder them that yoke so well together.
KING EDWARD IV:
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
KING EDWARD IV:
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
KING EDWARD IV:
Should not become my wife and England's queen.
KING EDWARD IV:
And you too, Somerset and Montague,
KING EDWARD IV:
Speak freely what you think.
CLARENCE:
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
CLARENCE:
Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
CLARENCE:
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
GLOUCESTER:
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.
KING EDWARD IV:
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
KING EDWARD IV:
By such invention as I can devise?
MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance
MONTAGUE:
Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
MONTAGUE:
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
HASTINGS:
Why, knows not Montague that of itself
HASTINGS:
England is safe, if true within itself?
MONTAGUE:
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
HASTINGS:
'Tis better using France than trusting France
HASTINGS:
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
HASTINGS:
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
HASTINGS:
And with their helps only defend ourselves,
HASTINGS:
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
CLARENCE:
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
CLARENCE:
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant,
KING EDWARD IV:
And for this once my will shall stand for law.
GLOUCESTER:
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
GLOUCESTER:
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
GLOUCESTER:
Unto the brother of your loving bride,
GLOUCESTER:
She better would have fitted me or Clarence
GLOUCESTER:
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.
CLARENCE:
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
CLARENCE:
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
CLARENCE:
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
KING EDWARD IV:
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
KING EDWARD IV:
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.
CLARENCE:
In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
CLARENCE:
Which being shallow, you give me leave
CLARENCE:
To play the broker in mine own behalf,
CLARENCE:
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
KING EDWARD IV:
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
KING EDWARD IV:
And not be tied unto his brother's will.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lords, before it pleased his majesty
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To raise my state to title of a queen,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Do me but right, and you must all confess
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That I was not ignoble of descent,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But as this title honours me and mine,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.
KING EDWARD IV:
My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns
KING EDWARD IV:
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
KING EDWARD IV:
So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
KING EDWARD IV:
And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
KING EDWARD IV:
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands,
KING EDWARD IV:
Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
KING EDWARD IV:
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside]  I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter a Post
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, messenger, what letters or what news
KING EDWARD IV:
From France?
Post:
My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,
Post:
But such as I, without your special pardon,
Post:
Dare not relate.
KING EDWARD IV:
Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
KING EDWARD IV:
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
KING EDWARD IV:
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
Post:
At my depart, these were his very words
Post:
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
Post:
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
Post:
To revel it with him and his new bride.'
KING EDWARD IV:
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
KING EDWARD IV:
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
Post:
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain
Post:
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
Post:
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'
KING EDWARD IV:
I blame not her, she could say little less,
KING EDWARD IV:
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
KING EDWARD IV:
For I have heard that she was there in place.
Post:
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
Post:
And I am ready to put armour on.'
KING EDWARD IV:
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
KING EDWARD IV:
But what said Warwick to these injuries?
Post:
He, more incensed against your majesty
Post:
Than all the rest, discharged me with these words
Post:
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
Post:
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'
KING EDWARD IV:
Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
KING EDWARD IV:
Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd
KING EDWARD IV:
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
KING EDWARD IV:
But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?
Post:
Ay, gracious sovereign, they are so link'd in
Post:
friendship
Post:
That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.
CLARENCE:
Belike the elder, Clarence will have the younger.
CLARENCE:
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
CLARENCE:
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter,
CLARENCE:
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
CLARENCE:
I may not prove inferior to yourself.
CLARENCE:
You that love me and Warwick, follow me.
CLARENCE:
Exit CLARENCE, and SOMERSET follows
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside]  Not I
GLOUCESTER:
My thoughts aim at a further matter, I
GLOUCESTER:
Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.
KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
KING EDWARD IV:
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen,
KING EDWARD IV:
And haste is needful in this desperate case.
KING EDWARD IV:
Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
KING EDWARD IV:
Go levy men, and make prepare for war,
KING EDWARD IV:
They are already, or quickly will be landed
KING EDWARD IV:
Myself in person will straight follow you.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD
KING EDWARD IV:
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
KING EDWARD IV:
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
KING EDWARD IV:
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance
KING EDWARD IV:
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
KING EDWARD IV:
If it be so, then both depart to him,
KING EDWARD IV:
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends
KING EDWARD IV:
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
KING EDWARD IV:
Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
KING EDWARD IV:
That I may never have you in suspect.
MONTAGUE:
So God help Montague as he proves true!
HASTINGS:
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
KING EDWARD IV:
Now therefore let us hence, and lose no hour,
KING EDWARD IV:
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt
KING EDWARD IV:
SCENE II. A plain in Warwickshire.
KING EDWARD IV:
Enter WARWICK and OXFORD, with French soldiers
WARWICK:
Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well,
WARWICK:
The common people by numbers swarm to us.
WARWICK:
Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET
WARWICK:
But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
WARWICK:
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?
CLARENCE:
Fear not that, my lord.
WARWICK:
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick,
WARWICK:
And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
WARWICK:
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
WARWICK:
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love,
WARWICK:
Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
WARWICK:
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
WARWICK:
But welcome, sweet Clarence, my daughter shall be thine.
WARWICK:
And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
WARWICK:
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
WARWICK:
His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
WARWICK:
And but attended by a simple guard,
WARWICK:
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
WARWICK:
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy
WARWICK:
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
WARWICK:
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
WARWICK:
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
WARWICK:
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
WARWICK:
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
WARWICK:
And seize himself, I say not, slaughter him,
WARWICK:
For I intend but only to surprise him.
WARWICK:
You that will follow me to this attempt,
WARWICK:
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
WARWICK:
They all cry, 'Henry!'
WARWICK:
Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort
WARWICK:
For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
WARWICK:
Exeunt
WARWICK:
SCENE III. Edward's camp, near Warwick.
WARWICK:
Enter three Watchmen, to guard KING EDWARD IV's tent
First Watchman:
Come on, my masters, each man take his stand
First Watchman:
The king by this is set him down to sleep.
Second Watchman:
What, will he not to bed?
First Watchman:
Why, no, for he hath made a solemn vow
First Watchman:
Never to lie and take his natural rest
First Watchman:
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
Second Watchman:
To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
Second Watchman:
If Warwick be so near as men report.
Third Watchman:
But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
Third Watchman:
That with the king here resteth in his tent?
First Watchman:
'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.
Third Watchman:
O, is it so? But why commands the king
Third Watchman:
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
Third Watchman:
While he himself keeps in the cold field?
Second Watchman:
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
Third Watchman:
Ay, but give me worship and quietness,
Third Watchman:
I like it better than a dangerous honour.
Third Watchman:
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
Third Watchman:
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
First Watchman:
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
Second Watchman:
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
Second Watchman:
But to defend his person from night-foes?
Second Watchman:
Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, and French soldiers, silent all
WARWICK:
This is his tent, and see where stand his guard.
WARWICK:
Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
WARWICK:
But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.
First Watchman:
Who goes there?
Second Watchman:
Stay, or thou diest!
Second Watchman:
WARWICK and the rest cry all, 'Warwick! Warwick!'  and set upon the Guard, who fly, crying, 'Arm! arm!' WARWICK and the rest following them
Second Watchman:
The drum playing and trumpet sounding, reenter  WARWICK, SOMERSET, and the rest, bringing KING  EDWARD IV out in his gown, sitting in a chair. RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage
SOMERSET:
What are they that fly there?
WARWICK:
Richard and Hastings: let them go, here is The duke.
KING EDWARD IV:
The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
KING EDWARD IV:
Thou call'dst me king.
WARWICK:
Ay, but the case is alter'd
WARWICK:
When you disgraced me in my embassade,
WARWICK:
Then I degraded you from being king,
WARWICK:
And come now to create you Duke of York.
WARWICK:
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
WARWICK:
That know not how to use ambassadors,
WARWICK:
Nor how to be contented with one wife,
WARWICK:
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
WARWICK:
Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
WARWICK:
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?
KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.
KING EDWARD IV:
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
KING EDWARD IV:
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
KING EDWARD IV:
Edward will always bear himself as king
KING EDWARD IV:
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
KING EDWARD IV:
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
WARWICK:
Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king
WARWICK:
Takes off his crown
WARWICK:
But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
WARWICK:
And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
WARWICK:
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
WARWICK:
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
WARWICK:
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
WARWICK:
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
WARWICK:
I'll follow you, and tell what answer
WARWICK:
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
WARWICK:
Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
WARWICK:
They lead him out forcibly
KING EDWARD IV:
What fates impose, that men must needs abide,
KING EDWARD IV:
It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exit, guarded
OXFORD:
What now remains, my lords, for us to do
OXFORD:
But march to London with our soldiers?
WARWICK:
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do,
WARWICK:
To free King Henry from imprisonment
WARWICK:
And see him seated in the regal throne.
WARWICK:
Exeunt
WARWICK:
SCENE IV. London. The palace.
WARWICK:
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS
RIVERS:
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
RIVERS:
What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, but the loss of his own royal person.
RIVERS:
Then is my sovereign slain?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Or by his foe surprised at unawares
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And, as I further have to understand,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.
RIVERS:
These news I must confess are full of grief,
RIVERS:
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may
RIVERS:
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And I the rather wean me from despair
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
This is it that makes me bridle passion
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.
RIVERS:
But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To set the crown once more on Henry's head
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Guess thou the rest, King Edward's friends must down,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save at least the heir of Edward's right
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Exeunt
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
SCENE V. A park near Middleham Castle In Yorkshire.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and STANLEY
GLOUCESTER:
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
GLOUCESTER:
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
GLOUCESTER:
Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
GLOUCESTER:
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
GLOUCESTER:
Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
GLOUCESTER:
He hath good usage and great liberty,
GLOUCESTER:
And, often but attended with weak guard,
GLOUCESTER:
Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
GLOUCESTER:
I have advertised him by secret means
GLOUCESTER:
That if about this hour he make his way
GLOUCESTER:
Under the colour of his usual game,
GLOUCESTER:
He shall here find his friends with horse and men
GLOUCESTER:
To set him free from his captivity.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him
Huntsman:
This way, my lord, for this way lies the game.
KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
KING EDWARD IV:
Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?
GLOUCESTER:
Brother, the time and case requireth haste
GLOUCESTER:
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.
KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall we then?
HASTINGS:
To Lynn, my lord,
HASTINGS:
And ship from thence to Flanders.
GLOUCESTER:
Well guess'd, believe me, for that was my meaning.
KING EDWARD IV:
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
GLOUCESTER:
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
KING EDWARD IV:
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
Huntsman:
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
GLOUCESTER:
Come then, away, let's ha' no more ado.
KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown,
KING EDWARD IV:
And pray that I may repossess the crown.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt
KING EDWARD IV:
SCENE VI. London. The Tower.
KING EDWARD IV:
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLARENCE, WARWICK,  SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, and Lieutenant of the Tower
KING HENRY VI:
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
KING HENRY VI:
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
KING HENRY VI:
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
KING HENRY VI:
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
KING HENRY VI:
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
Lieutenant:
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns,
Lieutenant:
But if an humble prayer may prevail,
Lieutenant:
I then crave pardon of your majesty.
KING HENRY VI:
For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
KING HENRY VI:
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
KING HENRY VI:
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure,
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
KING HENRY VI:
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
KING HENRY VI:
At last by notes of household harmony
KING HENRY VI:
They quite forget their loss of liberty.
KING HENRY VI:
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
KING HENRY VI:
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee,
KING HENRY VI:
He was the author, thou the instrument.
KING HENRY VI:
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
KING HENRY VI:
By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
KING HENRY VI:
And that the people of this blessed land
KING HENRY VI:
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
KING HENRY VI:
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
KING HENRY VI:
I here resign my government to thee,
KING HENRY VI:
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
WARWICK:
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous,
WARWICK:
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
WARWICK:
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,
WARWICK:
For few men rightly temper with the stars
WARWICK:
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,
WARWICK:
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
CLARENCE:
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
CLARENCE:
To whom the heavens in thy nativity
CLARENCE:
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
CLARENCE:
As likely to be blest in peace and war,
CLARENCE:
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
WARWICK:
And I choose Clarence only for protector.
KING HENRY VI:
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands
KING HENRY VI:
Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
KING HENRY VI:
That no dissension hinder government
KING HENRY VI:
I make you both protectors of this land,
KING HENRY VI:
While I myself will lead a private life
KING HENRY VI:
And in devotion spend my latter days,
KING HENRY VI:
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
WARWICK:
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
CLARENCE:
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,
CLARENCE:
For on thy fortune I repose myself.
WARWICK:
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content
WARWICK:
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
WARWICK:
To Henry's body, and supply his place,
WARWICK:
I mean, in bearing weight of government,
WARWICK:
While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
WARWICK:
And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
WARWICK:
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,
WARWICK:
And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
CLARENCE:
What else? and that succession be determined.
WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
KING HENRY VI:
But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
KING HENRY VI:
Let me entreat, for I command no more,
KING HENRY VI:
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
KING HENRY VI:
Be sent for, to return from France with speed,
KING HENRY VI:
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
KING HENRY VI:
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.
CLARENCE:
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
KING HENRY VI:
Of whom you seem to have so tender care?
SOMERSET:
My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.
KING HENRY VI:
Come hither, England's hope.
KING HENRY VI:
Lays his hand on his head
KING HENRY VI:
If secret powers
KING HENRY VI:
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
KING HENRY VI:
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
KING HENRY VI:
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
KING HENRY VI:
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
KING HENRY VI:
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
KING HENRY VI:
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
KING HENRY VI:
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
KING HENRY VI:
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter a Post
WARWICK:
What news, my friend?
Post:
That Edward is escaped from your brother,
Post:
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.
WARWICK:
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
Post:
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
Post:
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
Post:
In secret ambush on the forest side
Post:
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him,
Post:
For hunting was his daily exercise.
WARWICK:
My brother was too careless of his charge.
WARWICK:
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
WARWICK:
A salve for any sore that may betide.
WARWICK:
Exeunt all but SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, and OXFORD
SOMERSET:
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's,
SOMERSET:
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
SOMERSET:
And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
SOMERSET:
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
SOMERSET:
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
SOMERSET:
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
SOMERSET:
What may befall him, to his harm and ours
SOMERSET:
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
SOMERSET:
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
SOMERSET:
Till storms be past of civil enmity.
OXFORD:
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
OXFORD:
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
SOMERSET:
It shall be so, he shall to Brittany.
SOMERSET:
Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.
SOMERSET:
Exeunt
SOMERSET:
SCENE VII. Before York.
SOMERSET:
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and Soldiers
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
KING EDWARD IV:
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
KING EDWARD IV:
And says that once more I shall interchange
KING EDWARD IV:
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
KING EDWARD IV:
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
KING EDWARD IV:
And brought desired help from Burgundy
KING EDWARD IV:
What then remains, we being thus arrived
KING EDWARD IV:
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
KING EDWARD IV:
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?
GLOUCESTER:
The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this,
GLOUCESTER:
For many men that stumble at the threshold
GLOUCESTER:
Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us
KING EDWARD IV:
By fair or foul means we must enter in,
KING EDWARD IV:
For hither will our friends repair to us.
HASTINGS:
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
HASTINGS:
Enter, on the walls, the Mayor of York, and his Brethren
Mayor:
My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
Mayor:
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,
Mayor:
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
KING EDWARD IV:
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
KING EDWARD IV:
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
Mayor:
True, my good lord, I know you for no less.
KING EDWARD IV:
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
KING EDWARD IV:
As being well content with that alone.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside]  But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
GLOUCESTER:
He'll soon find means to make the body follow.
HASTINGS:
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
HASTINGS:
Open the gates, we are King Henry's friends.
Mayor:
Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.
Mayor:
They descend
GLOUCESTER:
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
HASTINGS:
The good old man would fain that all were well,
HASTINGS:
So 'twere not 'long of him, but being enter'd,
HASTINGS:
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
HASTINGS:
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
HASTINGS:
Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen, below
KING EDWARD IV:
So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
KING EDWARD IV:
But in the night or in the time of war.
KING EDWARD IV:
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys,
KING EDWARD IV:
Takes his keys
KING EDWARD IV:
For Edward will defend the town and thee,
KING EDWARD IV:
And all those friends that deign to follow me.
KING EDWARD IV:
March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers
GLOUCESTER:
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
GLOUCESTER:
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.
KING EDWARD IV:
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?
MONTAGUE:
To help King Edward in his time of storm,
MONTAGUE:
As every loyal subject ought to do.
KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, good Montgomery, but we now forget
KING EDWARD IV:
Our title to the crown and only claim
KING EDWARD IV:
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
MONTAGUE:
Then fare you well, for I will hence again
MONTAGUE:
I came to serve a king and not a duke.
MONTAGUE:
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
MONTAGUE:
The drum begins to march
KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhi le, and we'll debate
KING EDWARD IV:
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
MONTAGUE:
What talk you of debating? in few words,
MONTAGUE:
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
MONTAGUE:
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
MONTAGUE:
To keep them back that come to succor you
MONTAGUE:
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
GLOUCESTER:
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
KING EDWARD IV:
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim
KING EDWARD IV:
Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
HASTINGS:
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
GLOUCESTER:
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
GLOUCESTER:
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand
GLOUCESTER:
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
KING EDWARD IV:
Then be it as you will, for 'tis my right,
KING EDWARD IV:
And Henry but usurps the diadem.
MONTAGUE:
Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself,
MONTAGUE:
And now will I be Edward's champion.
HASTINGS:
Sound trumpet, Edward shall be here proclaim'd
HASTINGS:
Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.
HASTINGS:
Flourish
Soldier:
Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
Soldier:
England and France, and lord of Ireland,  and c.
MONTAGUE:
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
MONTAGUE:
By this I challenge him to single fight.
MONTAGUE:
Throws down his gauntlet
All:
Long live Edward the Fourth!
KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all
KING EDWARD IV:
If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York,
KING EDWARD IV:
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
KING EDWARD IV:
Above the border of this horizon,
KING EDWARD IV:
We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates,
KING EDWARD IV:
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
KING EDWARD IV:
Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
KING EDWARD IV:
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
KING EDWARD IV:
Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
KING EDWARD IV:
Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,
KING EDWARD IV:
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt
KING EDWARD IV:
SCENE VIII. London. The palace.
KING EDWARD IV:
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, WARWICK, MONTAGUE, CLARENCE, EXETER, and OXFORD
WARWICK:
What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
WARWICK:
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
WARWICK:
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
WARWICK:
And with his troops doth march amain to London,
WARWICK:
And many giddy people flock to him.
KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy men, and beat him back again.
CLARENCE:
A little fire is quickly trodden out,
CLARENCE:
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
WARWICK:
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
WARWICK:
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war,
WARWICK:
Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,
WARWICK:
Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
WARWICK:
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee
WARWICK:
Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
WARWICK:
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
WARWICK:
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st
WARWICK:
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,
WARWICK:
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
WARWICK:
My sovereign, with the loving citizens,
WARWICK:
Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
WARWICK:
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
WARWICK:
Shall rest in London till we come to him.
WARWICK:
Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.
WARWICK:
Farewell, my sovereign.
KING HENRY VI:
Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.
CLARENCE:
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.
KING HENRY VI:
Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
MONTAGUE:
Comfort, my lord, and so I take my leave.
OXFORD:
And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.
KING HENRY VI:
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
KING HENRY VI:
And all at once, once more a happy farewell.
WARWICK:
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.
WARWICK:
Exeunt all but KING HENRY VI and EXETER
KING HENRY VI:
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
KING HENRY VI:
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
KING HENRY VI:
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
KING HENRY VI:
Should not be able to encounter mine.
EXETER:
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
KING HENRY VI:
That's not my fear, my meed hath got me fame
KING HENRY VI:
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
KING HENRY VI:
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays,
KING HENRY VI:
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
KING HENRY VI:
My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
KING HENRY VI:
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears,
KING HENRY VI:
I have not been desirous of their wealth,
KING HENRY VI:
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.
KING HENRY VI:
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd
KING HENRY VI:
Then why should they love Edward more than me?
KING HENRY VI:
No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace
KING HENRY VI:
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
KING HENRY VI:
The lamb will never cease to follow him.
KING HENRY VI:
Shout within. 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!'
EXETER:
Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?
EXETER:
Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers
KING EDWARD IV:
Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence,
KING EDWARD IV:
And once again proclaim us King of England.
KING EDWARD IV:
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
KING EDWARD IV:
Now stops thy spring, my sea sha$l suck them dry,
KING EDWARD IV:
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
KING EDWARD IV:
Hence with him to the Tower, let him not speak.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI
KING EDWARD IV:
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
KING EDWARD IV:
Where peremptory Warwick now remains
KING EDWARD IV:
The sun shines hot, and, if we use delay,
KING EDWARD IV:
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.
GLOUCESTER:
Away betimes, before his forces join,
GLOUCESTER:
And take the great-grown traitor unawares
GLOUCESTER:
Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt
GLOUCESTER:
ACT V
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE I. Coventry.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter WARWICK, the Mayor of Coventry, two Messengers, and others upon the walls
WARWICK:
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
WARWICK:
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?
First Messenger:
By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
WARWICK:
How far off is our brother Montague?
WARWICK:
Where is the post that came from Montague?
Second Messenger:
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
Second Messenger:
Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE
WARWICK:
Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
WARWICK:
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?
SOMERSET:
At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
SOMERSET:
And do expect him here some two hours hence.
SOMERSET:
Drum heard
WARWICK:
Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
SOMERSET:
It is not his, my lord, here Southam lies
SOMERSET:
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
WARWICK:
Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.
SOMERSET:
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
SOMERSET:
March: flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers
KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
GLOUCESTER:
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
WARWICK:
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
WARWICK:
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
WARWICK:
That we could hear no news of his repair?
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
KING EDWARD IV:
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
KING EDWARD IV:
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
KING EDWARD IV:
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
WARWICK:
Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
WARWICK:
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
WARWICK:
Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
WARWICK:
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
GLOUCESTER:
I thought, at least, he would have said the king,
GLOUCESTER:
Or did he make the jest against his will?
WARWICK:
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give
GLOUCESTER:
I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
WARWICK:
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
KING EDWARD IV:
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
WARWICK:
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight
WARWICK:
And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again,
WARWICK:
And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.
KING EDWARD IV:
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner
KING EDWARD IV:
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this
KING EDWARD IV:
What is the body when the head is off?
GLOUCESTER:
Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
GLOUCESTER:
But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
GLOUCESTER:
The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
GLOUCESTER:
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
GLOUCESTER:
And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.
EDWARD:
'Tis even so, yet you are Warwick still.
GLOUCESTER:
Come, Warwick, take the time, kneel down, kneel down
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
WARWICK:
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
WARWICK:
And with the other fling it at thy face,
WARWICK:
Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.
KING EDWARD IV:
Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
KING EDWARD IV:
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
KING EDWARD IV:
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
KING EDWARD IV:
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
KING EDWARD IV:
'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'
KING EDWARD IV:
Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours
WARWICK:
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
OXFORD:
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
OXFORD:
He and his forces enter the city
GLOUCESTER:
The gates are open, let us enter too.
KING EDWARD IV:
So other foes may set upon our backs.
KING EDWARD IV:
Stand we in good array, for they no doubt
KING EDWARD IV:
Will issue out again and bid us battle
KING EDWARD IV:
If not, the city being but of small defence,
KING EDWARD IV:
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
WARWICK:
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
WARWICK:
Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours
MONTAGUE:
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
MONTAGUE:
He and his forces enter the city
GLOUCESTER:
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
GLOUCESTER:
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
KING EDWARD IV:
The harder match'd, the greater victory
KING EDWARD IV:
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
KING EDWARD IV:
Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours
SOMERSET:
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
SOMERSET:
He and his forces enter the city
GLOUCESTER:
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
GLOUCESTER:
Have sold their lives unto the house of York,
GLOUCESTER:
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours
WARWICK:
And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
WARWICK:
Of force enough to bid his brother battle,
WARWICK:
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
WARWICK:
More than the nature of a brother's love!
WARWICK:
Come, Clarence, come, thou wilt, if Warwick call.
CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
CLARENCE:
Taking his red rose out of his hat
CLARENCE:
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
CLARENCE:
I will not ruinate my father's house,
CLARENCE:
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
CLARENCE:
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
CLARENCE:
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
CLARENCE:
To bend the fatal instruments of war
CLARENCE:
Against his brother and his lawful king?
CLARENCE:
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
CLARENCE:
To keep that oath were more impiety
CLARENCE:
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
CLARENCE:
I am so sorry for my trespass made
CLARENCE:
That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
CLARENCE:
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
CLARENCE:
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
CLARENCE:
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
CLARENCE:
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
CLARENCE:
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
CLARENCE:
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
CLARENCE:
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends
CLARENCE:
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
CLARENCE:
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.
KING EDWARD IV:
Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
KING EDWARD IV:
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.
GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, good Clarence, this is brotherlike.
WARWICK:
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
KING EDWARD IV:
What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
KING EDWARD IV:
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
WARWICK:
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
WARWICK:
I will away towards Barnet presently,
WARWICK:
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.
KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
KING EDWARD IV:
Lords, to the field, Saint George and victory!
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick and his company follow
KING EDWARD IV:
SCENE II. A field of battle near Barnet.
KING EDWARD IV:
Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD IV, bringing forth WARWICK wounded
KING EDWARD IV:
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear,
KING EDWARD IV:
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, Montague, sit fast, I seek for thee,
KING EDWARD IV:
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exit
WARWICK:
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
WARWICK:
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
WARWICK:
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
WARWICK:
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
WARWICK:
That I must yield my body to the earth
WARWICK:
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
WARWICK:
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
WARWICK:
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
WARWICK:
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
WARWICK:
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
WARWICK:
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
WARWICK:
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
WARWICK:
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
WARWICK:
To search the secret treasons of the world
WARWICK:
The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
WARWICK:
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres,
WARWICK:
For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
WARWICK:
And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
WARWICK:
Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
WARWICK:
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
WARWICK:
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
WARWICK:
Is nothing left me but my body's length.
WARWICK:
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
WARWICK:
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.
WARWICK:
Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET
SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
SOMERSET:
We might recover all our loss again,
SOMERSET:
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power
SOMERSET:
Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!
WARWICK:
Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
WARWICK:
If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
WARWICK:
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
WARWICK:
Thou lovest me not, for, brother, if thou didst,
WARWICK:
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
WARWICK:
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
WARWICK:
Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.
SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last,
SOMERSET:
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
SOMERSET:
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
SOMERSET:
And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
SOMERSET:
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
SOMERSET:
That mought not be distinguished, but at last
SOMERSET:
I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
SOMERSET:
'O, farewell, Warwick!'
WARWICK:
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves,
WARWICK:
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.
WARWICK:
Dies
OXFORD:
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
OXFORD:
Here they bear away his body. Exeunt
OXFORD:
SCENE III. Another part of the field.
OXFORD:
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV in triumph, with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest
KING EDWARD IV:
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
KING EDWARD IV:
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
KING EDWARD IV:
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
KING EDWARD IV:
I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
KING EDWARD IV:
That will encounter with our glorious sun,
KING EDWARD IV:
Ere he attain his easeful western bed
KING EDWARD IV:
I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
KING EDWARD IV:
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
KING EDWARD IV:
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
CLARENCE:
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
CLARENCE:
And blow it to the source from whence it came
CLARENCE:
The very beams will dry those vapours up,
CLARENCE:
For every cloud engenders not a storm.
GLOUCESTER:
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
GLOUCESTER:
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her
GLOUCESTER:
If she have time to breathe be well assured
GLOUCESTER:
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
KING EDWARD IV:
We are advertised by our loving friends
KING EDWARD IV:
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury
KING EDWARD IV:
We, having now the best at Barnet field,
KING EDWARD IV:
Will thither straight, for willingness rids way,
KING EDWARD IV:
And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
KING EDWARD IV:
In every county as we go along.
KING EDWARD IV:
Strike up the drum, cry 'Courage!' and away.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt
KING EDWARD IV:
SCENE IV. Plains near Tewksbury.
KING EDWARD IV:
March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET, OXFORD, and soldiers
QUEEN MARGARET:
Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
QUEEN MARGARET:
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What though the mast be now blown overboard,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
QUEEN MARGARET:
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
QUEEN MARGARET:
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
QUEEN MARGARET:
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Which industry and courage might have saved?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Say Warwick was our anchor, what of that?
QUEEN MARGARET:
And Montague our topmost, what of him?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles, what of these?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
QUEEN MARGARET:
And Somerset another goodly mast?
QUEEN MARGARET:
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
QUEEN MARGARET:
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
QUEEN MARGARET:
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
QUEEN MARGARET:
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
QUEEN MARGARET:
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
QUEEN MARGARET:
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
QUEEN MARGARET:
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
QUEEN MARGARET:
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
QUEEN MARGARET:
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
QUEEN MARGARET:
All these the enemies to our poor bark.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Say you can swim, alas, 'tis but a while!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Tread on the sand, why, there you quickly sink
QUEEN MARGARET:
Bestride the rock, the tide will wash you off,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or else you famish, that's a threefold death.
QUEEN MARGARET:
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
QUEEN MARGARET:
If case some one of you would fly from us,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
QUEEN MARGARET:
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided
QUEEN MARGARET:
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
PRINCE EDWARD:
Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Infuse his breast with magnanimity
PRINCE EDWARD:
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
PRINCE EDWARD:
I speak not this as doubting any here
PRINCE EDWARD:
For did I but suspect a fearful man
PRINCE EDWARD:
He should have leave to go away betimes,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Lest in our need he might infect another
PRINCE EDWARD:
And make him of like spirit to himself.
PRINCE EDWARD:
If any such be here--as God forbid!--
PRINCE EDWARD:
Let him depart before we need his help.
OXFORD:
Women and children of so high a courage,
OXFORD:
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
OXFORD:
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
OXFORD:
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
OXFORD:
To bear his image and renew his glories!
SOMERSET:
And he that will not fight for such a hope.
SOMERSET:
Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
SOMERSET:
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thanks, gentle Somerset, sweet Oxford, thanks.
PRINCE EDWARD:
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
Messenger:
Ready to fight, therefore be resolute.
OXFORD:
I thought no less: it is his policy
OXFORD:
To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.
SOMERSET:
But he's deceived, we are in readiness.
QUEEN MARGARET:
This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
OXFORD:
Here pitch our battle, hence we will not budge.
OXFORD:
Flourish and march. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and soldiers
KING EDWARD IV:
Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
KING EDWARD IV:
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,
KING EDWARD IV:
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
KING EDWARD IV:
I need not add more fuel to your fire,
KING EDWARD IV:
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
KING EDWARD IV:
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
QUEEN MARGARET:
My tears gainsay, for every word I speak,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Is prisoner to the foe, his state usurp'd,
QUEEN MARGARET:
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
QUEEN MARGARET:
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
QUEEN MARGARET:
You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Be valiant and give signal to the fight.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Alarum. Retreat. Excursions. Exeunt
QUEEN MARGARET:
SCENE V. Another part of the field.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE,  and soldiers, with QUEEN MARGARET, OXFORD, and SOMERSET, prisoners
KING EDWARD IV:
Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
KING EDWARD IV:
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight
KING EDWARD IV:
For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
KING EDWARD IV:
Go, bear them hence, I will not hear them speak.
OXFORD:
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
SOMERSET:
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
SOMERSET:
Exeunt Oxford and Somerset, guarded
QUEEN MARGARET:
So part we sadly in this troublous world,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.
KING EDWARD IV:
Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
KING EDWARD IV:
Shall have a high reward, and he his life?
GLOUCESTER:
It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!
GLOUCESTER:
Enter soldiers, with PRINCE EDWARD
KING EDWARD IV:
Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
KING EDWARD IV:
What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
KING EDWARD IV:
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
KING EDWARD IV:
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
KING EDWARD IV:
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
PRINCE EDWARD:
Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
PRINCE EDWARD:
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,
PRINCE EDWARD:
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!
GLOUCESTER:
That you might still have worn the petticoat,
GLOUCESTER:
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night,
PRINCE EDWARD:
His currish riddles sort not with this place.
GLOUCESTER:
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
GLOUCESTER:
For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
KING EDWARD IV:
Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
CLARENCE:
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
PRINCE EDWARD:
I know my duty, you are all undutiful
PRINCE EDWARD:
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
PRINCE EDWARD:
And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
PRINCE EDWARD:
I am your better, traitors as ye are
PRINCE EDWARD:
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
KING EDWARD IV:
Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.
KING EDWARD IV:
Stabs him
GLOUCESTER:
Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.
GLOUCESTER:
Stabs him
CLARENCE:
And there's for twitting me with perjury.
CLARENCE:
Stabs him
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, kill me too!
GLOUCESTER:
Marry, and shall.
GLOUCESTER:
Offers to kill her
KING EDWARD IV:
Hold, Richard, hold, for we have done too much.
GLOUCESTER:
Why should she live, to fill the world with words?
KING EDWARD IV:
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.
GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother,
GLOUCESTER:
I'll hence to London on a serious matter
GLOUCESTER:
Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
CLARENCE:
What? what?
GLOUCESTER:
The Tower, the Tower.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
QUEEN MARGARET:
O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
QUEEN MARGARET:
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
QUEEN MARGARET:
If this foul deed were by to equal it
QUEEN MARGARET:
He was a man, this, in respect, a child
QUEEN MARGARET:
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?
QUEEN MARGARET:
No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak
QUEEN MARGARET:
And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
QUEEN MARGARET:
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
QUEEN MARGARET:
You have no children, butchers! if you had,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse
QUEEN MARGARET:
But if you ever chance to have a child,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
QUEEN MARGARET:
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!
KING EDWARD IV:
Away with her, go, bear her hence perforce.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death
QUEEN MARGARET:
What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.
CLARENCE:
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Good Clarence, do, sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
CLARENCE:
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself
QUEEN MARGARET:
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
KING EDWARD IV:
Away, I say, I charge ye, bear her hence.
QUEEN MARGARET:
So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Exit, led out forcibly
KING EDWARD IV:
Where's Richard gone?
CLARENCE:
To London, all in post, and, as I guess,
CLARENCE:
To make a bloody supper in the Tower.
KING EDWARD IV:
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
KING EDWARD IV:
Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
KING EDWARD IV:
With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
KING EDWARD IV:
And see our gentle queen how well she fares
KING EDWARD IV:
By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt
KING EDWARD IV:
SCENE VI. London. The Tower.
KING EDWARD IV:
Enter KING HENRY VI and GLOUCESTER, with the Lieutenant, on the walls
GLOUCESTER:
Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather,
KING HENRY VI:
'Tis sin to flatter, 'good' was little better
KING HENRY VI:
'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
KING HENRY VI:
And both preposterous, therefore, not 'good lord.'
GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit Lieutenant
KING HENRY VI:
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf,
KING HENRY VI:
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
KING HENRY VI:
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
KING HENRY VI:
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
GLOUCESTER:
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind,
GLOUCESTER:
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
KING HENRY VI:
The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
KING HENRY VI:
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush,
KING HENRY VI:
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
KING HENRY VI:
Have now the fatal object in my eye
KING HENRY VI:
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
GLOUCESTER:
That taught his son the office of a fowl!
GLOUCESTER:
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.
KING HENRY VI:
I, Daedalus, my poor boy, Icarus,
KING HENRY VI:
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course,
KING HENRY VI:
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
KING HENRY VI:
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
KING HENRY VI:
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
KING HENRY VI:
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
KING HENRY VI:
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
KING HENRY VI:
Than can my ears that tragic history.
KING HENRY VI:
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
GLOUCESTER:
Think'st thou I am an executioner?
KING HENRY VI:
A persecutor, I am sure, thou art
KING HENRY VI:
If murdering innocents be executing,
KING HENRY VI:
Why, then thou art an executioner.
GLOUCESTER:
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
KING HENRY VI:
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
KING HENRY VI:
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
KING HENRY VI:
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
KING HENRY VI:
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
KING HENRY VI:
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
KING HENRY VI:
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
KING HENRY VI:
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
KING HENRY VI:
And orphans for their parents timeless death--
KING HENRY VI:
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
KING HENRY VI:
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign,
KING HENRY VI:
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time,
KING HENRY VI:
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees,
KING HENRY VI:
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
KING HENRY VI:
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
KING HENRY VI:
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
KING HENRY VI:
And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
KING HENRY VI:
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
KING HENRY VI:
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
KING HENRY VI:
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
KING HENRY VI:
To signify thou camest to bite the world
KING HENRY VI:
And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
KING HENRY VI:
Thou camest--
GLOUCESTER:
I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech
GLOUCESTER:
Stabs him
GLOUCESTER:
For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
KING HENRY VI:
God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!
KING HENRY VI:
Dies
GLOUCESTER:
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
GLOUCESTER:
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
GLOUCESTER:
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
GLOUCESTER:
O, may such purple tears be alway shed
GLOUCESTER:
From those that wish the downfall of our house!
GLOUCESTER:
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
GLOUCESTER:
Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee thither
GLOUCESTER:
Stabs him again
GLOUCESTER:
I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
GLOUCESTER:
Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of,
GLOUCESTER:
For I have often heard my mother say
GLOUCESTER:
I came into the world with my legs forward
GLOUCESTER:
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
GLOUCESTER:
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
GLOUCESTER:
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
GLOUCESTER:
'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
GLOUCESTER:
And so I was, which plainly signified
GLOUCESTER:
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
GLOUCESTER:
Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
GLOUCESTER:
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
GLOUCESTER:
I have no brother, I am like no brother,
GLOUCESTER:
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
GLOUCESTER:
Be resident in men like one another
GLOUCESTER:
And not in me: I am myself alone.
GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, beware, thou keep'st me from the light
GLOUCESTER:
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee,
GLOUCESTER:
For I will buz abroad such prophecies
GLOUCESTER:
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
GLOUCESTER:
And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
GLOUCESTER:
King Henry and the prince his son are gone
GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
GLOUCESTER:
Counting myself but bad till I be best.
GLOUCESTER:
I'll throw thy body in another room
GLOUCESTER:
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit, with the body
GLOUCESTER:
SCENE VII. London. The palace.
GLOUCESTER:
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, QUEEN ELIZABETH,  CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, a Nurse with the young Prince, and Attendants
KING EDWARD IV:
Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
KING EDWARD IV:
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
KING EDWARD IV:
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
KING EDWARD IV:
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
KING EDWARD IV:
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
KING EDWARD IV:
For hardy and undoubted champions,
KING EDWARD IV:
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
KING EDWARD IV:
And two Northumberlands, two braver men
KING EDWARD IV:
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound,
KING EDWARD IV:
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
KING EDWARD IV:
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
KING EDWARD IV:
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
KING EDWARD IV:
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
KING EDWARD IV:
And made our footstool of security.
KING EDWARD IV:
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
KING EDWARD IV:
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
KING EDWARD IV:
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
KING EDWARD IV:
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
KING EDWARD IV:
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace,
KING EDWARD IV:
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside]  I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid,
GLOUCESTER:
For yet I am not look'd on in the world.
GLOUCESTER:
This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave,
GLOUCESTER:
And heave it shall some weight, or break my back
GLOUCESTER:
Work thou the way,--and thou shalt execute.
KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen,
KING EDWARD IV:
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
CLARENCE:
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
CLARENCE:
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thanks, noble Clarence, worthy brother, thanks.
GLOUCESTER:
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
GLOUCESTER:
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.
GLOUCESTER:
Aside
GLOUCESTER:
And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.
KING EDWARD IV:
Now am I seated as my soul delights,
KING EDWARD IV:
Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.
CLARENCE:
What will your grace have done with Margaret?
CLARENCE:
Reignier, her father, to the king of France
CLARENCE:
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
CLARENCE:
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.
KING EDWARD IV:
Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
KING EDWARD IV:
And now what rests but that we spend the time
KING EDWARD IV:
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
KING EDWARD IV:
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
KING EDWARD IV:
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
KING EDWARD IV:
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.
KING EDWARD IV:
Exeunt
