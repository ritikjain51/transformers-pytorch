SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.
KING:
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
ORLANDO:
As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
ORLANDO:
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
ORLANDO:
and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
ORLANDO:
blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
ORLANDO:
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
ORLANDO:
report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
ORLANDO:
he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
ORLANDO:
properly, stays me here at home unkept, for call you
ORLANDO:
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
ORLANDO:
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
ORLANDO:
are bred better, for, besides that they are fair
ORLANDO:
with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
ORLANDO:
and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
ORLANDO:
brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the
ORLANDO:
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
ORLANDO:
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
ORLANDO:
plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
ORLANDO:
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
ORLANDO:
me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
ORLANDO:
brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
ORLANDO:
gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
ORLANDO:
grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I
ORLANDO:
think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
ORLANDO:
servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
ORLANDO:
know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
ADAM:
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
ORLANDO:
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
ORLANDO:
shake me up.
ORLANDO:
Enter OLIVER
OLIVER:
Now, sir! what make you here?
ORLANDO:
Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
OLIVER:
What mar you then, sir?
ORLANDO:
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
ORLANDO:
made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
OLIVER:
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
ORLANDO:
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
ORLANDO:
What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
ORLANDO:
come to such penury?
OLIVER:
Know you where your are, sir?
ORLANDO:
O, sir, very well, here in your orchard.
OLIVER:
Know you before whom, sir?
ORLANDO:
Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
ORLANDO:
you are my eldest brother, and, in the gentle
ORLANDO:
condition of blood, you should so know me. The
ORLANDO:
courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
ORLANDO:
you are the first-born, but the same tradition
ORLANDO:
takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
ORLANDO:
betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
ORLANDO:
you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
ORLANDO:
nearer to his reverence.
OLIVER:
What, boy!
ORLANDO:
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
OLIVER:
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
ORLANDO:
I am no villain, I am the youngest son of Sir
ORLANDO:
Rowland de Boys, he was my father, and he is thrice
ORLANDO:
a villain that says such a father begot villains.
ORLANDO:
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
ORLANDO:
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
ORLANDO:
tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
ADAM:
Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
ADAM:
remembrance, be at accord.
OLIVER:
Let me go, I say.
ORLANDO:
I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
ORLANDO:
father charged you in his will to give me good
ORLANDO:
education: you have trained me like a peasant,
ORLANDO:
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
ORLANDO:
qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
ORLANDO:
me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
ORLANDO:
me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
ORLANDO:
give me the poor allottery my father left me by
ORLANDO:
testament, with that I will go buy my fortunes.
OLIVER:
And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
OLIVER:
Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
OLIVER:
with you, you shall have some part of your will: I
OLIVER:
pray you, leave me.
ORLANDO:
I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
OLIVER:
Get you with him, you old dog.
ADAM:
Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
ADAM:
teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
ADAM:
he would not have spoke such a word.
ADAM:
Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
OLIVER:
Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
OLIVER:
physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
OLIVER:
crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!
OLIVER:
Enter DENNIS
DENNIS:
Calls your worship?
OLIVER:
Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
DENNIS:
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
DENNIS:
access to you.
OLIVER:
Call him in.
OLIVER:
Exit DENNIS
OLIVER:
'Twill be a good way, and to-morrow the wrestling is.
OLIVER:
Enter CHARLES
CHARLES:
Good morrow to your worship.
OLIVER:
Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
OLIVER:
new court?
CHARLES:
There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news
CHARLES:
that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
CHARLES:
brother the new duke, and three or four loving lords
CHARLES:
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
CHARLES:
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke,
CHARLES:
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
OLIVER:
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
OLIVER:
banished with her father?
CHARLES:
O, no, for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
CHARLES:
her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
CHARLES:
that she would have followed her exile, or have died
CHARLES:
to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
CHARLES:
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and
CHARLES:
never two ladies loved as they do.
OLIVER:
Where will the old duke live?
CHARLES:
They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
CHARLES:
a many merry men with him, and there they live like
CHARLES:
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
CHARLES:
gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
CHARLES:
carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
OLIVER:
What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
CHARLES:
Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a
CHARLES:
matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
CHARLES:
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
CHARLES:
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
CHARLES:
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that
CHARLES:
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
CHARLES:
well. Your brother is but young and tender, and,
CHARLES:
for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
CHARLES:
must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
CHARLES:
out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
CHARLES:
withal, that either you might stay him from his
CHARLES:
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
CHARLES:
run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
CHARLES:
and altogether against my will.
OLIVER:
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
OLIVER:
thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
OLIVER:
myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
OLIVER:
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
OLIVER:
it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles
OLIVER:
it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
OLIVER:
of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
OLIVER:
good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
OLIVER:
me his natural brother: therefore use thy
OLIVER:
discretion, I had as lief thou didst break his neck
OLIVER:
as his finger. And thou wert best look to't, for if
OLIVER:
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
OLIVER:
mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
OLIVER:
against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
OLIVER:
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
OLIVER:
hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other,
OLIVER:
for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
OLIVER:
it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
OLIVER:
day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but
OLIVER:
should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
OLIVER:
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
CHARLES:
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
CHARLES:
to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
CHARLES:
alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
CHARLES:
so God keep your worship!
OLIVER:
Farewell, good Charles.
OLIVER:
Exit CHARLES
OLIVER:
Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
OLIVER:
an end of him, for my soul, yet I know not why,
OLIVER:
hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
OLIVER:
schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
OLIVER:
all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
OLIVER:
in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
OLIVER:
people, who best know him, that I am altogether
OLIVER:
misprised: but it shall not be so long, this
OLIVER:
wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
OLIVER:
I kindle the boy thither, which now I'll go about.
OLIVER:
Exit
OLIVER:
SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.
OLIVER:
Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
CELIA:
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
ROSALIND:
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of,
ROSALIND:
and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
ROSALIND:
teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
ROSALIND:
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
CELIA:
Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
CELIA:
that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
CELIA:
had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
CELIA:
hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
CELIA:
love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
CELIA:
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
CELIA:
tempered as mine is to thee.
ROSALIND:
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
ROSALIND:
rejoice in yours.
CELIA:
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
CELIA:
like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
CELIA:
be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
CELIA:
father perforce, I will render thee again in
CELIA:
affection, by mine honour, I will, and when I break
CELIA:
that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
CELIA:
sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
ROSALIND:
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
ROSALIND:
me see, what think you of falling in love?
CELIA:
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
CELIA:
love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport
CELIA:
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
CELIA:
in honour come off again.
ROSALIND:
What shall be our sport, then?
CELIA:
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
CELIA:
her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
ROSALIND:
I would we could do so, for her benefits are
ROSALIND:
mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
ROSALIND:
doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
CELIA:
'Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce
CELIA:
makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
CELIA:
makes very ill-favouredly.
ROSALIND:
Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
ROSALIND:
Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
ROSALIND:
not in the lineaments of Nature.
ROSALIND:
Enter TOUCHSTONE
CELIA:
No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
CELIA:
not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
CELIA:
hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
CELIA:
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
ROSALIND:
Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
ROSALIND:
Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
ROSALIND:
Nature's wit.
CELIA:
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
CELIA:
Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
CELIA:
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
CELIA:
natural for our whetstone, for always the dulness of
CELIA:
the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
CELIA:
wit! whither wander you?
TOUCHSTONE:
Mistress, you must come away to your father.
CELIA:
Were you made the messenger?
TOUCHSTONE:
No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
ROSALIND:
Where learned you that oath, fool?
TOUCHSTONE:
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
TOUCHSTONE:
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
TOUCHSTONE:
mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
TOUCHSTONE:
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
TOUCHSTONE:
yet was not the knight forsworn.
CELIA:
How prove you that, in the great heap of your
CELIA:
knowledge?
ROSALIND:
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
TOUCHSTONE:
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
TOUCHSTONE:
swear by your beards that I am a knave.
CELIA:
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
TOUCHSTONE:
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were, but if you
TOUCHSTONE:
swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
TOUCHSTONE:
more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
TOUCHSTONE:
never had any, or if he had, he had sworn it away
TOUCHSTONE:
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
CELIA:
Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?
TOUCHSTONE:
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
CELIA:
My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
CELIA:
speak no more of him, you'll be whipped for taxation
CELIA:
one of these days.
TOUCHSTONE:
The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
TOUCHSTONE:
wise men do foolishly.
CELIA:
By my troth, thou sayest true, for since the little
CELIA:
wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
CELIA:
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
CELIA:
Monsieur Le Beau.
ROSALIND:
With his mouth full of news.
CELIA:
Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
ROSALIND:
Then shall we be news-crammed.
CELIA:
All the better, we shall be the more marketable.
CELIA:
Enter LE BEAU
CELIA:
Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?
LE BEAU:
Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
CELIA:
Sport! of what colour?
LE BEAU:
What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?
ROSALIND:
As wit and fortune will.
TOUCHSTONE:
Or as the Destinies decree.
CELIA:
Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
TOUCHSTONE:
Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
ROSALIND:
Thou losest thy old smell.
LE BEAU:
You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
LE BEAU:
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
ROSALIND:
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
LE BEAU:
I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please
LE BEAU:
your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is
LE BEAU:
yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming
LE BEAU:
to perform it.
CELIA:
Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
LE BEAU:
There comes an old man and his three sons,--
CELIA:
I could match this beginning with an old tale.
LE BEAU:
Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
ROSALIND:
With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
ROSALIND:
by these presents.'
LE BEAU:
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
LE BEAU:
duke's wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him
LE BEAU:
and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
LE BEAU:
hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
LE BEAU:
so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man,
LE BEAU:
their father, making such pitiful dole over them
LE BEAU:
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
ROSALIND:
Alas!
TOUCHSTONE:
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
TOUCHSTONE:
have lost?
LE BEAU:
Why, this that I speak of.
TOUCHSTONE:
Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
TOUCHSTONE:
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
TOUCHSTONE:
for ladies.
CELIA:
Or I, I promise thee.
ROSALIND:
But is there any else longs to see this broken music
ROSALIND:
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
ROSALIND:
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
LE BEAU:
You must, if you stay here, for here is the place
LE BEAU:
appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
LE BEAU:
perform it.
CELIA:
Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.
CELIA:
Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants
DUKE FREDERICK:
Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
DUKE FREDERICK:
own peril on his forwardness.
ROSALIND:
Is yonder the man?
LE BEAU:
Even he, madam.
CELIA:
Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.
DUKE FREDERICK:
How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
DUKE FREDERICK:
to see the wrestling?
ROSALIND:
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
DUKE FREDERICK:
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,
DUKE FREDERICK:
there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
DUKE FREDERICK:
challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
DUKE FREDERICK:
will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies, see if
DUKE FREDERICK:
you can move him.
CELIA:
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Do so: I'll not be by.
LE BEAU:
Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.
ORLANDO:
I attend them with all respect and duty.
ROSALIND:
Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
ORLANDO:
No, fair princess, he is the general challenger: I
ORLANDO:
come but in, as others do, to try with him the
ORLANDO:
strength of my youth.
CELIA:
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
CELIA:
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
CELIA:
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
CELIA:
knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
CELIA:
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
CELIA:
enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
CELIA:
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
ROSALIND:
Do, young sir, your reputation shall not therefore
ROSALIND:
be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
ROSALIND:
that the wrestling might not go forward.
ORLANDO:
I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
ORLANDO:
thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
ORLANDO:
so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
ORLANDO:
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
ORLANDO:
trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
ORLANDO:
shamed that was never gracious, if killed, but one
ORLANDO:
dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
ORLANDO:
friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
ORLANDO:
world no injury, for in it I have nothing, only in
ORLANDO:
the world I fill up a place, which may be better
ORLANDO:
supplied when I have made it empty.
ROSALIND:
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
CELIA:
And mine, to eke out hers.
ROSALIND:
Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
CELIA:
Your heart's desires be with you!
CHARLES:
Come, where is this young gallant that is so
CHARLES:
desirous to lie with his mother earth?
ORLANDO:
Ready, sir, but his will hath in it a more modest working.
DUKE FREDERICK:
You shall try but one fall.
CHARLES:
No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
CHARLES:
to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
CHARLES:
from a first.
ORLANDO:
An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
ORLANDO:
mocked me before: but come your ways.
ROSALIND:
Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!
CELIA:
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
CELIA:
fellow by the leg.
CELIA:
They wrestle
ROSALIND:
O excellent young man!
CELIA:
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
CELIA:
should down.
CELIA:
Shout. CHARLES is thrown
DUKE FREDERICK:
No more, no more.
ORLANDO:
Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.
DUKE FREDERICK:
How dost thou, Charles?
LE BEAU:
He cannot speak, my lord.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
ORLANDO:
Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
DUKE FREDERICK:
I would thou hadst been son to some man else
DUKE FREDERICK:
The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
DUKE FREDERICK:
But I did find him still mine enemy
DUKE FREDERICK:
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
DUKE FREDERICK:
Hadst thou descended from another house.
DUKE FREDERICK:
But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth
DUKE FREDERICK:
I would thou hadst told me of another father.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU
CELIA:
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
ORLANDO:
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
ORLANDO:
His youngest son, and would not change that calling,
ORLANDO:
To be adopted heir to Frederick.
ROSALIND:
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
ROSALIND:
And all the world was of my father's mind
ROSALIND:
Had I before known this young man his son,
ROSALIND:
I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
ROSALIND:
Ere he should thus have ventured.
CELIA:
Gentle cousin,
CELIA:
Let us go thank him and encourage him
CELIA:
My father's rough and envious disposition
CELIA:
Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved
CELIA:
If you do keep your promises in love
CELIA:
But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
CELIA:
Your mistress shall be happy.
ROSALIND:
Gentleman,
ROSALIND:
Giving him a chain from her neck
ROSALIND:
Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
ROSALIND:
That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
ROSALIND:
Shall we go, coz?
CELIA:
Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
ORLANDO:
Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
ORLANDO:
Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
ORLANDO:
Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
ROSALIND:
He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes,
ROSALIND:
I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
ROSALIND:
Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
ROSALIND:
More than your enemies.
CELIA:
Will you go, coz?
ROSALIND:
Have with you. Fare you well.
ROSALIND:
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
ORLANDO:
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
ORLANDO:
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
ORLANDO:
O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
ORLANDO:
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
ORLANDO:
Re-enter LE BEAU
LE BEAU:
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
LE BEAU:
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
LE BEAU:
High commendation, true applause and love,
LE BEAU:
Yet such is now the duke's condition
LE BEAU:
That he misconstrues all that you have done.
LE BEAU:
The duke is humorous, what he is indeed,
LE BEAU:
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
ORLANDO:
I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this
ORLANDO:
Which of the two was daughter of the duke
ORLANDO:
That here was at the wrestling?
LE BEAU:
Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,
LE BEAU:
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
LE BEAU:
The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
LE BEAU:
And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
LE BEAU:
To keep his daughter company, whose loves
LE BEAU:
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
LE BEAU:
But I can tell you that of late this duke
LE BEAU:
Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
LE BEAU:
Grounded upon no other argument
LE BEAU:
But that the people praise her for her virtues
LE BEAU:
And pity her for her good father's sake,
LE BEAU:
And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
LE BEAU:
Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well
LE BEAU:
Hereafter, in a better world than this,
LE BEAU:
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
ORLANDO:
I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
ORLANDO:
Exit LE BEAU
ORLANDO:
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother,
ORLANDO:
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
ORLANDO:
But heavenly Rosalind!
ORLANDO:
Exit
ORLANDO:
SCENE III. A room in the palace.
ORLANDO:
Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
CELIA:
Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?
ROSALIND:
Not one to throw at a dog.
CELIA:
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
CELIA:
curs, throw some of them at me, come, lame me with reasons.
ROSALIND:
Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one
ROSALIND:
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
ROSALIND:
without any.
CELIA:
But is all this for your father?
ROSALIND:
No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
ROSALIND:
full of briers is this working-day world!
CELIA:
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
CELIA:
holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
CELIA:
paths our very petticoats will catch them.
ROSALIND:
I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
CELIA:
Hem them away.
ROSALIND:
I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
CELIA:
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
ROSALIND:
O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!
CELIA:
O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
CELIA:
despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
CELIA:
service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
CELIA:
possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
CELIA:
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
ROSALIND:
The duke my father loved his father dearly.
CELIA:
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
CELIA:
dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
CELIA:
for my father hated his father dearly, yet I hate
CELIA:
not Orlando.
ROSALIND:
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
CELIA:
Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
ROSALIND:
Let me love him for that, and do you love him
ROSALIND:
because I do. Look, here comes the duke.
CELIA:
With his eyes full of anger.
CELIA:
Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords
DUKE FREDERICK:
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
DUKE FREDERICK:
And get you from our court.
ROSALIND:
Me, uncle?
DUKE FREDERICK:
You, cousin
DUKE FREDERICK:
Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
DUKE FREDERICK:
So near our public court as twenty miles,
DUKE FREDERICK:
Thou diest for it.
ROSALIND:
I do beseech your grace,
ROSALIND:
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
ROSALIND:
If with myself I hold intelligence
ROSALIND:
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
ROSALIND:
If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
ROSALIND:
As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
ROSALIND:
Never so much as in a thought unborn
ROSALIND:
Did I offend your highness.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Thus do all traitors
DUKE FREDERICK:
If their purgation did consist in words,
DUKE FREDERICK:
They are as innocent as grace itself
DUKE FREDERICK:
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
ROSALIND:
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
ROSALIND:
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Thou art thy father's daughter, there's enough.
ROSALIND:
So was I when your highness took his dukedom,
ROSALIND:
So was I when your highness banish'd him
ROSALIND:
Treason is not inherited, my lord,
ROSALIND:
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
ROSALIND:
What's that to me? my father was no traitor
ROSALIND:
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
ROSALIND:
To think my poverty is treacherous.
CELIA:
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Ay, Celia, we stay'd her for your sake,
DUKE FREDERICK:
Else had she with her father ranged along.
CELIA:
I did not then entreat to have her stay,
CELIA:
It was your pleasure and your own remorse
CELIA:
I was too young that time to value her,
CELIA:
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
CELIA:
Why so am I, we still have slept together,
CELIA:
Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
CELIA:
And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
CELIA:
Still we went coupled and inseparable.
DUKE FREDERICK:
She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness,
DUKE FREDERICK:
Her very silence and her patience
DUKE FREDERICK:
Speak to the people, and they pity her.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name,
DUKE FREDERICK:
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
DUKE FREDERICK:
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips
DUKE FREDERICK:
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
DUKE FREDERICK:
Which I have pass'd upon her, she is banish'd.
CELIA:
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege
CELIA:
I cannot live out of her company.
DUKE FREDERICK:
You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself
DUKE FREDERICK:
If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
DUKE FREDERICK:
And in the greatness of my word, you die.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords
CELIA:
O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
CELIA:
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
CELIA:
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
ROSALIND:
I have more cause.
CELIA:
Thou hast not, cousin,
CELIA:
Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
CELIA:
Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
ROSALIND:
That he hath not.
CELIA:
No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
CELIA:
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one
CELIA:
Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
CELIA:
No: let my father seek another heir.
CELIA:
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
CELIA:
Whither to go and what to bear with us,
CELIA:
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
CELIA:
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out,
CELIA:
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
CELIA:
Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
ROSALIND:
Why, whither shall we go?
CELIA:
To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
ROSALIND:
Alas, what danger will it be to us,
ROSALIND:
Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
ROSALIND:
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
CELIA:
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
CELIA:
And with a kind of umber smirch my face,
CELIA:
The like do you: so shall we pass along
CELIA:
And never stir assailants.
ROSALIND:
Were it not better,
ROSALIND:
Because that I am more than common tall,
ROSALIND:
That I did suit me all points like a man?
ROSALIND:
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
ROSALIND:
A boar-spear in my hand, and--in my heart
ROSALIND:
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
ROSALIND:
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
ROSALIND:
As many other mannish cowards have
ROSALIND:
That do outface it with their semblances.
CELIA:
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
ROSALIND:
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
ROSALIND:
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
ROSALIND:
But what will you be call'd?
CELIA:
Something that hath a reference to my state
CELIA:
No longer Celia, but Aliena.
ROSALIND:
But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
ROSALIND:
The clownish fool out of your father's court?
ROSALIND:
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
CELIA:
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me,
CELIA:
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
CELIA:
And get our jewels and our wealth together,
CELIA:
Devise the fittest time and safest way
CELIA:
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
CELIA:
After my flight. Now go we in content
CELIA:
To liberty and not to banishment.
CELIA:
Exeunt
CELIA:
ACT II
CELIA:
SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.
CELIA:
Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords, like foresters
DUKE SENIOR:
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
DUKE SENIOR:
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
DUKE SENIOR:
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
DUKE SENIOR:
More free from peril than the envious court?
DUKE SENIOR:
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
DUKE SENIOR:
The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
DUKE SENIOR:
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
DUKE SENIOR:
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
DUKE SENIOR:
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
DUKE SENIOR:
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
DUKE SENIOR:
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
DUKE SENIOR:
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
DUKE SENIOR:
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
DUKE SENIOR:
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head,
DUKE SENIOR:
And this our life exempt from public haunt
DUKE SENIOR:
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
DUKE SENIOR:
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
DUKE SENIOR:
I would not change it.
AMIENS:
Happy is your grace,
AMIENS:
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
AMIENS:
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
DUKE SENIOR:
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
DUKE SENIOR:
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
DUKE SENIOR:
Being native burghers of this desert city,
DUKE SENIOR:
Should in their own confines with forked heads
DUKE SENIOR:
Have their round haunches gored.
First Lord:
Indeed, my lord,
First Lord:
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
First Lord:
And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
First Lord:
Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
First Lord:
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
First Lord:
Did steal behind him as he lay along
First Lord:
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
First Lord:
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood
First Lord:
To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
First Lord:
That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
First Lord:
Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
First Lord:
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
First Lord:
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
First Lord:
Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
First Lord:
Coursed one another down his innocent nose
First Lord:
In piteous chase, and thus the hairy fool
First Lord:
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
First Lord:
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
First Lord:
Augmenting it with tears.
DUKE SENIOR:
But what said Jaques?
DUKE SENIOR:
Did he not moralize this spectacle?
First Lord:
O, yes, into a thousand similes.
First Lord:
First, for his weeping into the needless stream,
First Lord:
'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
First Lord:
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
First Lord:
To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
First Lord:
Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
First Lord:
''Tis right:' quoth he, 'thus misery doth part
First Lord:
The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
First Lord:
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
First Lord:
And never stays to greet him, 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
First Lord:
'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens,
First Lord:
'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
First Lord:
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
First Lord:
Thus most invectively he pierceth through
First Lord:
The body of the country, city, court,
First Lord:
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
First Lord:
Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
First Lord:
To fright the animals and to kill them up
First Lord:
In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
DUKE SENIOR:
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
Second Lord:
We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
Second Lord:
Upon the sobbing deer.
DUKE SENIOR:
Show me the place
DUKE SENIOR:
I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
DUKE SENIOR:
For then he's full of matter.
First Lord:
I'll bring you to him straight.
First Lord:
Exeunt
First Lord:
SCENE II. A room in the palace.
First Lord:
Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords
DUKE FREDERICK:
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
DUKE FREDERICK:
It cannot be: some villains of my court
DUKE FREDERICK:
Are of consent and sufferance in this.
First Lord:
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
First Lord:
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
First Lord:
Saw her abed, and in the morning early
First Lord:
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
Second Lord:
My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
Second Lord:
Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
Second Lord:
Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
Second Lord:
Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
Second Lord:
Your daughter and her cousin much commend
Second Lord:
The parts and graces of the wrestler
Second Lord:
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles,
Second Lord:
And she believes, wherever they are gone,
Second Lord:
That youth is surely in their company.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Send to his brother, fetch that gallant hither,
DUKE FREDERICK:
If he be absent, bring his brother to me,
DUKE FREDERICK:
I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
DUKE FREDERICK:
And let not search and inquisition quail
DUKE FREDERICK:
To bring again these foolish runaways.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Exeunt
DUKE FREDERICK:
SCENE III. Before OLIVER'S house.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting
ORLANDO:
Who's there?
ADAM:
What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
ADAM:
O my sweet master! O you memory
ADAM:
Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
ADAM:
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
ADAM:
And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
ADAM:
Why would you be so fond to overcome
ADAM:
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
ADAM:
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
ADAM:
Know you not, master, to some kind of men
ADAM:
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
ADAM:
No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
ADAM:
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
ADAM:
O, what a world is this, when what is comely
ADAM:
Envenoms him that bears it!
ORLANDO:
Why, what's the matter?
ADAM:
O unhappy youth!
ADAM:
Come not within these doors, within this roof
ADAM:
The enemy of all your graces lives
ADAM:
Your brother--no, no brother, yet the son--
ADAM:
Yet not the son, I will not call him son
ADAM:
Of him I was about to call his father--
ADAM:
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
ADAM:
To burn the lodging where you use to lie
ADAM:
And you within it: if he fail of that,
ADAM:
He will have other means to cut you off.
ADAM:
I overheard him and his practises.
ADAM:
This is no place, this house is but a butchery
ADAM:
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
ORLANDO:
Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
ADAM:
No matter whither, so you come not here.
ORLANDO:
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
ORLANDO:
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
ORLANDO:
A thievish living on the common road?
ORLANDO:
This I must do, or know not what to do
ORLANDO:
Yet this I will not do, do how I can,
ORLANDO:
I rather will subject me to the malice
ORLANDO:
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
ADAM:
But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
ADAM:
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
ADAM:
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
ADAM:
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
ADAM:
And unregarded age in corners thrown
ADAM:
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
ADAM:
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
ADAM:
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold,
ADAM:
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant
ADAM:
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,
ADAM:
For in my youth I never did apply
ADAM:
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
ADAM:
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
ADAM:
The means of weakness and debility,
ADAM:
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
ADAM:
Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you,
ADAM:
I'll do the service of a younger man
ADAM:
In all your business and necessities.
ORLANDO:
O good old man, how well in thee appears
ORLANDO:
The constant service of the antique world,
ORLANDO:
When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
ORLANDO:
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
ORLANDO:
Where none will sweat but for promotion,
ORLANDO:
And having that, do choke their service up
ORLANDO:
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
ORLANDO:
But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
ORLANDO:
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
ORLANDO:
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
ORLANDO:
But come thy ways, well go along together,
ORLANDO:
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
ORLANDO:
We'll light upon some settled low content.
ADAM:
Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
ADAM:
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
ADAM:
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
ADAM:
Here lived I, but now live here no more.
ADAM:
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
ADAM:
But at fourscore it is too late a week
ADAM:
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
ADAM:
Than to die well and not my master's debtor.
ADAM:
Exeunt
ADAM:
SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden.
ADAM:
Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena, and TOUCHSTONE
ROSALIND:
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
TOUCHSTONE:
I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
ROSALIND:
I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
ROSALIND:
apparel and to cry like a woman, but I must comfort
ROSALIND:
the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show
ROSALIND:
itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,
ROSALIND:
good Aliena!
CELIA:
I pray you, bear with me, I cannot go no further.
TOUCHSTONE:
For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear
TOUCHSTONE:
you, yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,
TOUCHSTONE:
for I think you have no money in your purse.
ROSALIND:
Well, this is the forest of Arden.
TOUCHSTONE:
Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I, when I was
TOUCHSTONE:
at home, I was in a better place: but travellers
TOUCHSTONE:
must be content.
ROSALIND:
Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
ROSALIND:
Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
ROSALIND:
Look you, who comes here, a young man and an old in
ROSALIND:
solemn talk.
CORIN:
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
SILVIUS:
O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
CORIN:
I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.
SILVIUS:
No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
SILVIUS:
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
SILVIUS:
As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow
SILVIUS:
But if thy love were ever like to mine--
SILVIUS:
As sure I think did never man love so--
SILVIUS:
How many actions most ridiculous
SILVIUS:
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
CORIN:
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
SILVIUS:
O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!
SILVIUS:
If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
SILVIUS:
That ever love did make thee run into,
SILVIUS:
Thou hast not loved
SILVIUS:
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
SILVIUS:
Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
SILVIUS:
Thou hast not loved
SILVIUS:
Or if thou hast not broke from company
SILVIUS:
Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
SILVIUS:
Thou hast not loved.
SILVIUS:
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!
SILVIUS:
Exit
ROSALIND:
Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
ROSALIND:
I have by hard adventure found mine own.
TOUCHSTONE:
And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke
TOUCHSTONE:
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
TOUCHSTONE:
coming a-night to Jane Smile, and I remember the
TOUCHSTONE:
kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
TOUCHSTONE:
pretty chopt hands had milked, and I remember the
TOUCHSTONE:
wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took
TOUCHSTONE:
two cods and, giving her them again, said with
TOUCHSTONE:
weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
TOUCHSTONE:
true lovers run into strange capers, but as all is
TOUCHSTONE:
mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
ROSALIND:
Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
TOUCHSTONE:
Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I
TOUCHSTONE:
break my shins against it.
ROSALIND:
Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
ROSALIND:
Is much upon my fashion.
TOUCHSTONE:
And mine, but it grows something stale with me.
CELIA:
I pray you, one of you question yond man
CELIA:
If he for gold will give us any food
CELIA:
I faint almost to death.
TOUCHSTONE:
Holla, you clown!
ROSALIND:
Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.
CORIN:
Who calls?
TOUCHSTONE:
Your betters, sir.
CORIN:
Else are they very wretched.
ROSALIND:
Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
CORIN:
And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
ROSALIND:
I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
ROSALIND:
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
ROSALIND:
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
ROSALIND:
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
ROSALIND:
And faints for succor.
CORIN:
Fair sir, I pity her
CORIN:
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
CORIN:
My fortunes were more able to relieve her,
CORIN:
But I am shepherd to another man
CORIN:
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
CORIN:
My master is of churlish disposition
CORIN:
And little recks to find the way to heaven
CORIN:
By doing deeds of hospitality
CORIN:
Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
CORIN:
Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
CORIN:
By reason of his absence, there is nothing
CORIN:
That you will feed on, but what is, come see.
CORIN:
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
ROSALIND:
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
CORIN:
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
CORIN:
That little cares for buying any thing.
ROSALIND:
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
ROSALIND:
Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
ROSALIND:
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
CELIA:
And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
CELIA:
And willingly could waste my time in it.
CORIN:
Assuredly the thing is to be sold
CORIN:
Go with me: if you like upon report
CORIN:
The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
CORIN:
I will your very faithful feeder be
CORIN:
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
CORIN:
Exeunt
CORIN:
SCENE V. The Forest.
CORIN:
Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others
CORIN:
SONG.
AMIENS:
Under the greenwood tree
AMIENS:
Who loves to lie with me,
AMIENS:
And turn his merry note
AMIENS:
Unto the sweet bird's throat,
AMIENS:
Come hither, come hither, come hither
AMIENS:
Here shall he see No enemy
AMIENS:
But winter and rough weather.
JAQUES:
More, more, I prithee, more.
AMIENS:
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
JAQUES:
I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
JAQUES:
melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
JAQUES:
More, I prithee, more.
AMIENS:
My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.
JAQUES:
I do not desire you to please me, I do desire you to
JAQUES:
sing. Come, more, another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?
AMIENS:
What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
JAQUES:
Nay, I care not for their names, they owe me
JAQUES:
nothing. Will you sing?
AMIENS:
More at your request than to please myself.
JAQUES:
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you,
JAQUES:
but that they call compliment is like the encounter
JAQUES:
of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
JAQUES:
methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
JAQUES:
the beggarly thanks. Come, sing, and you that will
JAQUES:
not, hold your tongues.
AMIENS:
Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while, the
AMIENS:
duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
AMIENS:
this day to look you.
JAQUES:
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
JAQUES:
too disputable for my company: I think of as many
JAQUES:
matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
JAQUES:
boast of them. Come, warble, come.
JAQUES:
SONG.
JAQUES:
Who doth ambition shun
JAQUES:
All together here
JAQUES:
And loves to live i' the sun,
JAQUES:
Seeking the food he eats
JAQUES:
And pleased with what he gets,
JAQUES:
Come hither, come hither, come hither
JAQUES:
Here shall he see No enemy
JAQUES:
But winter and rough weather.
JAQUES:
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
JAQUES:
yesterday in despite of my invention.
AMIENS:
And I'll sing it.
JAQUES:
Thus it goes:--
JAQUES:
If it do come to pass
JAQUES:
That any man turn ass,
JAQUES:
Leaving his wealth and ease,
JAQUES:
A stubborn will to please,
JAQUES:
Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame
JAQUES:
Here shall he see
JAQUES:
Gross fools as he,
JAQUES:
An if he will come to me.
AMIENS:
What's that 'ducdame'?
JAQUES:
'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
JAQUES:
circle. I'll go sleep, if I can, if I cannot, I'll
JAQUES:
rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
AMIENS:
And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.
AMIENS:
Exeunt severally
AMIENS:
SCENE VI. The forest.
AMIENS:
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
ADAM:
Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
ADAM:
Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
ADAM:
kind master.
ORLANDO:
Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
ORLANDO:
a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little.
ORLANDO:
If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
ORLANDO:
will either be food for it or bring it for food to
ORLANDO:
thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
ORLANDO:
For my sake be comfortable, hold death awhile at
ORLANDO:
the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently,
ORLANDO:
and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
ORLANDO:
give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
ORLANDO:
come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
ORLANDO:
thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.
ORLANDO:
Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
ORLANDO:
thee to some shelter, and thou shalt not die for
ORLANDO:
lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this
ORLANDO:
desert. Cheerly, good Adam!
ORLANDO:
Exeunt
ORLANDO:
SCENE VII. The forest.
ORLANDO:
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlaws
DUKE SENIOR:
I think he be transform'd into a beast,
DUKE SENIOR:
For I can no where find him like a man.
First Lord:
My lord, he is but even now gone hence
First Lord:
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
DUKE SENIOR:
If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
DUKE SENIOR:
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
DUKE SENIOR:
Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.
DUKE SENIOR:
Enter JAQUES
First Lord:
He saves my labour by his own approach.
DUKE SENIOR:
Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
DUKE SENIOR:
That your poor friends must woo your company?
DUKE SENIOR:
What, you look merrily!
JAQUES:
A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
JAQUES:
A motley fool, a miserable world!
JAQUES:
As I do live by food, I met a fool
JAQUES:
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
JAQUES:
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
JAQUES:
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
JAQUES:
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
JAQUES:
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
JAQUES:
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
JAQUES:
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
JAQUES:
Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock
JAQUES:
Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags
JAQUES:
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
JAQUES:
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven,
JAQUES:
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
JAQUES:
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot,
JAQUES:
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
JAQUES:
The motley fool thus moral on the time,
JAQUES:
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
JAQUES:
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
JAQUES:
And I did laugh sans intermission
JAQUES:
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
JAQUES:
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
DUKE SENIOR:
What fool is this?
JAQUES:
O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
JAQUES:
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
JAQUES:
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
JAQUES:
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
JAQUES:
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
JAQUES:
With observation, the which he vents
JAQUES:
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
JAQUES:
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
DUKE SENIOR:
Thou shalt have one.
JAQUES:
It is my only suit,
JAQUES:
Provided that you weed your better judgments
JAQUES:
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
JAQUES:
That I am wise. I must have liberty
JAQUES:
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
JAQUES:
To blow on whom I please, for so fools have,
JAQUES:
And they that are most galled with my folly,
JAQUES:
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
JAQUES:
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church
JAQUES:
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
JAQUES:
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
JAQUES:
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
JAQUES:
The wise man's folly is anatomized
JAQUES:
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
JAQUES:
Invest me in my motley, give me leave
JAQUES:
To speak my mind, and I will through and through
JAQUES:
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
JAQUES:
If they will patiently receive my medicine.
DUKE SENIOR:
Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
JAQUES:
What, for a counter, would I do but good?
DUKE SENIOR:
Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin
DUKE SENIOR:
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
DUKE SENIOR:
As sensual as the brutish sting itself,
DUKE SENIOR:
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
DUKE SENIOR:
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
DUKE SENIOR:
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
JAQUES:
Why, who cries out on pride,
JAQUES:
That can therein tax any private party?
JAQUES:
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
JAQUES:
Till that the weary very means do ebb?
JAQUES:
What woman in the city do I name,
JAQUES:
When that I say the city-woman bears
JAQUES:
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
JAQUES:
Who can come in and say that I mean her,
JAQUES:
When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
JAQUES:
Or what is he of basest function
JAQUES:
That says his bravery is not of my cost,
JAQUES:
Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
JAQUES:
His folly to the mettle of my speech?
JAQUES:
There then, how then? what then? Let me see wherein
JAQUES:
My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
JAQUES:
Then he hath wrong'd himself, if he be free,
JAQUES:
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
JAQUES:
Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
JAQUES:
Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn
ORLANDO:
Forbear, and eat no more.
JAQUES:
Why, I have eat none yet.
ORLANDO:
Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.
JAQUES:
Of what kind should this cock come of?
DUKE SENIOR:
Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
DUKE SENIOR:
Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
DUKE SENIOR:
That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
ORLANDO:
You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
ORLANDO:
Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
ORLANDO:
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
ORLANDO:
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say
ORLANDO:
He dies that touches any of this fruit
ORLANDO:
Till I and my affairs are answered.
JAQUES:
An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
DUKE SENIOR:
What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
DUKE SENIOR:
More than your force move us to gentleness.
ORLANDO:
I almost die for food, and let me have it.
DUKE SENIOR:
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
ORLANDO:
Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you
ORLANDO:
I thought that all things had been savage here,
ORLANDO:
And therefore put I on the countenance
ORLANDO:
Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
ORLANDO:
That in this desert inaccessible,
ORLANDO:
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
ORLANDO:
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
ORLANDO:
If ever you have look'd on better days,
ORLANDO:
If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
ORLANDO:
If ever sat at any good man's feast,
ORLANDO:
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
ORLANDO:
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
ORLANDO:
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be
ORLANDO:
In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
DUKE SENIOR:
True is it that we have seen better days,
DUKE SENIOR:
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
DUKE SENIOR:
And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
DUKE SENIOR:
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd
DUKE SENIOR:
And therefore sit you down in gentleness
DUKE SENIOR:
And take upon command what help we have
DUKE SENIOR:
That to your wanting may be minister'd.
ORLANDO:
Then but forbear your food a little while,
ORLANDO:
Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
ORLANDO:
And give it food. There is an old poor man,
ORLANDO:
Who after me hath many a weary step
ORLANDO:
Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
ORLANDO:
Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
ORLANDO:
I will not touch a bit.
DUKE SENIOR:
Go find him out,
DUKE SENIOR:
And we will nothing waste till you return.
ORLANDO:
I thank ye, and be blest for your good comfort!
ORLANDO:
Exit
DUKE SENIOR:
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
DUKE SENIOR:
This wide and universal theatre
DUKE SENIOR:
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
DUKE SENIOR:
Wherein we play in.
JAQUES:
All the world's a stage,
JAQUES:
And all the men and women merely players
JAQUES:
They have their exits and their entrances,
JAQUES:
And one man in his time plays many parts,
JAQUES:
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
JAQUES:
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
JAQUES:
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
JAQUES:
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
JAQUES:
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
JAQUES:
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
JAQUES:
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
JAQUES:
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
JAQUES:
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
JAQUES:
Seeking the bubble reputation
JAQUES:
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
JAQUES:
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
JAQUES:
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
JAQUES:
Full of wise saws and modern instances,
JAQUES:
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
JAQUES:
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
JAQUES:
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
JAQUES:
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
JAQUES:
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
JAQUES:
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
JAQUES:
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
JAQUES:
That ends this strange eventful history,
JAQUES:
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
JAQUES:
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
JAQUES:
Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM
DUKE SENIOR:
Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
DUKE SENIOR:
And let him feed.
ORLANDO:
I thank you most for him.
ADAM:
So had you need
ADAM:
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
DUKE SENIOR:
Welcome, fall to: I will not trouble you
DUKE SENIOR:
As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
DUKE SENIOR:
Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.
DUKE SENIOR:
SONG.
AMIENS:
Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
AMIENS:
Thou art not so unkind
AMIENS:
As man's ingratitude,
AMIENS:
Thy tooth is not so keen,
AMIENS:
Because thou art not seen,
AMIENS:
Although thy breath be rude.
AMIENS:
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly
AMIENS:
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly
AMIENS:
Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
AMIENS:
This life is most jolly.
AMIENS:
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
AMIENS:
That dost not bite so nigh
AMIENS:
As benefits forgot
AMIENS:
Though thou the waters warp,
AMIENS:
Thy sting is not so sharp
AMIENS:
As friend remember'd not.
AMIENS:
Heigh-ho! sing,  and c.
DUKE SENIOR:
If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
DUKE SENIOR:
As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
DUKE SENIOR:
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
DUKE SENIOR:
Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
DUKE SENIOR:
Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
DUKE SENIOR:
That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
DUKE SENIOR:
Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
DUKE SENIOR:
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
DUKE SENIOR:
Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
DUKE SENIOR:
And let me all your fortunes understand.
DUKE SENIOR:
Exeunt
DUKE SENIOR:
ACT III
DUKE SENIOR:
SCENE I. A room in the palace.
DUKE SENIOR:
Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER
DUKE FREDERICK:
Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be
DUKE FREDERICK:
But were I not the better part made mercy,
DUKE FREDERICK:
I should not seek an absent argument
DUKE FREDERICK:
Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it
DUKE FREDERICK:
Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is,
DUKE FREDERICK:
Seek him with candle, bring him dead or living
DUKE FREDERICK:
Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
DUKE FREDERICK:
To seek a living in our territory.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
DUKE FREDERICK:
Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
DUKE FREDERICK:
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
DUKE FREDERICK:
Of what we think against thee.
OLIVER:
O that your highness knew my heart in this!
OLIVER:
I never loved my brother in my life.
DUKE FREDERICK:
More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors,
DUKE FREDERICK:
And let my officers of such a nature
DUKE FREDERICK:
Make an extent upon his house and lands
DUKE FREDERICK:
Do this expediently and turn him going.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Exeunt
DUKE FREDERICK:
SCENE II. The forest.
DUKE FREDERICK:
Enter ORLANDO, with a paper
ORLANDO:
Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love
ORLANDO:
And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
ORLANDO:
With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
ORLANDO:
Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
ORLANDO:
O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
ORLANDO:
And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
ORLANDO:
That every eye which in this forest looks
ORLANDO:
Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
ORLANDO:
Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree
ORLANDO:
The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.
ORLANDO:
Exit
ORLANDO:
Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
CORIN:
And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
TOUCHSTONE:
Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
TOUCHSTONE:
life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
TOUCHSTONE:
it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
TOUCHSTONE:
like it very well, but in respect that it is
TOUCHSTONE:
private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
TOUCHSTONE:
is in the fields, it pleaseth me well, but in
TOUCHSTONE:
respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
TOUCHSTONE:
is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well,
TOUCHSTONE:
but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
TOUCHSTONE:
against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
CORIN:
No more but that I know the more one sickens the
CORIN:
worse at ease he is, and that he that wants money,
CORIN:
means and content is without three good friends,
CORIN:
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
CORIN:
burn, that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
CORIN:
great cause of the night is lack of the sun, that
CORIN:
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
CORIN:
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
TOUCHSTONE:
Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
TOUCHSTONE:
court, shepherd?
CORIN:
No, truly.
TOUCHSTONE:
Then thou art damned.
CORIN:
Nay, I hope.
TOUCHSTONE:
Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all
TOUCHSTONE:
on one side.
CORIN:
For not being at court? Your reason.
TOUCHSTONE:
Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
TOUCHSTONE:
good manners, if thou never sawest good manners,
TOUCHSTONE:
then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is
TOUCHSTONE:
sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
TOUCHSTONE:
state, shepherd.
CORIN:
Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
CORIN:
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
CORIN:
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
CORIN:
court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
CORIN:
you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
CORIN:
uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.
TOUCHSTONE:
Instance, briefly, come, instance.
CORIN:
Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
CORIN:
fells, you know, are greasy.
TOUCHSTONE:
Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
TOUCHSTONE:
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
TOUCHSTONE:
a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say, come.
CORIN:
Besides, our hands are hard.
TOUCHSTONE:
Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
TOUCHSTONE:
A more sounder instance, come.
CORIN:
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
CORIN:
our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
CORIN:
courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
TOUCHSTONE:
Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
TOUCHSTONE:
good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
TOUCHSTONE:
perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
TOUCHSTONE:
very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
CORIN:
You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
TOUCHSTONE:
Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
TOUCHSTONE:
God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
CORIN:
Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
CORIN:
that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
CORIN:
happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
CORIN:
harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
CORIN:
graze and my lambs suck.
TOUCHSTONE:
That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
TOUCHSTONE:
and the rams together and to offer to get your
TOUCHSTONE:
living by the copulation of cattle, to be bawd to a
TOUCHSTONE:
bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
TOUCHSTONE:
twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
TOUCHSTONE:
out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
TOUCHSTONE:
damned for this, the devil himself will have no
TOUCHSTONE:
shepherds, I cannot see else how thou shouldst
TOUCHSTONE:
'scape.
CORIN:
Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.
CORIN:
Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading
ROSALIND:
From the east to western Ind,
ROSALIND:
No jewel is like Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
ROSALIND:
Through all the world bears Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
All the pictures fairest lined
ROSALIND:
Are but black to Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
Let no fair be kept in mind
ROSALIND:
But the fair of Rosalind.
TOUCHSTONE:
I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and
TOUCHSTONE:
suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
TOUCHSTONE:
right butter-women's rank to market.
ROSALIND:
Out, fool!
TOUCHSTONE:
For a taste
TOUCHSTONE:
If a hart do lack a hind,
TOUCHSTONE:
Let him seek out Rosalind.
TOUCHSTONE:
If the cat will after kind,
TOUCHSTONE:
So be sure will Rosalind.
TOUCHSTONE:
Winter garments must be lined,
TOUCHSTONE:
So must slender Rosalind.
TOUCHSTONE:
They that reap must sheaf and bind,
TOUCHSTONE:
Then to cart with Rosalind.
TOUCHSTONE:
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
TOUCHSTONE:
Such a nut is Rosalind.
TOUCHSTONE:
He that sweetest rose will find
TOUCHSTONE:
Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
TOUCHSTONE:
This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
TOUCHSTONE:
infect yourself with them?
ROSALIND:
Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
TOUCHSTONE:
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
ROSALIND:
I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
ROSALIND:
with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
ROSALIND:
i' the country, for you'll be rotten ere you be half
ROSALIND:
ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.
TOUCHSTONE:
You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the
TOUCHSTONE:
forest judge.
TOUCHSTONE:
Enter CELIA, with a writing
ROSALIND:
Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.
CELIA:
[Reads]
CELIA:
Why should this a desert be?
CELIA:
For it is unpeopled? No
CELIA:
Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
CELIA:
That shall civil sayings show
CELIA:
Some, how brief the life of man
CELIA:
Runs his erring pilgrimage,
CELIA:
That the stretching of a span
CELIA:
Buckles in his sum of age,
CELIA:
Some, of violated vows
CELIA:
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend
CELIA:
But upon the fairest boughs,
CELIA:
Or at every sentence end,
CELIA:
Will I Rosalinda write,
CELIA:
Teaching all that read to know
CELIA:
The quintessence of every sprite
CELIA:
Heaven would in little show.
CELIA:
Therefore Heaven Nature charged
CELIA:
That one body should be fill'd
CELIA:
With all graces wide-enlarged
CELIA:
Nature presently distill'd
CELIA:
Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
CELIA:
Cleopatra's majesty,
CELIA:
Atalanta's better part,
CELIA:
Sad Lucretia's modesty.
CELIA:
Thus Rosalind of many parts
CELIA:
By heavenly synod was devised,
CELIA:
Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
CELIA:
To have the touches dearest prized.
CELIA:
Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
CELIA:
And I to live and die her slave.
ROSALIND:
O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love
ROSALIND:
have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never
ROSALIND:
cried 'Have patience, good people!'
CELIA:
How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.
CELIA:
Go with him, sirrah.
TOUCHSTONE:
Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat,
TOUCHSTONE:
though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
TOUCHSTONE:
Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
CELIA:
Didst thou hear these verses?
ROSALIND:
O, yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of
ROSALIND:
them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
CELIA:
That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
ROSALIND:
Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
ROSALIND:
themselves without the verse and therefore stood
ROSALIND:
lamely in the verse.
CELIA:
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
CELIA:
should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
ROSALIND:
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
ROSALIND:
before you came, for look here what I found on a
ROSALIND:
palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
ROSALIND:
Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
ROSALIND:
can hardly remember.
CELIA:
Trow you who hath done this?
ROSALIND:
Is it a man?
CELIA:
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
CELIA:
Change you colour?
ROSALIND:
I prithee, who?
CELIA:
O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to
CELIA:
meet, but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
CELIA:
and so encounter.
ROSALIND:
Nay, but who is it?
CELIA:
Is it possible?
ROSALIND:
Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,
ROSALIND:
tell me who it is.
CELIA:
O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
CELIA:
wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
CELIA:
out of all hooping!
ROSALIND:
Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
ROSALIND:
caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
ROSALIND:
my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
ROSALIND:
South-sea of discovery, I prithee, tell me who is it
ROSALIND:
quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
ROSALIND:
stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
ROSALIND:
out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
ROSALIND:
mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
ROSALIND:
all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
ROSALIND:
may drink thy tidings.
CELIA:
So you may put a man in your belly.
ROSALIND:
Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
ROSALIND:
head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?
CELIA:
Nay, he hath but a little beard.
ROSALIND:
Why, God will send more, if the man will be
ROSALIND:
thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
ROSALIND:
thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
CELIA:
It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
CELIA:
heels and your heart both in an instant.
ROSALIND:
Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and
ROSALIND:
true maid.
CELIA:
I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
ROSALIND:
Orlando?
CELIA:
Orlando.
ROSALIND:
Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
ROSALIND:
hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
ROSALIND:
he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
ROSALIND:
him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
ROSALIND:
How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
ROSALIND:
him again? Answer me in one word.
CELIA:
You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
CELIA:
word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
CELIA:
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
CELIA:
answer in a catechism.
ROSALIND:
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
ROSALIND:
man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
ROSALIND:
day he wrestled?
CELIA:
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
CELIA:
propositions of a lover, but take a taste of my
CELIA:
finding him, and relish it with good observance.
CELIA:
I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
ROSALIND:
It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops
ROSALIND:
forth such fruit.
CELIA:
Give me audience, good madam.
ROSALIND:
Proceed.
CELIA:
There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.
ROSALIND:
Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
ROSALIND:
becomes the ground.
CELIA:
Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee, it curvets
CELIA:
unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
ROSALIND:
O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
CELIA:
I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
CELIA:
me out of tune.
ROSALIND:
Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must
ROSALIND:
speak. Sweet, say on.
CELIA:
You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
CELIA:
Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
ROSALIND:
'Tis he: slink by, and note him.
JAQUES:
I thank you for your company, but, good faith, I had
JAQUES:
as lief have been myself alone.
ORLANDO:
And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
ORLANDO:
too for your society.
JAQUES:
God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
ORLANDO:
I do desire we may be better strangers.
JAQUES:
I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
JAQUES:
love-songs in their barks.
ORLANDO:
I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
ORLANDO:
them ill-favouredly.
JAQUES:
Rosalind is your love's name?
ORLANDO:
Yes, just.
JAQUES:
I do not like her name.
ORLANDO:
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
ORLANDO:
christened.
JAQUES:
What stature is she of?
ORLANDO:
Just as high as my heart.
JAQUES:
You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
JAQUES:
acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
JAQUES:
out of rings?
ORLANDO:
Not so, but I answer you right painted cloth, from
ORLANDO:
whence you have studied your questions.
JAQUES:
You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
JAQUES:
Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
JAQUES:
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
JAQUES:
all our misery.
ORLANDO:
I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
ORLANDO:
against whom I know most faults.
JAQUES:
The worst fault you have is to be in love.
ORLANDO:
'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
ORLANDO:
I am weary of you.
JAQUES:
By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
JAQUES:
you.
ORLANDO:
He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
ORLANDO:
shall see him.
JAQUES:
There I shall see mine own figure.
ORLANDO:
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
JAQUES:
I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
JAQUES:
Signior Love.
ORLANDO:
I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
ORLANDO:
Melancholy.
ORLANDO:
Exit JAQUES
ROSALIND:
[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucy
ROSALIND:
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
ROSALIND:
Do you hear, forester?
ORLANDO:
Very well: what would you?
ROSALIND:
I pray you, what is't o'clock?
ORLANDO:
You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
ORLANDO:
in the forest.
ROSALIND:
Then there is no true lover in the forest, else
ROSALIND:
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
ROSALIND:
detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
ORLANDO:
And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
ORLANDO:
been as proper?
ROSALIND:
By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
ROSALIND:
divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
ROSALIND:
withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
ROSALIND:
withal and who he stands still withal.
ORLANDO:
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
ROSALIND:
Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
ROSALIND:
contract of her marriage and the day it is
ROSALIND:
solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
ROSALIND:
Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
ROSALIND:
seven year.
ORLANDO:
Who ambles Time withal?
ROSALIND:
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
ROSALIND:
hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
ROSALIND:
he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
ROSALIND:
he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
ROSALIND:
and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
ROSALIND:
of heavy tedious penury, these Time ambles withal.
ORLANDO:
Who doth he gallop withal?
ROSALIND:
With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
ROSALIND:
softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
ORLANDO:
Who stays it still withal?
ROSALIND:
With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
ROSALIND:
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
ORLANDO:
Where dwell you, pretty youth?
ROSALIND:
With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the
ROSALIND:
skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
ORLANDO:
Are you native of this place?
ROSALIND:
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
ORLANDO:
Your accent is something finer than you could
ORLANDO:
purchase in so removed a dwelling.
ROSALIND:
I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
ROSALIND:
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
ROSALIND:
in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship
ROSALIND:
too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
ROSALIND:
him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
ROSALIND:
I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
ROSALIND:
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
ROSALIND:
whole sex withal.
ORLANDO:
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
ORLANDO:
laid to the charge of women?
ROSALIND:
There were none principal, they were all like one
ROSALIND:
another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
ROSALIND:
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
ORLANDO:
I prithee, recount some of them.
ROSALIND:
No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
ROSALIND:
are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
ROSALIND:
abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
ROSALIND:
their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
ROSALIND:
on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
ROSALIND:
Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
ROSALIND:
give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
ROSALIND:
quotidian of love upon him.
ORLANDO:
I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
ORLANDO:
your remedy.
ROSALIND:
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
ROSALIND:
taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage
ROSALIND:
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
ORLANDO:
What were his marks?
ROSALIND:
A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
ROSALIND:
sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
ROSALIND:
spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
ROSALIND:
which you have not, but I pardon you for that, for
ROSALIND:
simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
ROSALIND:
revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
ROSALIND:
bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
ROSALIND:
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
ROSALIND:
careless desolation, but you are no such man, you
ROSALIND:
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
ROSALIND:
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
ORLANDO:
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
ROSALIND:
Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
ROSALIND:
love believe it, which, I warrant, she is apter to
ROSALIND:
do than to confess she does: that is one of the
ROSALIND:
points in the which women still give the lie to
ROSALIND:
their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
ROSALIND:
that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
ROSALIND:
is so admired?
ORLANDO:
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
ORLANDO:
Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
ROSALIND:
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
ORLANDO:
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
ROSALIND:
Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
ROSALIND:
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
ROSALIND:
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
ROSALIND:
is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
ROSALIND:
are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
ORLANDO:
Did you ever cure any so?
ROSALIND:
Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
ROSALIND:
his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to
ROSALIND:
woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
ROSALIND:
youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
ROSALIND:
and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
ROSALIND:
inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
ROSALIND:
passion something and for no passion truly any
ROSALIND:
thing, as boys and women are for the most part
ROSALIND:
cattle of this colour, would now like him, now loathe
ROSALIND:
him, then entertain him, then forswear him, now weep
ROSALIND:
for him, then spit at him, that I drave my suitor
ROSALIND:
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
ROSALIND:
madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of
ROSALIND:
the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
ROSALIND:
And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon
ROSALIND:
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
ROSALIND:
heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
ORLANDO:
I would not be cured, youth.
ROSALIND:
I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
ROSALIND:
and come every day to my cote and woo me.
ORLANDO:
Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
ORLANDO:
where it is.
ROSALIND:
Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
ROSALIND:
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
ROSALIND:
Will you go?
ORLANDO:
With all my heart, good youth.
ROSALIND:
Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?
ROSALIND:
Exeunt
ROSALIND:
SCENE III. The forest.
ROSALIND:
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY, JAQUES behind
TOUCHSTONE:
Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
TOUCHSTONE:
goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
TOUCHSTONE:
doth my simple feature content you?
AUDREY:
Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!
TOUCHSTONE:
I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
TOUCHSTONE:
capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
JAQUES:
[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
JAQUES:
in a thatched house!
TOUCHSTONE:
When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
TOUCHSTONE:
man's good wit seconded with the forward child
TOUCHSTONE:
Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
TOUCHSTONE:
great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
TOUCHSTONE:
the gods had made thee poetical.
AUDREY:
I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
AUDREY:
deed and word? is it a true thing?
TOUCHSTONE:
No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most
TOUCHSTONE:
feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what
TOUCHSTONE:
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
AUDREY:
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
TOUCHSTONE:
I do, truly, for thou swearest to me thou art
TOUCHSTONE:
honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
TOUCHSTONE:
hope thou didst feign.
AUDREY:
Would you not have me honest?
TOUCHSTONE:
No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured, for
TOUCHSTONE:
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
JAQUES:
[Aside]  A material fool!
AUDREY:
Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods
AUDREY:
make me honest.
TOUCHSTONE:
Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
TOUCHSTONE:
were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
AUDREY:
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
TOUCHSTONE:
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
TOUCHSTONE:
sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
TOUCHSTONE:
be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
TOUCHSTONE:
with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
TOUCHSTONE:
village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
TOUCHSTONE:
of the forest and to couple us.
JAQUES:
[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.
AUDREY:
Well, the gods give us joy!
TOUCHSTONE:
Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
TOUCHSTONE:
stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple
TOUCHSTONE:
but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
TOUCHSTONE:
though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are
TOUCHSTONE:
necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
TOUCHSTONE:
his goods:' right, many a man has good horns, and
TOUCHSTONE:
knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
TOUCHSTONE:
his wife, 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
TOUCHSTONE:
Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer
TOUCHSTONE:
hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
TOUCHSTONE:
therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
TOUCHSTONE:
worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
TOUCHSTONE:
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
TOUCHSTONE:
bachelor, and by how much defence is better than no
TOUCHSTONE:
skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
TOUCHSTONE:
want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
TOUCHSTONE:
Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
TOUCHSTONE:
Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
TOUCHSTONE:
dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
TOUCHSTONE:
with you to your chapel?
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT:
Is there none here to give the woman?
TOUCHSTONE:
I will not take her on gift of any man.
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT:
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
JAQUES:
[Advancing]
JAQUES:
Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.
TOUCHSTONE:
Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
TOUCHSTONE:
sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
TOUCHSTONE:
last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
TOUCHSTONE:
toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.
JAQUES:
Will you be married, motley?
TOUCHSTONE:
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
TOUCHSTONE:
the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires, and
TOUCHSTONE:
as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
JAQUES:
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
JAQUES:
married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
JAQUES:
church, and have a good priest that can tell you
JAQUES:
what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
JAQUES:
together as they join wainscot, then one of you will
JAQUES:
prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
TOUCHSTONE:
[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be
TOUCHSTONE:
married of him than of another: for he is not like
TOUCHSTONE:
to marry me well, and not being well married, it
TOUCHSTONE:
will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
JAQUES:
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
TOUCHSTONE:
'Come, sweet Audrey
TOUCHSTONE:
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
TOUCHSTONE:
Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
TOUCHSTONE:
O sweet Oliver,
TOUCHSTONE:
O brave Oliver,
TOUCHSTONE:
Leave me not behind thee: but,--
TOUCHSTONE:
Wind away,
TOUCHSTONE:
Begone, I say,
TOUCHSTONE:
I will not to wedding with thee.
TOUCHSTONE:
Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT:
'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT:
all shall flout me out of my calling.
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT:
Exit
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT:
SCENE IV. The forest.
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT:
Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
ROSALIND:
Never talk to me, I will weep.
CELIA:
Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider
CELIA:
that tears do not become a man.
ROSALIND:
But have I not cause to weep?
CELIA:
As good cause as one would desire, therefore weep.
ROSALIND:
His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
CELIA:
Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
CELIA:
Judas's own children.
ROSALIND:
I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
CELIA:
An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
ROSALIND:
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
ROSALIND:
of holy bread.
CELIA:
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
CELIA:
of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously,
CELIA:
the very ice of chastity is in them.
ROSALIND:
But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
ROSALIND:
comes not?
CELIA:
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
ROSALIND:
Do you think so?
CELIA:
Yes, I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
CELIA:
horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
CELIA:
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
CELIA:
worm-eaten nut.
ROSALIND:
Not true in love?
CELIA:
Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.
ROSALIND:
You have heard him swear downright he was.
CELIA:
'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
CELIA:
no stronger than the word of a tapster, they are
CELIA:
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
CELIA:
here in the forest on the duke your father.
ROSALIND:
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
ROSALIND:
him: he asked me of what parentage I was, I told
ROSALIND:
him, of as good as he, so he laughed and let me go.
ROSALIND:
But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
ROSALIND:
man as Orlando?
CELIA:
O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
CELIA:
speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
CELIA:
them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
CELIA:
his lover, as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
CELIA:
but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
CELIA:
goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
CELIA:
guides. Who comes here?
CELIA:
Enter CORIN
CORIN:
Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
CORIN:
After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
CORIN:
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
CORIN:
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
CORIN:
That was his mistress.
CELIA:
Well, and what of him?
CORIN:
If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
CORIN:
Between the pale complexion of true love
CORIN:
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
CORIN:
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
CORIN:
If you will mark it.
ROSALIND:
O, come, let us remove
ROSALIND:
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
ROSALIND:
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
ROSALIND:
I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
ROSALIND:
Exeunt
ROSALIND:
SCENE V. Another part of the forest.
ROSALIND:
Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
SILVIUS:
Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me, do not, Phebe,
SILVIUS:
Say that you love me not, but say not so
SILVIUS:
In bitterness. The common executioner,
SILVIUS:
Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
SILVIUS:
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
SILVIUS:
But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
SILVIUS:
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
SILVIUS:
Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind
PHEBE:
I would not be thy executioner
PHEBE:
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
PHEBE:
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye
PHEBE:
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
PHEBE:
That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
PHEBE:
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
PHEBE:
Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
PHEBE:
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,
PHEBE:
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee
PHEBE:
Now counterfeit to swoon, why now fall down,
PHEBE:
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
PHEBE:
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
PHEBE:
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
PHEBE:
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
PHEBE:
Some scar of it, lean but upon a rush,
PHEBE:
The cicatrice and capable impressure
PHEBE:
Thy palm some moment keeps, but now mine eyes,
PHEBE:
Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
PHEBE:
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
PHEBE:
That can do hurt.
SILVIUS:
O dear Phebe,
SILVIUS:
If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
SILVIUS:
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
SILVIUS:
Then shall you know the wounds invisible
SILVIUS:
That love's keen arrows make.
PHEBE:
But till that time
PHEBE:
Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
PHEBE:
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,
PHEBE:
As till that time I shall not pity thee.
ROSALIND:
And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
ROSALIND:
That you insult, exult, and all at once,
ROSALIND:
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
ROSALIND:
As, by my faith, I see no more in you
ROSALIND:
Than without candle may go dark to bed--
ROSALIND:
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
ROSALIND:
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
ROSALIND:
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
ROSALIND:
Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
ROSALIND:
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
ROSALIND:
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it
ROSALIND:
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
ROSALIND:
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
ROSALIND:
That can entame my spirits to your worship.
ROSALIND:
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
ROSALIND:
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
ROSALIND:
You are a thousand times a properer man
ROSALIND:
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
ROSALIND:
That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children
ROSALIND:
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her,
ROSALIND:
And out of you she sees herself more proper
ROSALIND:
Than any of her lineaments can show her.
ROSALIND:
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
ROSALIND:
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love
ROSALIND:
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
ROSALIND:
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets
ROSALIND:
Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer
ROSALIND:
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
ROSALIND:
So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.
PHEBE:
Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together
PHEBE:
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
ROSALIND:
He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
ROSALIND:
fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
ROSALIND:
she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
ROSALIND:
with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
PHEBE:
For no ill will I bear you.
ROSALIND:
I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
ROSALIND:
For I am falser than vows made in wine
ROSALIND:
Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
ROSALIND:
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
ROSALIND:
Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
ROSALIND:
Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
ROSALIND:
And be not proud: though all the world could see,
ROSALIND:
None could be so abused in sight as he.
ROSALIND:
Come, to our flock.
ROSALIND:
Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN
PHEBE:
Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
PHEBE:
'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'
SILVIUS:
Sweet Phebe,--
PHEBE:
Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?
SILVIUS:
Sweet Phebe, pity me.
PHEBE:
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
SILVIUS:
Wherever sorrow is, relief would be
SILVIUS:
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
SILVIUS:
By giving love your sorrow and my grief
SILVIUS:
Were both extermined.
PHEBE:
Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?
SILVIUS:
I would have you.
PHEBE:
Why, that were covetousness.
PHEBE:
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
PHEBE:
And yet it is not that I bear thee love,
PHEBE:
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
PHEBE:
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
PHEBE:
I will endure, and I'll employ thee too
PHEBE:
But do not look for further recompense
PHEBE:
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
SILVIUS:
So holy and so perfect is my love,
SILVIUS:
And I in such a poverty of grace,
SILVIUS:
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
SILVIUS:
To glean the broken ears after the man
SILVIUS:
That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
SILVIUS:
A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.
PHEBE:
Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
SILVIUS:
Not very well, but I have met him oft,
SILVIUS:
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
SILVIUS:
That the old carlot once was master of.
PHEBE:
Think not I love him, though I ask for him
PHEBE:
'Tis but a peevish boy, yet he talks well,
PHEBE:
But what care I for words? yet words do well
PHEBE:
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
PHEBE:
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty
PHEBE:
But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him
PHEBE:
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
PHEBE:
Is his complexion, and faster than his tongue
PHEBE:
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
PHEBE:
He is not very tall, yet for his years he's tall
PHEBE:
His leg is but so so, and yet 'tis well
PHEBE:
There was a pretty redness in his lip,
PHEBE:
A little riper and more lusty red
PHEBE:
Than that mix'd in his cheek, 'twas just the difference
PHEBE:
Between the constant red and mingled damask.
PHEBE:
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
PHEBE:
In parcels as I did, would have gone near
PHEBE:
To fall in love with him, but, for my part,
PHEBE:
I love him not nor hate him not, and yet
PHEBE:
I have more cause to hate him than to love him
PHEBE:
For what had he to do to chide at me?
PHEBE:
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black
PHEBE:
And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me
PHEBE:
I marvel why I answer'd not again
PHEBE:
But that's all one, omittance is no quittance.
PHEBE:
I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
PHEBE:
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?
SILVIUS:
Phebe, with all my heart.
PHEBE:
I'll write it straight,
PHEBE:
The matter's in my head and in my heart
PHEBE:
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
PHEBE:
Go with me, Silvius.
PHEBE:
Exeunt

ACT IV
PHEBE:
SCENE I. The forest.
PHEBE:
Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES
JAQUES:
I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
JAQUES:
with thee.
ROSALIND:
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
JAQUES:
I am so, I do love it better than laughing.
ROSALIND:
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
ROSALIND:
fellows and betray themselves to every modern
ROSALIND:
censure worse than drunkards.
JAQUES:
Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
ROSALIND:
Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
JAQUES:
I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
JAQUES:
emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
JAQUES:
nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
JAQUES:
soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
JAQUES:
which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
JAQUES:
the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
JAQUES:
melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
JAQUES:
extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
JAQUES:
contemplation of my travels, in which my often
JAQUES:
rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.
ROSALIND:
A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
ROSALIND:
be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
ROSALIND:
other men's, then, to have seen much and to have
ROSALIND:
nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
JAQUES:
Yes, I have gained my experience.
ROSALIND:
And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
ROSALIND:
a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
ROSALIND:
sad, and to travel for it too!
ROSALIND:
Enter ORLANDO
ORLANDO:
Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
JAQUES:
Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.
JAQUES:
Exit
ROSALIND:
Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
ROSALIND:
wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
ROSALIND:
own country, be out of love with your nativity and
ROSALIND:
almost chide God for making you that countenance you
ROSALIND:
are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
ROSALIND:
gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
ROSALIND:
all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
ROSALIND:
another trick, never come in my sight more.
ORLANDO:
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
ROSALIND:
Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
ROSALIND:
divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
ROSALIND:
a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
ROSALIND:
affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
ROSALIND:
hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
ROSALIND:
him heart-whole.
ORLANDO:
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
ROSALIND:
had as lief be wooed of a snail.
ORLANDO:
Of a snail?
ROSALIND:
Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he
ROSALIND:
carries his house on his head, a better jointure,
ROSALIND:
I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
ROSALIND:
his destiny with him.
ORLANDO:
What's that?
ROSALIND:
Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
ROSALIND:
beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
ROSALIND:
his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
ORLANDO:
Virtue is no horn-maker, and my Rosalind is virtuous.
ROSALIND:
And I am your Rosalind.
CELIA:
It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a
CELIA:
Rosalind of a better leer than you.
ROSALIND:
Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
ROSALIND:
humour and like enough to consent. What would you
ROSALIND:
say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?
ORLANDO:
I would kiss before I spoke.
ROSALIND:
Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
ROSALIND:
gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
ROSALIND:
occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
ROSALIND:
out, they will spit, and for lovers lacking--God
ROSALIND:
warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
ORLANDO:
How if the kiss be denied?
ROSALIND:
Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
ORLANDO:
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
ROSALIND:
Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
ROSALIND:
I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
ORLANDO:
What, of my suit?
ROSALIND:
Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
ROSALIND:
Am not I your Rosalind?
ORLANDO:
I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
ORLANDO:
talking of her.
ROSALIND:
Well in her person I say I will not have you.
ORLANDO:
Then in mine own person I die.
ROSALIND:
No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
ROSALIND:
almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
ROSALIND:
there was not any man died in his own person,
ROSALIND:
videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
ROSALIND:
dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he
ROSALIND:
could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
ROSALIND:
of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
ROSALIND:
year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
ROSALIND:
for a hot midsummer night, for, good youth, he went
ROSALIND:
but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
ROSALIND:
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
ROSALIND:
coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
ROSALIND:
But these are all lies: men have died from time to
ROSALIND:
time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
ORLANDO:
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
ORLANDO:
for, I protest, her frown might kill me.
ROSALIND:
By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
ROSALIND:
I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
ROSALIND:
disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
ROSALIND:
it.
ORLANDO:
Then love me, Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
ORLANDO:
And wilt thou have me?
ROSALIND:
Ay, and twenty such.
ORLANDO:
What sayest thou?
ROSALIND:
Are you not good?
ORLANDO:
I hope so.
ROSALIND:
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
ROSALIND:
Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
ROSALIND:
Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?
ORLANDO:
Pray thee, marry us.
CELIA:
I cannot say the words.
ROSALIND:
You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'
CELIA:
Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
ORLANDO:
I will.
ROSALIND:
Ay, but when?
ORLANDO:
Why now, as fast as she can marry us.
ROSALIND:
Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
ORLANDO:
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
ROSALIND:
I might ask you for your commission, but I do take
ROSALIND:
thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
ROSALIND:
before the priest, and certainly a woman's thought
ROSALIND:
runs before her actions.
ORLANDO:
So do all thoughts, they are winged.
ROSALIND:
Now tell me how long you would have her after you
ROSALIND:
have possessed her.
ORLANDO:
For ever and a day.
ROSALIND:
Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando,
ROSALIND:
men are April when they woo, December when they wed
ROSALIND:
maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
ROSALIND:
changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
ROSALIND:
of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
ROSALIND:
more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
ROSALIND:
new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
ROSALIND:
than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
ROSALIND:
in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
ROSALIND:
disposed to be merry, I will laugh like a hyen, and
ROSALIND:
that when thou art inclined to sleep.
ORLANDO:
But will my Rosalind do so?
ROSALIND:
By my life, she will do as I do.
ORLANDO:
O, but she is wise.
ROSALIND:
Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
ROSALIND:
wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
ROSALIND:
wit and it will out at the casement, shut that and
ROSALIND:
'twill out at the key-hole, stop that, 'twill fly
ROSALIND:
with the smoke out at the chimney.
ORLANDO:
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
ORLANDO:
'Wit, whither wilt?'
ROSALIND:
Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
ROSALIND:
your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
ORLANDO:
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
ROSALIND:
Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
ROSALIND:
never take her without her answer, unless you take
ROSALIND:
her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
ROSALIND:
make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
ROSALIND:
never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
ROSALIND:
it like a fool!
ORLANDO:
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
ROSALIND:
Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
ORLANDO:
I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
ORLANDO:
will be with thee again.
ROSALIND:
Ay, go your ways, go your ways, I knew what you
ROSALIND:
would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
ROSALIND:
thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
ROSALIND:
won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
ROSALIND:
death! Two o'clock is your hour?
ORLANDO:
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
ROSALIND:
me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
ROSALIND:
if you break one jot of your promise or come one
ROSALIND:
minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
ROSALIND:
pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
ROSALIND:
and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
ROSALIND:
may be chosen out of the gross band of the
ROSALIND:
unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
ROSALIND:
your promise.
ORLANDO:
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
ORLANDO:
Rosalind: so adieu.
ROSALIND:
Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
ROSALIND:
offenders, and let Time try: adieu.
ROSALIND:
Exit ORLANDO
CELIA:
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate
CELIA:
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
CELIA:
head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
CELIA:
her own nest.
ROSALIND:
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
ROSALIND:
didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
ROSALIND:
it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
ROSALIND:
bottom, like the bay of Portugal.
CELIA:
Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
CELIA:
affection in, it runs out.
ROSALIND:
No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
ROSALIND:
of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
ROSALIND:
that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
ROSALIND:
because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
ROSALIND:
am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
ROSALIND:
of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
ROSALIND:
sigh till he come.
CELIA:
And I'll sleep.
CELIA:
Exeunt
CELIA:
SCENE II. The forest.
CELIA:
Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters
JAQUES:
Which is he that killed the deer?
A Lord:
Sir, it was I.
JAQUES:
Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
JAQUES:
conqueror, and it would do well to set the deer's
JAQUES:
horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
JAQUES:
you no song, forester, for this purpose?
Forester:
Yes, sir.
JAQUES:
Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
JAQUES:
make noise enough.
JAQUES:
SONG.
Forester:
What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
Forester:
His leather skin and horns to wear.
Forester:
Then sing him home,
Forester:
The rest shall bear this burden
Forester:
Take thou no scorn to wear the horn,
Forester:
It was a crest ere thou wast born
Forester:
Thy father's father wore it,
Forester:
And thy father bore it
Forester:
The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
Forester:
Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
Forester:
Exeunt
Forester:
SCENE III. The forest.
Forester:
Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
ROSALIND:
How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
ROSALIND:
here much Orlando!
CELIA:
I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
CELIA:
hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
CELIA:
sleep. Look, who comes here.
CELIA:
Enter SILVIUS
SILVIUS:
My errand is to you, fair youth,
SILVIUS:
My gentle Phebe bid me give you this
SILVIUS:
I know not the contents, but, as I guess
SILVIUS:
By the stern brow and waspish action
SILVIUS:
Which she did use as she was writing of it,
SILVIUS:
It bears an angry tenor: pardon me
SILVIUS:
I am but as a guiltless messenger.
ROSALIND:
Patience herself would startle at this letter
ROSALIND:
And play the swaggerer, bear this, bear all
ROSALIND:
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners,
ROSALIND:
She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
ROSALIND:
Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
ROSALIND:
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt
ROSALIND:
Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
ROSALIND:
This is a letter of your own device.
SILVIUS:
No, I protest, I know not the contents
SILVIUS:
Phebe did write it.
ROSALIND:
Come, come, you are a fool
ROSALIND:
And turn'd into the extremity of love.
ROSALIND:
I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
ROSALIND:
A freestone-colour'd hand, I verily did think
ROSALIND:
That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands
ROSALIND:
She has a huswife's hand, but that's no matter
ROSALIND:
I say she never did invent this letter,
ROSALIND:
This is a man's invention and his hand.
SILVIUS:
Sure, it is hers.
ROSALIND:
Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
ROSALIND:
A style for-challengers, why, she defies me,
ROSALIND:
Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
ROSALIND:
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
ROSALIND:
Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
ROSALIND:
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
SILVIUS:
So please you, for I never heard it yet,
SILVIUS:
Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
ROSALIND:
She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
ROSALIND:
Reads
ROSALIND:
Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
ROSALIND:
That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
ROSALIND:
Can a woman rail thus?
SILVIUS:
Call you this railing?
ROSALIND:
[Reads]
ROSALIND:
Why, thy godhead laid apart,
ROSALIND:
Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
ROSALIND:
Did you ever hear such railing?
ROSALIND:
Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
ROSALIND:
That could do no vengeance to me.
ROSALIND:
Meaning me a beast.
ROSALIND:
If the scorn of your bright eyne
ROSALIND:
Have power to raise such love in mine,
ROSALIND:
Alack, in me what strange effect
ROSALIND:
Would they work in mild aspect!
ROSALIND:
Whiles you chid me, I did love,
ROSALIND:
How then might your prayers move!
ROSALIND:
He that brings this love to thee
ROSALIND:
Little knows this love in me
ROSALIND:
And by him seal up thy mind,
ROSALIND:
Whether that thy youth and kind
ROSALIND:
Will the faithful offer take
ROSALIND:
Of me and all that I can make,
ROSALIND:
Or else by him my love deny,
ROSALIND:
And then I'll study how to die.
SILVIUS:
Call you this chiding?
CELIA:
Alas, poor shepherd!
ROSALIND:
Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt
ROSALIND:
thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
ROSALIND:
instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
ROSALIND:
be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
ROSALIND:
love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
ROSALIND:
her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
ROSALIND:
thee, if she will not, I will never have her unless
ROSALIND:
thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
ROSALIND:
hence, and not a word, for here comes more company.
ROSALIND:
Exit SILVIUS
ROSALIND:
Enter OLIVER
OLIVER:
Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,
OLIVER:
Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
OLIVER:
A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?
CELIA:
West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom
CELIA:
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
CELIA:
Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
CELIA:
But at this hour the house doth keep itself,
CELIA:
There's none within.
OLIVER:
If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
OLIVER:
Then should I know you by description,
OLIVER:
Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
OLIVER:
Of female favour, and bestows himself
OLIVER:
Like a ripe sister: the woman low
OLIVER:
And browner than her brother.' Are not you
OLIVER:
The owner of the house I did inquire for?
CELIA:
It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
OLIVER:
Orlando doth commend him to you both,
OLIVER:
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
OLIVER:
He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
ROSALIND:
I am: what must we understand by this?
OLIVER:
Some of my shame, if you will know of me
OLIVER:
What man I am, and how, and why, and where
OLIVER:
This handkercher was stain'd.
CELIA:
I pray you, tell it.
OLIVER:
When last the young Orlando parted from you
OLIVER:
He left a promise to return again
OLIVER:
Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
OLIVER:
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
OLIVER:
Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
OLIVER:
And mark what object did present itself
OLIVER:
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
OLIVER:
And high top bald with dry antiquity,
OLIVER:
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
OLIVER:
Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
OLIVER:
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
OLIVER:
Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
OLIVER:
The opening of his mouth, but suddenly,
OLIVER:
Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
OLIVER:
And with indented glides did slip away
OLIVER:
Into a bush: under which bush's shade
OLIVER:
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
OLIVER:
Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
OLIVER:
When that the sleeping man should stir, for 'tis
OLIVER:
The royal disposition of that beast
OLIVER:
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
OLIVER:
This seen, Orlando did approach the man
OLIVER:
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
CELIA:
O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,
CELIA:
And he did render him the most unnatural
CELIA:
That lived amongst men.
OLIVER:
And well he might so do,
OLIVER:
For well I know he was unnatural.
ROSALIND:
But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
ROSALIND:
Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
OLIVER:
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so,
OLIVER:
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
OLIVER:
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
OLIVER:
Made him give battle to the lioness,
OLIVER:
Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
OLIVER:
From miserable slumber I awaked.
CELIA:
Are you his brother?
ROSALIND:
Wast you he rescued?
CELIA:
Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
OLIVER:
'Twas I, but 'tis not I	I do not shame
OLIVER:
To tell you what I was, since my conversion
OLIVER:
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
ROSALIND:
But, for the bloody napkin?
OLIVER:
By and by.
OLIVER:
When from the first to last betwixt us two
OLIVER:
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
OLIVER:
As how I came into that desert place:--
OLIVER:
In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
OLIVER:
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
OLIVER:
Committing me unto my brother's love,
OLIVER:
Who led me instantly unto his cave,
OLIVER:
There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
OLIVER:
The lioness had torn some flesh away,
OLIVER:
Which all this while had bled, and now he fainted
OLIVER:
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
OLIVER:
Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,
OLIVER:
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
OLIVER:
He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
OLIVER:
To tell this story, that you might excuse
OLIVER:
His broken promise, and to give this napkin
OLIVER:
Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
OLIVER:
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
OLIVER:
ROSALIND swoons
CELIA:
Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
OLIVER:
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
CELIA:
There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
OLIVER:
Look, he recovers.
ROSALIND:
I would I were at home.
CELIA:
We'll lead you thither.
CELIA:
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
OLIVER:
Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a
OLIVER:
man's heart.
ROSALIND:
I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would
ROSALIND:
think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell
ROSALIND:
your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
OLIVER:
This was not counterfeit: there is too great
OLIVER:
testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
OLIVER:
of earnest.
ROSALIND:
Counterfeit, I assure you.
OLIVER:
Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
ROSALIND:
So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.
CELIA:
Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw
CELIA:
homewards. Good sir, go with us.
OLIVER:
That will I, for I must bear answer back
OLIVER:
How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend
ROSALIND:
my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?
ROSALIND:
Exeunt
ROSALIND:
ACT V
ROSALIND:
SCENE I. The forest.
ROSALIND:
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
TOUCHSTONE:
We shall find a time, Audrey, patience, gentle Audrey.
AUDREY:
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
AUDREY:
gentleman's saying.
TOUCHSTONE:
A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile
TOUCHSTONE:
Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the
TOUCHSTONE:
forest lays claim to you.
AUDREY:
Ay, I know who 'tis, he hath no interest in me in
AUDREY:
the world: here comes the man you mean.
TOUCHSTONE:
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my
TOUCHSTONE:
troth, we that have good wits have much to answer
TOUCHSTONE:
for, we shall be flouting, we cannot hold.
TOUCHSTONE:
Enter WILLIAM
WILLIAM:
Good even, Audrey.
AUDREY:
God ye good even, William.
WILLIAM:
And good even to you, sir.
TOUCHSTONE:
Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
TOUCHSTONE:
head, nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?
WILLIAM:
Five and twenty, sir.
TOUCHSTONE:
A ripe age. Is thy name William?
WILLIAM:
William, sir.
TOUCHSTONE:
A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?
WILLIAM:
Ay, sir, I thank God.
TOUCHSTONE:
'Thank God,' a good answer. Art rich?
WILLIAM:
Faith, sir, so so.
TOUCHSTONE:
'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good, and
TOUCHSTONE:
yet it is not, it is but so so. Art thou wise?
WILLIAM:
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
TOUCHSTONE:
Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,
TOUCHSTONE:
'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
TOUCHSTONE:
knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen
TOUCHSTONE:
philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
TOUCHSTONE:
would open his lips when he put it into his mouth,
TOUCHSTONE:
meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
TOUCHSTONE:
lips to open. You do love this maid?
WILLIAM:
I do, sir.
TOUCHSTONE:
Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
WILLIAM:
No, sir.
TOUCHSTONE:
Then learn this of me: to have, is to have, for it
TOUCHSTONE:
is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out
TOUCHSTONE:
of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty
TOUCHSTONE:
the other, for all your writers do consent that ipse
TOUCHSTONE:
is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
WILLIAM:
Which he, sir?
TOUCHSTONE:
He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
TOUCHSTONE:
clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the
TOUCHSTONE:
society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this
TOUCHSTONE:
female,--which in the common is woman, which
TOUCHSTONE:
together is, abandon the society of this female, or,
TOUCHSTONE:
clown, thou perishest, or, to thy better
TOUCHSTONE:
understanding, diest, or, to wit I kill thee, make
TOUCHSTONE:
thee away, translate thy life into death, thy
TOUCHSTONE:
liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with
TOUCHSTONE:
thee, or in bastinado, or in steel, I will bandy
TOUCHSTONE:
with thee in faction, I will o'errun thee with
TOUCHSTONE:
policy, I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways
TOUCHSTONE:
therefore tremble and depart.
AUDREY:
Do, good William.
WILLIAM:
God rest you merry, sir.
WILLIAM:
Exit
WILLIAM:
Enter CORIN
CORIN:
Our master and mistress seeks you, come, away, away!
TOUCHSTONE:
Trip, Audrey! trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend.
TOUCHSTONE:
Exeunt

SCENE II. The forest.
TOUCHSTONE:
Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER
ORLANDO:
Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you
ORLANDO:
should like her? that but seeing you should love
ORLANDO:
her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should
ORLANDO:
grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?
OLIVER:
Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the
OLIVER:
poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden
OLIVER:
wooing, nor her sudden consenting, but say with me,
OLIVER:
I love Aliena, say with her that she loves me,
OLIVER:
consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
OLIVER:
shall be to your good, for my father's house and all
OLIVER:
the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I
OLIVER:
estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
ORLANDO:
You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow
ORLANDO:
thither will I invite the duke and all's contented
ORLANDO:
followers. Go you and prepare Aliena, for look
ORLANDO:
you, here comes my Rosalind.
ORLANDO:
Enter ROSALIND
ROSALIND:
God save you, brother.
OLIVER:
And you, fair sister.
OLIVER:
Exit
ROSALIND:
O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee
ROSALIND:
wear thy heart in a scarf!
ORLANDO:
It is my arm.
ROSALIND:
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
ROSALIND:
of a lion.
ORLANDO:
Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
ROSALIND:
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
ROSALIND:
swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?
ORLANDO:
Ay, and greater wonders than that.
ROSALIND:
O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was
ROSALIND:
never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
ROSALIND:
and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and
ROSALIND:
overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
ROSALIND:
met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
ROSALIND:
loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
ROSALIND:
sighed but they asked one another the reason, no
ROSALIND:
sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy,
ROSALIND:
and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
ROSALIND:
to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
ROSALIND:
else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
ROSALIND:
the very wrath of love and they will together, clubs
ROSALIND:
cannot part them.
ORLANDO:
They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the
ORLANDO:
duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it
ORLANDO:
is to look into happiness through another man's
ORLANDO:
eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
ORLANDO:
the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
ORLANDO:
think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
ROSALIND:
Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
ORLANDO:
I can live no longer by thinking.
ROSALIND:
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
ROSALIND:
Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
ROSALIND:
that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
ROSALIND:
speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
ROSALIND:
of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are,
ROSALIND:
neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
ROSALIND:
some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
ROSALIND:
yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
ROSALIND:
you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
ROSALIND:
since I was three year old, conversed with a
ROSALIND:
magician, most profound in his art and yet not
ROSALIND:
damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
ROSALIND:
as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
ROSALIND:
marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
ROSALIND:
what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is
ROSALIND:
not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
ROSALIND:
to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
ROSALIND:
as she is and without any danger.
ORLANDO:
Speakest thou in sober meanings?
ROSALIND:
By my life, I do, which I tender dearly, though I
ROSALIND:
say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your
ROSALIND:
best array: bid your friends, for if you will be
ROSALIND:
married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.
ROSALIND:
Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
ROSALIND:
Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.
PHEBE:
Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
PHEBE:
To show the letter that I writ to you.
ROSALIND:
I care not if I have: it is my study
ROSALIND:
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you
ROSALIND:
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd,
ROSALIND:
Look upon him, love him, he worships you.
PHEBE:
Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
SILVIUS:
It is to be all made of sighs and tears,
SILVIUS:
And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE:
And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO:
And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
And I for no woman.
SILVIUS:
It is to be all made of faith and service,
SILVIUS:
And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE:
And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO:
And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
And I for no woman.
SILVIUS:
It is to be all made of fantasy,
SILVIUS:
All made of passion and all made of wishes,
SILVIUS:
All adoration, duty, and observance,
SILVIUS:
All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
SILVIUS:
All purity, all trial, all observance,
SILVIUS:
And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE:
And so am I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO:
And so am I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND:
And so am I for no woman.
PHEBE:
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
SILVIUS:
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ORLANDO:
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ROSALIND:
Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
ORLANDO:
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
ROSALIND:
Pray you, no more of this, 'tis like the howling
ROSALIND:
of Irish wolves against the moon.
ROSALIND:
To SILVIUS
ROSALIND:
I will help you, if I can
ROSALIND:
To PHEBE
ROSALIND:
I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.
ROSALIND:
To PHEBE
ROSALIND:
I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be
ROSALIND:
married to-morrow
ROSALIND:
To ORLANDO
ROSALIND:
I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
ROSALIND:
shall be married to-morrow
ROSALIND:
To SILVIUS
ROSALIND:
I will content you, if what pleases you contents
ROSALIND:
you, and you shall be married to-morrow.
ROSALIND:
To ORLANDO
ROSALIND:
As you love Rosalind, meet
ROSALIND:
To SILVIUS
ROSALIND:
as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,
ROSALIND:
I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.
SILVIUS:
I'll not fail, if I live.
PHEBE:
Nor I.
ORLANDO:
Nor I.
ORLANDO:
Exeunt
ORLANDO:
SCENE III. The forest.
ORLANDO:
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
TOUCHSTONE:
To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey, to-morrow will
TOUCHSTONE:
we be married.
AUDREY:
I do desire it with all my heart, and I hope it is
AUDREY:
no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
AUDREY:
world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.
AUDREY:
Enter two Pages
First Page:
Well met, honest gentleman.
TOUCHSTONE:
By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.
Second Page:
We are for you: sit i' the middle.
First Page:
Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or
First Page:
spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only
First Page:
prologues to a bad voice?
Second Page:
I'faith, i'faith, and both in a tune, like two
Second Page:
gipsies on a horse.
Second Page:
SONG.
Second Page:
It was a lover and his lass,
Second Page:
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
Second Page:
That o'er the green corn-field did pass
Second Page:
In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
Second Page:
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding
Second Page:
Sweet lovers love the spring.
Second Page:
Between the acres of the rye,
Second Page:
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino
Second Page:
These pretty country folks would lie,
Second Page:
In spring time,  and c.
Second Page:
This carol they began that hour,
Second Page:
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
Second Page:
How that a life was but a flower
Second Page:
In spring time,  and c.
Second Page:
And therefore take the present time,
Second Page:
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
Second Page:
For love is crowned with the prime
Second Page:
In spring time,  and c.
TOUCHSTONE:
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
TOUCHSTONE:
matter in the ditty, yet the note was very
TOUCHSTONE:
untuneable.
First Page:
You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.
TOUCHSTONE:
By my troth, yes, I count it but time lost to hear
TOUCHSTONE:
such a foolish song. God be wi' you, and God mend
TOUCHSTONE:
your voices! Come, Audrey.
TOUCHSTONE:
Exeunt
TOUCHSTONE:
SCENE IV. The forest.
TOUCHSTONE:
Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA
DUKE SENIOR:
Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
DUKE SENIOR:
Can do all this that he hath promised?
ORLANDO:
I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not,
ORLANDO:
As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
ORLANDO:
Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE
ROSALIND:
Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged
ROSALIND:
You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
ROSALIND:
You will bestow her on Orlando here?
DUKE SENIOR:
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
ROSALIND:
And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?
ORLANDO:
That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
ROSALIND:
You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?
PHEBE:
That will I, should I die the hour after.
ROSALIND:
But if you do refuse to marry me,
ROSALIND:
You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
PHEBE:
So is the bargain.
ROSALIND:
You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
SILVIUS:
Though to have her and death were both one thing.
ROSALIND:
I have promised to make all this matter even.
ROSALIND:
Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter,
ROSALIND:
You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter
ROSALIND:
Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
ROSALIND:
Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd
ROSALIND:
Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.
ROSALIND:
If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
ROSALIND:
To make these doubts all even.
ROSALIND:
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
DUKE SENIOR:
I do remember in this shepherd boy
DUKE SENIOR:
Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
ORLANDO:
My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
ORLANDO:
Methought he was a brother to your daughter
ORLANDO:
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
ORLANDO:
And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
ORLANDO:
Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
ORLANDO:
Whom he reports to be a great magician,
ORLANDO:
Obscured in the circle of this forest.
ORLANDO:
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
JAQUES:
There is, sure, another flood toward, and these
JAQUES:
couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
JAQUES:
very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.
TOUCHSTONE:
Salutation and greeting to you all!
JAQUES:
Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
JAQUES:
motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
JAQUES:
the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.
TOUCHSTONE:
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
TOUCHSTONE:
purgation. I have trod a measure, I have flattered
TOUCHSTONE:
a lady, I have been politic with my friend, smooth
TOUCHSTONE:
with mine enemy, I have undone three tailors, I have
TOUCHSTONE:
had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
JAQUES:
And how was that ta'en up?
TOUCHSTONE:
Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
TOUCHSTONE:
seventh cause.
JAQUES:
How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
DUKE SENIOR:
I like him very well.
TOUCHSTONE:
God 'ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I
TOUCHSTONE:
press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
TOUCHSTONE:
copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
TOUCHSTONE:
marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
TOUCHSTONE:
sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own, a poor
TOUCHSTONE:
humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
TOUCHSTONE:
will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
TOUCHSTONE:
poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.
DUKE SENIOR:
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
TOUCHSTONE:
According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
JAQUES:
But, for the seventh cause, how did you find the
JAQUES:
quarrel on the seventh cause?
TOUCHSTONE:
Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
TOUCHSTONE:
seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
TOUCHSTONE:
cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
TOUCHSTONE:
if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
TOUCHSTONE:
mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
TOUCHSTONE:
If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
TOUCHSTONE:
would send me word, he cut it to please himself
TOUCHSTONE:
this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
TOUCHSTONE:
not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
TOUCHSTONE:
called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
TOUCHSTONE:
well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
TOUCHSTONE:
is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
TOUCHSTONE:
well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
TOUCHSTONE:
Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
TOUCHSTONE:
Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
JAQUES:
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
TOUCHSTONE:
I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
TOUCHSTONE:
nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct, and so we
TOUCHSTONE:
measured swords and parted.
JAQUES:
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
TOUCHSTONE:
O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have
TOUCHSTONE:
books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
TOUCHSTONE:
The first, the Retort Courteous, the second, the
TOUCHSTONE:
Quip Modest, the third, the Reply Churlish, the
TOUCHSTONE:
fourth, the Reproof Valiant, the fifth, the
TOUCHSTONE:
Countercheque Quarrelsome, the sixth, the Lie with
TOUCHSTONE:
Circumstance, the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
TOUCHSTONE:
these you may avoid but the Lie Direct, and you may
TOUCHSTONE:
avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
TOUCHSTONE:
justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
TOUCHSTONE:
parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
TOUCHSTONE:
of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so,' and
TOUCHSTONE:
they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
TOUCHSTONE:
only peacemaker, much virtue in If.
JAQUES:
Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
JAQUES:
any thing and yet a fool.
DUKE SENIOR:
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
DUKE SENIOR:
the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
DUKE SENIOR:
Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA
DUKE SENIOR:
Still Music
HYMEN:
Then is there mirth in heaven,
HYMEN:
When earthly things made even
HYMEN:
Atone together.
HYMEN:
Good duke, receive thy daughter
HYMEN:
Hymen from heaven brought her,
HYMEN:
Yea, brought her hither,
HYMEN:
That thou mightst join her hand with his
HYMEN:
Whose heart within his bosom is.
ROSALIND:
[To DUKE SENIOR]  To you I give myself, for I am yours.
ROSALIND:
To ORLANDO
ROSALIND:
To you I give myself, for I am yours.
DUKE SENIOR:
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
ORLANDO:
If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
PHEBE:
If sight and shape be true,
PHEBE:
Why then, my love adieu!
ROSALIND:
I'll have no father, if you be not he
ROSALIND:
I'll have no husband, if you be not he
ROSALIND:
Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
HYMEN:
Peace, ho! I bar confusion
HYMEN:
'Tis I must make conclusion
HYMEN:
Of these most strange events
HYMEN:
Here's eight that must take hands
HYMEN:
To join in Hymen's bands,
HYMEN:
If truth holds true contents.
HYMEN:
You and you no cross shall part
HYMEN:
You and you are heart in heart
HYMEN:
You to his love must accord,
HYMEN:
Or have a woman to your lord
HYMEN:
You and you are sure together,
HYMEN:
As the winter to foul weather.
HYMEN:
Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
HYMEN:
Feed yourselves with questioning,
HYMEN:
That reason wonder may diminish,
HYMEN:
How thus we met, and these things finish.
HYMEN:
SONG.
HYMEN:
Wedding is great Juno's crown
HYMEN:
O blessed bond of board and bed!
HYMEN:
'Tis Hymen peoples every town,
HYMEN:
High wedlock then be honoured
HYMEN:
Honour, high honour and renown,
HYMEN:
To Hymen, god of every town!
DUKE SENIOR:
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
DUKE SENIOR:
Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.
PHEBE:
I will not eat my word, now thou art mine,
PHEBE:
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
PHEBE:
Enter JAQUES DE BOYS
JAQUES DE BOYS:
Let me have audience for a word or two
JAQUES DE BOYS:
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
JAQUES DE BOYS:
That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
JAQUES DE BOYS:
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
JAQUES DE BOYS:
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
JAQUES DE BOYS:
Address'd a mighty power, which were on foot,
JAQUES DE BOYS:
In his own conduct, purposely to take
JAQUES DE BOYS:
His brother here and put him to the sword
JAQUES DE BOYS:
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
JAQUES DE BOYS:
Where meeting with an old religious man,
JAQUES DE BOYS:
After some question with him, was converted
JAQUES DE BOYS:
Both from his enterprise and from the world,
JAQUES DE BOYS:
His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
JAQUES DE BOYS:
And all their lands restored to them again
JAQUES DE BOYS:
That were with him exiled. This to be true,
JAQUES DE BOYS:
I do engage my life.
DUKE SENIOR:
Welcome, young man,
DUKE SENIOR:
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding
DUKE SENIOR:
To one his lands withheld, and to the other
DUKE SENIOR:
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
DUKE SENIOR:
First, in this forest, let us do those ends
DUKE SENIOR:
That here were well begun and well begot
DUKE SENIOR:
And after, every of this happy number
DUKE SENIOR:
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
DUKE SENIOR:
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
DUKE SENIOR:
According to the measure of their states.
DUKE SENIOR:
Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
DUKE SENIOR:
And fall into our rustic revelry.
DUKE SENIOR:
Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
DUKE SENIOR:
With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.
JAQUES:
Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
JAQUES:
The duke hath put on a religious life
JAQUES:
And thrown into neglect the pompous court?
JAQUES DE BOYS:
He hath.
JAQUES:
To him will I : out of these convertites
JAQUES:
There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
JAQUES:
To DUKE SENIOR
JAQUES:
You to your former honour I bequeath,
JAQUES:
Your patience and your virtue well deserves it
JAQUES:
To ORLANDO
JAQUES:
You to a love that your true faith doth merit
JAQUES:
To OLIVER
JAQUES:
You to your land and love and great allies
JAQUES:
To SILVIUS
JAQUES:
You to a long and well-deserved bed
JAQUES:
To TOUCHSTONE
JAQUES:
And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage
JAQUES:
Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures
JAQUES:
I am for other than for dancing measures.
DUKE SENIOR:
Stay, Jaques, stay.
JAQUES:
To see no pastime I	what you would have
JAQUES:
I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.
JAQUES:
Exit
DUKE SENIOR:
Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
DUKE SENIOR:
As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.
DUKE SENIOR:
A dance
DUKE SENIOR:
EPILOGUE
ROSALIND:
It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue,
ROSALIND:
but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
ROSALIND:
the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
ROSALIND:
no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no
ROSALIND:
epilogue, yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
ROSALIND:
and good plays prove the better by the help of good
ROSALIND:
epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
ROSALIND:
neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
ROSALIND:
you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
ROSALIND:
furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
ROSALIND:
become me: my way is to conjure you, and I'll begin
ROSALIND:
with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
ROSALIND:
you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
ROSALIND:
please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
ROSALIND:
you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,
ROSALIND:
none of you hates them--that between you and the
ROSALIND:
women the play may please. If I were a woman I
ROSALIND:
would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
ROSALIND:
me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
ROSALIND:
defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
ROSALIND:
beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
ROSALIND:
kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
ROSALIND:
Exeunt
