SUFFOLK:
ACT I
SUFFOLK:
SCENE I. London. The palace.
SUFFOLK:
Flourish of trumpets: then hautboys. Enter KING  HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and  CARDINAL, on the one side, QUEEN MARGARET, SUFFOLK, YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other
SUFFOLK:
As by your high imperial majesty
SUFFOLK:
I had in charge at my depart for France,
SUFFOLK:
As procurator to your excellence,
SUFFOLK:
To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,
SUFFOLK:
So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
SUFFOLK:
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,
SUFFOLK:
The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,
SUFFOLK:
Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,
SUFFOLK:
I have perform'd my task and was espoused
SUFFOLK:
And humbly now upon my bended knee,
SUFFOLK:
In sight of England and her lordly peers,
SUFFOLK:
Deliver up my title in the queen
SUFFOLK:
To your most gracious hands, that are the substance
SUFFOLK:
Of that great shadow I did represent,
SUFFOLK:
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,
SUFFOLK:
The fairest queen that ever king received.
KING HENRY VI:
Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret
KING HENRY VI:
I can express no kinder sign of love
KING HENRY VI:
Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,
KING HENRY VI:
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!
KING HENRY VI:
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
KING HENRY VI:
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
KING HENRY VI:
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Great King of England and my gracious lord,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The mutual conference that my mind hath had,
QUEEN MARGARET:
By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,
QUEEN MARGARET:
In courtly company or at my beads,
QUEEN MARGARET:
With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Makes me the bolder to salute my king
QUEEN MARGARET:
With ruder terms, such as my wit affords
QUEEN MARGARET:
And over-joy of heart doth minister.
KING HENRY VI:
Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,
KING HENRY VI:
Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,
KING HENRY VI:
Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys,
KING HENRY VI:
Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
KING HENRY VI:
Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.
ALL:
[Kneeling]  Long live Queen Margaret, England's
ALL:
happiness!
QUEEN MARGARET:
We thank you all.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Flourish
SUFFOLK:
My lord protector, so it please your grace,
SUFFOLK:
Here are the articles of contracted peace
SUFFOLK:
Between our sovereign and the French king Charles,
SUFFOLK:
For eighteen months concluded by consent.
GLOUCESTER:
[Reads]  'Imprimis, it is agreed between the French
GLOUCESTER:
king Charles, and William de la Pole, Marquess of
GLOUCESTER:
Suffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, that
GLOUCESTER:
the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,
GLOUCESTER:
daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and
GLOUCESTER:
Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the
GLOUCESTER:
thirtieth of May next ensuing. Item, that the duchy
GLOUCESTER:
of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released
GLOUCESTER:
and delivered to the king her father'--
GLOUCESTER:
Lets the paper fall
KING HENRY VI:
Uncle, how now!
GLOUCESTER:
Pardon me, gracious lord,
GLOUCESTER:
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
GLOUCESTER:
And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.
KING HENRY VI:
Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
CARDINAL:
[Reads]  'Item, It is further agreed between them,
CARDINAL:
that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be
CARDINAL:
released and delivered over to the king her father,
CARDINAL:
and she sent over of the King of England's own
CARDINAL:
proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.'
KING HENRY VI:
They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down
KING HENRY VI:
We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,
KING HENRY VI:
And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
KING HENRY VI:
We here discharge your grace from being regent
KING HENRY VI:
I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months
KING HENRY VI:
Be full expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester,
KING HENRY VI:
Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,
KING HENRY VI:
Salisbury, and Warwick,
KING HENRY VI:
We thank you all for the great favour done,
KING HENRY VI:
In entertainment to my princely queen.
KING HENRY VI:
Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
KING HENRY VI:
To see her coronation be perform'd.
KING HENRY VI:
Exeunt KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SUFFOLK
GLOUCESTER:
Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,
GLOUCESTER:
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,
GLOUCESTER:
Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
GLOUCESTER:
What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
GLOUCESTER:
His valour, coin and people, in the wars?
GLOUCESTER:
Did he so often lodge in open field,
GLOUCESTER:
In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,
GLOUCESTER:
To conquer France, his true inheritance?
GLOUCESTER:
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,
GLOUCESTER:
To keep by policy what Henry got?
GLOUCESTER:
Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,
GLOUCESTER:
Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,
GLOUCESTER:
Received deep scars in France and Normandy?
GLOUCESTER:
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
GLOUCESTER:
With all the learned council of the realm,
GLOUCESTER:
Studied so long, sat in the council-house
GLOUCESTER:
Early and late, debating to and fro
GLOUCESTER:
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
GLOUCESTER:
And had his highness in his infancy
GLOUCESTER:
Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?
GLOUCESTER:
And shall these labours and these honours die?
GLOUCESTER:
Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,
GLOUCESTER:
Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?
GLOUCESTER:
O peers of England, shameful is this league!
GLOUCESTER:
Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
GLOUCESTER:
Blotting your names from books of memory,
GLOUCESTER:
Razing the characters of your renown,
GLOUCESTER:
Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
GLOUCESTER:
Undoing all, as all had never been!
CARDINAL:
Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,
CARDINAL:
This peroration with such circumstance?
CARDINAL:
For France, 'tis ours, and we will keep it still.
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can,
GLOUCESTER:
But now it is impossible we should
GLOUCESTER:
Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,
GLOUCESTER:
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
GLOUCESTER:
Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
GLOUCESTER:
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
SALISBURY:
Now, by the death of Him that died for all,
SALISBURY:
These counties were the keys of Normandy.
SALISBURY:
But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?
WARWICK:
For grief that they are past recovery
WARWICK:
For, were there hope to conquer them again,
WARWICK:
My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.
WARWICK:
Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both,
WARWICK:
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer
WARWICK:
And are the cities, that I got with wounds,
WARWICK:
Delivered up again with peaceful words?
WARWICK:
Mort Dieu!
YORK:
For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
YORK:
That dims the honour of this warlike isle!
YORK:
France should have torn and rent my very heart,
YORK:
Before I would have yielded to this league.
YORK:
I never read but England's kings have had
YORK:
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
YORK:
And our King Henry gives away his own,
YORK:
To match with her that brings no vantages.
GLOUCESTER:
A proper jest, and never heard before,
GLOUCESTER:
That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
GLOUCESTER:
For costs and charges in transporting her!
GLOUCESTER:
She should have stayed in France and starved
GLOUCESTER:
in France, Before--
CARDINAL:
My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot
CARDINAL:
It was the pleasure of my lord the King.
GLOUCESTER:
My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind,
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
GLOUCESTER:
But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.
GLOUCESTER:
Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
GLOUCESTER:
I see thy fury: if I longer stay,
GLOUCESTER:
We shall begin our ancient bickerings.
GLOUCESTER:
Lordings, farewell, and say, when I am gone,
GLOUCESTER:
I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
CARDINAL:
So, there goes our protector in a rage.
CARDINAL:
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,
CARDINAL:
Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
CARDINAL:
And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.
CARDINAL:
Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,
CARDINAL:
And heir apparent to the English crown
CARDINAL:
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,
CARDINAL:
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
CARDINAL:
There's reason he should be displeased at it.
CARDINAL:
Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words
CARDINAL:
Bewitch your hearts, be wise and circumspect.
CARDINAL:
What though the common people favour him,
CARDINAL:
Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of
CARDINAL:
Gloucester,'
CARDINAL:
Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
CARDINAL:
'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'
CARDINAL:
With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
CARDINAL:
I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
CARDINAL:
He will be found a dangerous protector.
BUCKINGHAM:
Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,
BUCKINGHAM:
He being of age to govern of himself?
BUCKINGHAM:
Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,
BUCKINGHAM:
And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
BUCKINGHAM:
We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
CARDINAL:
This weighty business will not brook delay
CARDINAL:
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
CARDINAL:
Exit
SOMERSET:
Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
SOMERSET:
And greatness of his place be grief to us,
SOMERSET:
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
SOMERSET:
His insolence is more intolerable
SOMERSET:
Than all the princes in the land beside
SOMERSET:
If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.
BUCKINGHAM:
Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,
BUCKINGHAM:
Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET
SALISBURY:
Pride went before, ambition follows him.
SALISBURY:
While these do labour for their own preferment,
SALISBURY:
Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
SALISBURY:
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
SALISBURY:
Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
SALISBURY:
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,
SALISBURY:
More like a soldier than a man o' the church,
SALISBURY:
As stout and proud as he were lord of all,
SALISBURY:
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
SALISBURY:
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
SALISBURY:
Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,
SALISBURY:
Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,
SALISBURY:
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,
SALISBURY:
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey
SALISBURY:
And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,
SALISBURY:
In bringing them to civil discipline,
SALISBURY:
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,
SALISBURY:
When thou wert regent for our sovereign,
SALISBURY:
Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people
SALISBURY:
Join we together, for the public good,
SALISBURY:
In what we can, to bridle and suppress
SALISBURY:
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,
SALISBURY:
With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition,
SALISBURY:
And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,
SALISBURY:
While they do tend the profit of the land.
WARWICK:
So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,
WARWICK:
And common profit of his country!
YORK:
[Aside]  And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.
SALISBURY:
Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.
WARWICK:
Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost,
WARWICK:
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
WARWICK:
And would have kept so long as breath did last!
WARWICK:
Main chance, father, you meant, but I meant Maine,
WARWICK:
Which I will win from France, or else be slain,
WARWICK:
Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY
YORK:
Anjou and Maine are given to the French,
YORK:
Paris is lost, the state of Normandy
YORK:
Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone
YORK:
Suffolk concluded on the articles,
YORK:
The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased
YORK:
To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
YORK:
I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
YORK:
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
YORK:
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
YORK:
And purchase friends and give to courtezans,
YORK:
Still revelling like lords till all be gone,
YORK:
While as the silly owner of the goods
YORK:
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
YORK:
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,
YORK:
While all is shared and all is borne away,
YORK:
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own
YORK:
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,
YORK:
While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
YORK:
Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland
YORK:
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
YORK:
As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd
YORK:
Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
YORK:
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
YORK:
Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
YORK:
Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
YORK:
A day will come when York shall claim his own,
YORK:
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
YORK:
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
YORK:
And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
YORK:
For that's the golden mark I seek to hit
YORK:
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,
YORK:
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
YORK:
Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
YORK:
Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.
YORK:
Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve
YORK:
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
YORK:
To pry into the secrets of the state,
YORK:
Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
YORK:
With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
YORK:
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars
YORK:
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
YORK:
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed,
YORK:
And in my standard bear the arms of York
YORK:
To grapple with the house of Lancaster,
YORK:
And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,
YORK:
Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.
YORK:
Exit
YORK:
SCENE II. GLOUCESTER'S house.
YORK:
Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS
DUCHESS:
Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,
DUCHESS:
Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?
DUCHESS:
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,
DUCHESS:
As frowning at the favours of the world?
DUCHESS:
Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,
DUCHESS:
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
DUCHESS:
What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,
DUCHESS:
Enchased with all the honours of the world?
DUCHESS:
If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,
DUCHESS:
Until thy head be circled with the same.
DUCHESS:
Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.
DUCHESS:
What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine
DUCHESS:
And, having both together heaved it up,
DUCHESS:
We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,
DUCHESS:
And never more abase our sight so low
DUCHESS:
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.
GLOUCESTER:
O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
GLOUCESTER:
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.
GLOUCESTER:
And may that thought, when I imagine ill
GLOUCESTER:
Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,
GLOUCESTER:
Be my last breathing in this mortal world!
GLOUCESTER:
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
DUCHESS:
What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it
DUCHESS:
With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
GLOUCESTER:
Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
GLOUCESTER:
Was broke in twain, by whom I have forgot,
GLOUCESTER:
But, as I think, it was by the cardinal,
GLOUCESTER:
And on the pieces of the broken wand
GLOUCESTER:
Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,
GLOUCESTER:
And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.
GLOUCESTER:
This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.
DUCHESS:
Tut, this was nothing but an argument
DUCHESS:
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
DUCHESS:
Shall lose his head for his presumption.
DUCHESS:
But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke
DUCHESS:
Methought I sat in seat of majesty
DUCHESS:
In the cathedral church of Westminster,
DUCHESS:
And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd,
DUCHESS:
Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me
DUCHESS:
And on my head did set the diadem.
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright
GLOUCESTER:
Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,
GLOUCESTER:
Art thou not second woman in the realm,
GLOUCESTER:
And the protector's wife, beloved of him?
GLOUCESTER:
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,
GLOUCESTER:
Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
GLOUCESTER:
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,
GLOUCESTER:
To tumble down thy husband and thyself
GLOUCESTER:
From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
GLOUCESTER:
Away from me, and let me hear no more!
DUCHESS:
What, what, my lord! are you so choleric
DUCHESS:
With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?
DUCHESS:
Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,
DUCHESS:
And not be cheque'd.
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, be not angry, I am pleased again.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter Messenger
Messenger:
My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure
Messenger:
You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,
Messenger:
Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.
GLOUCESTER:
I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?
DUCHESS:
Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.
DUCHESS:
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger
DUCHESS:
Follow I must, I cannot go before,
DUCHESS:
While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
DUCHESS:
Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,
DUCHESS:
I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
DUCHESS:
And smooth my way upon their headless necks,
DUCHESS:
And, being a woman, I will not be slack
DUCHESS:
To play my part in Fortune's pageant.
DUCHESS:
Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,
DUCHESS:
We are alone, here's none but thee and I.
DUCHESS:
Enter HUME
HUME:
Jesus preserve your royal majesty!
DUCHESS:
What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.
HUME:
But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,
HUME:
Your grace's title shall be multiplied.
DUCHESS:
What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd
DUCHESS:
With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,
DUCHESS:
With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?
DUCHESS:
And will they undertake to do me good?
HUME:
This they have promised, to show your highness
HUME:
A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,
HUME:
That shall make answer to such questions
HUME:
As by your grace shall be propounded him.
DUCHESS:
It is enough, I'll think upon the questions
DUCHESS:
When from St. Alban's we do make return,
DUCHESS:
We'll see these things effected to the full.
DUCHESS:
Here, Hume, take this reward, make merry, man,
DUCHESS:
With thy confederates in this weighty cause.
DUCHESS:
Exit
HUME:
Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold,
HUME:
Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!
HUME:
Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum
HUME:
The business asketh silent secrecy.
HUME:
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
HUME:
Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.
HUME:
Yet have I gold flies from another coast,
HUME:
I dare not say, from the rich cardinal
HUME:
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,
HUME:
Yet I do find it so, for to be plain,
HUME:
They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,
HUME:
Have hired me to undermine the duchess
HUME:
And buz these conjurations in her brain.
HUME:
They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker,'
HUME:
Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.
HUME:
Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
HUME:
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
HUME:
Well, so it stands, and thus, I fear, at last
HUME:
Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,
HUME:
And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall
HUME:
Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.
HUME:
Exit
HUME:
SCENE III. The palace.
HUME:
Enter three or four Petitioners, PETER, the Armourer's man, being one
First Petitioner:
My masters, let's stand close: my lord protector
First Petitioner:
will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver
First Petitioner:
our supplications in the quill.
Second Petitioner:
Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man!
Second Petitioner:
Jesu bless him!
Second Petitioner:
Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN MARGARET
PETER:
Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him.
PETER:
I'll be the first, sure.
Second Petitioner:
Come back, fool, this is the Duke of Suffolk, and
Second Petitioner:
not my lord protector.
SUFFOLK:
How now, fellow! would'st anything with me?
First Petitioner:
I pray, my lord, pardon me, I took ye for my lord
First Petitioner:
protector.
QUEEN MARGARET:
[Reading]  'To my Lord Protector!' Are your
QUEEN MARGARET:
supplications to his lordship? Let me see them
QUEEN MARGARET:
what is thine?
First Petitioner:
Mine is, an't please your grace, against John
First Petitioner:
Goodman, my lord cardinal's man, for keeping my
First Petitioner:
house, and lands, and wife and all, from me.
SUFFOLK:
Thy wife, too! that's some wrong, indeed. What's
SUFFOLK:
yours? What's here!
SUFFOLK:
Reads
SUFFOLK:
'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the
SUFFOLK:
commons of Melford.' How now, sir knave!
Second Petitioner:
Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.
PETER:
[Giving his petition]  Against my master, Thomas
PETER:
Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful
PETER:
heir to the crown.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was
QUEEN MARGARET:
rightful heir to the crown?
PETER:
That my master was? no, forsooth: my master said
PETER:
that he was, and that the king was an usurper.
SUFFOLK:
Who is there?
SUFFOLK:
Enter Servant
SUFFOLK:
Take this fellow in, and send for
SUFFOLK:
his master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hear
SUFFOLK:
more of your matter before the King.
SUFFOLK:
Exit Servant with PETER
QUEEN MARGARET:
And as for you, that love to be protected
QUEEN MARGARET:
Under the wings of our protector's grace,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Tears the supplication
QUEEN MARGARET:
Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.
ALL:
Come, let's be gone.
ALL:
Exeunt
QUEEN MARGARET:
My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Is this the fashion in the court of England?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Is this the government of Britain's isle,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And this the royalty of Albion's king?
QUEEN MARGARET:
What shall King Henry be a pupil still
QUEEN MARGARET:
Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Am I a queen in title and in style,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And must be made a subject to a duke?
QUEEN MARGARET:
I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
QUEEN MARGARET:
And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I thought King Henry had resembled thee
QUEEN MARGARET:
In courage, courtship and proportion
QUEEN MARGARET:
But all his mind is bent to holiness,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To number Ave-Maries on his beads,
QUEEN MARGARET:
His champions are the prophets and apostles,
QUEEN MARGARET:
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,
QUEEN MARGARET:
His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
QUEEN MARGARET:
Are brazen images of canonized saints.
QUEEN MARGARET:
I would the college of the cardinals
QUEEN MARGARET:
Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And set the triple crown upon his head
QUEEN MARGARET:
That were a state fit for his holiness.
SUFFOLK:
Madam, be patient: as I was cause
SUFFOLK:
Your highness came to England, so will I
SUFFOLK:
In England work your grace's full content.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And grumbling York: and not the least of these
QUEEN MARGARET:
But can do more in England than the king.
SUFFOLK:
And he of these that can do most of all
SUFFOLK:
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils
SUFFOLK:
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Not all these lords do vex me half so much
QUEEN MARGARET:
As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.
QUEEN MARGARET:
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,
QUEEN MARGARET:
More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife
QUEEN MARGARET:
Strangers in court do take her for the queen
QUEEN MARGARET:
She bears a duke's revenues on her back,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And in her heart she scorns our poverty
QUEEN MARGARET:
Shall I not live to be avenged on her?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,
QUEEN MARGARET:
She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The very train of her worst wearing gown
QUEEN MARGARET:
Was better worth than all my father's lands,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.
SUFFOLK:
Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,
SUFFOLK:
And placed a quire of such enticing birds,
SUFFOLK:
That she will light to listen to the lays,
SUFFOLK:
And never mount to trouble you again.
SUFFOLK:
So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me,
SUFFOLK:
For I am bold to counsel you in this.
SUFFOLK:
Although we fancy not the cardinal,
SUFFOLK:
Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
SUFFOLK:
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
SUFFOLK:
As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
SUFFOLK:
Will make but little for his benefit.
SUFFOLK:
So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
SUFFOLK:
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
SUFFOLK:
Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER,  CARDINAL, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and the DUCHESS
KING HENRY VI:
For my part, noble lords, I care not which,
KING HENRY VI:
Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.
YORK:
If York have ill demean'd himself in France,
YORK:
Then let him be denay'd the regentship.
SOMERSET:
If Somerset be unworthy of the place,
SOMERSET:
Let York be regent, I will yield to him.
WARWICK:
Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,
WARWICK:
Dispute not that: York is the worthier.
CARDINAL:
Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.
WARWICK:
The cardinal's not my better in the field.
BUCKINGHAM:
All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.
WARWICK:
Warwick may live to be the best of all.
SALISBURY:
Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,
SALISBURY:
Why Somerset should be preferred in this.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.
GLOUCESTER:
Madam, the king is old enough himself
GLOUCESTER:
To give his censure: these are no women's matters.
QUEEN MARGARET:
If he be old enough, what needs your grace
QUEEN MARGARET:
To be protector of his excellence?
GLOUCESTER:
Madam, I am protector of the realm,
GLOUCESTER:
And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.
SUFFOLK:
Resign it then and leave thine insolence.
SUFFOLK:
Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
SUFFOLK:
The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck,
SUFFOLK:
The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas,
SUFFOLK:
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
SUFFOLK:
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.
CARDINAL:
The commons hast thou rack'd, the clergy's bags
CARDINAL:
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.
SOMERSET:
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
SOMERSET:
Have cost a mass of public treasury.
BUCKINGHAM:
Thy cruelty in execution
BUCKINGHAM:
Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,
BUCKINGHAM:
And left thee to the mercy of the law.
QUEEN MARGARET:
They sale of offices and towns in France,
QUEEN MARGARET:
If they were known, as the suspect is great,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan
QUEEN MARGARET:
Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?
QUEEN MARGARET:
She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear
QUEEN MARGARET:
I cry you mercy, madam, was it you?
DUCHESS:
Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman
DUCHESS:
Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
DUCHESS:
I'd set my ten commandments in your face.
KING HENRY VI:
Sweet aunt, be quiet, 'twas against her will.
DUCHESS:
Against her will! good king, look to't in time,
DUCHESS:
She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby
DUCHESS:
Though in this place most master wear no breeches,
DUCHESS:
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.
DUCHESS:
Exit
BUCKINGHAM:
Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
BUCKINGHAM:
And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds
BUCKINGHAM:
She's tickled now, her fume needs no spurs,
BUCKINGHAM:
She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exit
BUCKINGHAM:
Re-enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
Now, lords, my choler being over-blown
GLOUCESTER:
With walking once about the quadrangle,
GLOUCESTER:
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.
GLOUCESTER:
As for your spiteful false objections,
GLOUCESTER:
Prove them, and I lie open to the law
GLOUCESTER:
But God in mercy so deal with my soul,
GLOUCESTER:
As I in duty love my king and country!
GLOUCESTER:
But, to the matter that we have in hand
GLOUCESTER:
I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man
GLOUCESTER:
To be your regent in the realm of France.
SUFFOLK:
Before we make election, give me leave
SUFFOLK:
To show some reason, of no little force,
SUFFOLK:
That York is most unmeet of any man.
YORK:
I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet
YORK:
First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride,
YORK:
Next, if I be appointed for the place,
YORK:
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,
YORK:
Without discharge, money, or furniture,
YORK:
Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands
YORK:
Last time, I danced attendance on his will
YORK:
Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.
WARWICK:
That can I witness, and a fouler fact
WARWICK:
Did never traitor in the land commit.
SUFFOLK:
Peace, headstrong Warwick!
WARWICK:
Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
WARWICK:
Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guarded
SUFFOLK:
Because here is a man accused of treason
SUFFOLK:
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!
YORK:
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
KING HENRY VI:
What mean'st thou, Suffolk, tell me, what are these?
SUFFOLK:
Please it your majesty, this is the man
SUFFOLK:
That doth accuse his master of high treason
SUFFOLK:
His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,
SUFFOLK:
Was rightful heir unto the English crown
SUFFOLK:
And that your majesty was a usurper.
KING HENRY VI:
Say, man, were these thy words?
HORNER:
An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor
HORNER:
thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am
HORNER:
falsely accused by the villain.
PETER:
By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to
PETER:
me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my
PETER:
Lord of York's armour.
YORK:
Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
YORK:
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.
YORK:
I do beseech your royal majesty,
YORK:
Let him have all the rigor of the law.
HORNER:
Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.
HORNER:
My accuser is my 'prentice, and when I did correct
HORNER:
him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his
HORNER:
knees he would be even with me: I have good
HORNER:
witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,
HORNER:
do not cast away an honest man for a villain's
HORNER:
accusation.
KING HENRY VI:
Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
GLOUCESTER:
This doom, my lord, if I may judge
GLOUCESTER:
Let Somerset be regent over the French,
GLOUCESTER:
Because in York this breeds suspicion
GLOUCESTER:
And let these have a day appointed them
GLOUCESTER:
For single combat in convenient place,
GLOUCESTER:
For he hath witness of his servant's malice
GLOUCESTER:
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.
SOMERSET:
I humbly thank your royal majesty.
HORNER:
And I accept the combat willingly.
PETER:
Alas, my lord, I cannot fight, for God's sake, pity
PETER:
my case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. O
PETER:
Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to
PETER:
fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!
GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.
KING HENRY VI:
Away with them to prison, and the day of combat
KING HENRY VI:
shall be the last of the next month. Come,
KING HENRY VI:
Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.
KING HENRY VI:
Flourish. Exeunt
KING HENRY VI:
SCENE IV. GLOUCESTER's garden.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter MARGARET JOURDAIN, HUME, SOUTHWELL, and BOLINGBROKE
HUME:
Come, my masters, the duchess, I tell you, expects
HUME:
performance of your promises.
BOLINGBROKE:
Master Hume, we are therefore provided: will her
BOLINGBROKE:
ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?
HUME:
Ay, what else? fear you not her courage.
BOLINGBROKE:
I have heard her reported to be a woman of an
BOLINGBROKE:
invincible spirit: but it shall be convenient,
BOLINGBROKE:
Master Hume, that you be by her aloft, while we be
BOLINGBROKE:
busy below, and so, I pray you, go, in God's name,
BOLINGBROKE:
and leave us.
BOLINGBROKE:
Exit HUME
BOLINGBROKE:
Mother Jourdain, be you
BOLINGBROKE:
prostrate and grovel on the earth, John Southwell,
BOLINGBROKE:
read you, and let us to our work.
BOLINGBROKE:
Enter the DUCHESS aloft, HUME following
DUCHESS:
Well said, my masters, and welcome all. To this
DUCHESS:
gear the sooner the better.
BOLINGBROKE:
Patience, good lady, wizards know their times
BOLINGBROKE:
Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
BOLINGBROKE:
The time of night when Troy was set on fire,
BOLINGBROKE:
The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
BOLINGBROKE:
And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,
BOLINGBROKE:
That time best fits the work we have in hand.
BOLINGBROKE:
Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,
BOLINGBROKE:
We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
BOLINGBROKE:
Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the  circle, BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWELL reads, Conjuro te, and c. It thunders and lightens terribly, then the Spirit riseth
Spirit:
Adsum.
MARGARET JOURDAIN:
Asmath,
MARGARET JOURDAIN:
By the eternal God, whose name and power
MARGARET JOURDAIN:
Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask,
MARGARET JOURDAIN:
For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.
Spirit:
Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!
BOLINGBROKE:
'First of the king: what shall of him become?'
BOLINGBROKE:
Reading out of a paper
Spirit:
The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose,
Spirit:
But him outlive, and die a violent death.
Spirit:
As the Spirit speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer
BOLINGBROKE:
'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
Spirit:
By water shall he die, and take his end.
BOLINGBROKE:
'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
Spirit:
Let him shun castles,
Spirit:
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
Spirit:
Than where castles mounted stand.
Spirit:
Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
BOLINGBROKE:
Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
BOLINGBROKE:
False fiend, avoid!
BOLINGBROKE:
Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit
BOLINGBROKE:
Enter YORK and BUCKINGHAM with their Guard and break in
YORK:
Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
YORK:
Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.
YORK:
What, madam, are you there? the king and commonweal
YORK:
Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains
YORK:
My lord protector will, I doubt it not,
YORK:
See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
DUCHESS:
Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
DUCHESS:
Injurious duke, that threatest where's no cause.
BUCKINGHAM:
True, madam, none at all: what call you this?
BUCKINGHAM:
Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.
BUCKINGHAM:
And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.
BUCKINGHAM:
Stafford, take her to thee.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exeunt above DUCHESS and HUME, guarded
BUCKINGHAM:
We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
BUCKINGHAM:
All, away!
BUCKINGHAM:
Exeunt guard with MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL,  and c
YORK:
Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well
YORK:
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
YORK:
Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
YORK:
What have we here?
YORK:
Reads
YORK:
'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose,
YORK:
But him outlive, and die a violent death.'
YORK:
Why, this is just
YORK:
'Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere posse.'
YORK:
Well, to the rest
YORK:
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?
YORK:
By water shall he die, and take his end.
YORK:
What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
YORK:
Let him shun castles,
YORK:
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
YORK:
Than where castles mounted stand.'
YORK:
Come, come, my lords,
YORK:
These oracles are hardly attain'd,
YORK:
And hardly understood.
YORK:
The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,
YORK:
With him the husband of this lovely lady
YORK:
Thither go these news, as fast as horse can
YORK:
carry them
YORK:
A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.
BUCKINGHAM:
Your grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
BUCKINGHAM:
To be the post, in hope of his reward.
YORK:
At your pleasure, my good lord. Who's within
YORK:
there, ho!
YORK:
Enter a Servingman
YORK:
Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
YORK:
To sup with me to-morrow night. Away!
YORK:
Exeunt
YORK:
ACT II
YORK:
SCENE I. Saint Alban's.
YORK:
Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, GLOUCESTER, CARDINAL, and SUFFOLK, with Falconers halloing
QUEEN MARGARET:
Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I saw not better sport these seven years' day
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.
KING HENRY VI:
But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
KING HENRY VI:
And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
KING HENRY VI:
To see how God in all his creatures works!
KING HENRY VI:
Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.
SUFFOLK:
No marvel, an it like your majesty,
SUFFOLK:
My lord protector's hawks do tower so well,
SUFFOLK:
They know their master loves to be aloft,
SUFFOLK:
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
GLOUCESTER:
My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind
GLOUCESTER:
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.
CARDINAL:
I thought as much, he would be above the clouds.
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?
GLOUCESTER:
Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?
KING HENRY VI:
The treasury of everlasting joy.
CARDINAL:
Thy heaven is on earth, thine eyes and thoughts
CARDINAL:
Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart,
CARDINAL:
Pernicious protector, dangerous peer,
CARDINAL:
That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!
GLOUCESTER:
What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?
GLOUCESTER:
Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?
GLOUCESTER:
Churchmen so hot? good uncle, hide such malice,
GLOUCESTER:
With such holiness can you do it?
SUFFOLK:
No malice, sir, no more than well becomes
SUFFOLK:
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.
GLOUCESTER:
As who, my lord?
SUFFOLK:
Why, as you, my lord,
SUFFOLK:
An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And thy ambition, Gloucester.
KING HENRY VI:
I prithee, peace, good queen,
KING HENRY VI:
And whet not on these furious peers,
KING HENRY VI:
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.
CARDINAL:
Let me be blessed for the peace I make,
CARDINAL:
Against this proud protector, with my sword!
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CARDINAL]  Faith, holy uncle, would
GLOUCESTER:
'twere come to that!
CARDINAL:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Marry, when thou darest.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CARDINAL]  Make up no factious
GLOUCESTER:
numbers for the matter,
GLOUCESTER:
In thine own person answer thy abuse.
CARDINAL:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Ay, where thou darest
CARDINAL:
not peep: an if thou darest,
CARDINAL:
This evening, on the east side of the grove.
KING HENRY VI:
How now, my lords!
CARDINAL:
Believe me, cousin Gloucester,
CARDINAL:
Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,
CARDINAL:
We had had more sport.
CARDINAL:
Aside to GLOUCESTER
CARDINAL:
Come with thy two-hand sword.
GLOUCESTER:
True, uncle.
CARDINAL:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Are ye advised? the
CARDINAL:
east side of the grove?
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CARDINAL]  Cardinal, I am with you.
KING HENRY VI:
Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!
GLOUCESTER:
Talking of hawking, nothing else, my lord.
GLOUCESTER:
Aside to CARDINAL
GLOUCESTER:
Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,
GLOUCESTER:
Or all my fence shall fail.
CARDINAL:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Medice, teipsum--
CARDINAL:
Protector, see to't well, protect yourself.
KING HENRY VI:
The winds grow high, so do your stomachs, lords.
KING HENRY VI:
How irksome is this music to my heart!
KING HENRY VI:
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
KING HENRY VI:
I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!'
GLOUCESTER:
What means this noise?
GLOUCESTER:
Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?
Townsman:
A miracle! a miracle!
SUFFOLK:
Come to the king and tell him what miracle.
Townsman:
Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,
Townsman:
Within this half-hour, hath received his sight,
Townsman:
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
KING HENRY VI:
Now, God be praised, that to believing souls
KING HENRY VI:
Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!
KING HENRY VI:
Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his  brethren, bearing SIMPCOX, between two in a chair, SIMPCOX's Wife following
CARDINAL:
Here comes the townsmen on procession,
CARDINAL:
To present your highness with the man.
KING HENRY VI:
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
KING HENRY VI:
Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.
GLOUCESTER:
Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king,
GLOUCESTER:
His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.
KING HENRY VI:
Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,
KING HENRY VI:
That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
KING HENRY VI:
What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?
SIMPCOX:
Born blind, an't please your grace.
Wife:
Ay, indeed, was he.
SUFFOLK:
What woman is this?
Wife:
His wife, an't like your worship.
GLOUCESTER:
Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have
GLOUCESTER:
better told.
KING HENRY VI:
Where wert thou born?
SIMPCOX:
At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.
KING HENRY VI:
Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee
KING HENRY VI:
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,
KING HENRY VI:
But still remember what the Lord hath done.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?
SIMPCOX:
God knows, of pure devotion, being call'd
SIMPCOX:
A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,
SIMPCOX:
By good Saint Alban, who said, 'Simpcox, come,
SIMPCOX:
Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'
Wife:
Most true, forsooth, and many time and oft
Wife:
Myself have heard a voice to call him so.
CARDINAL:
What, art thou lame?
SIMPCOX:
Ay, God Almighty help me!
SUFFOLK:
How camest thou so?
SIMPCOX:
A fall off of a tree.
Wife:
A plum-tree, master.
GLOUCESTER:
How long hast thou been blind?
SIMPCOX:
Born so, master.
GLOUCESTER:
What, and wouldst climb a tree?
SIMPCOX:
But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
Wife:
Too true, and bought his climbing very dear.
GLOUCESTER:
Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst
GLOUCESTER:
venture so.
SIMPCOX:
Alas,  good master, my wife desired some damsons,
SIMPCOX:
And made me climb, with danger of my life.
GLOUCESTER:
A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
GLOUCESTER:
Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them
GLOUCESTER:
In my opinion yet thou seest not well.
SIMPCOX:
Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and
SIMPCOX:
Saint Alban.
GLOUCESTER:
Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?
SIMPCOX:
Red, master, red as blood.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?
SIMPCOX:
Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.
KING HENRY VI:
Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?
SUFFOLK:
And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
GLOUCESTER:
But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.
Wife:
Never, before this day, in all his life.
GLOUCESTER:
Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?
SIMPCOX:
Alas, master, I know not.
GLOUCESTER:
What's his name?
SIMPCOX:
I know not.
GLOUCESTER:
Nor his?
SIMPCOX:
No, indeed, master.
GLOUCESTER:
What's thine own name?
SIMPCOX:
Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
GLOUCESTER:
Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in
GLOUCESTER:
Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou
GLOUCESTER:
mightest as well have known all our names as thus to
GLOUCESTER:
name the several colours we do wear. Sight may
GLOUCESTER:
distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them
GLOUCESTER:
all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here
GLOUCESTER:
hath done a miracle, and would ye not think his
GLOUCESTER:
cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple
GLOUCESTER:
to his legs again?
SIMPCOX:
O master, that you could!
GLOUCESTER:
My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in
GLOUCESTER:
your town, and things called whips?
Mayor:
Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.
GLOUCESTER:
Then send for one presently.
Mayor:
Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.
Mayor:
Exit an Attendant
GLOUCESTER:
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,
GLOUCESTER:
if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me
GLOUCESTER:
over this stool and run away.
SIMPCOX:
Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone
SIMPCOX:
You go about to torture me in vain.
SIMPCOX:
Enter a Beadle with whips
GLOUCESTER:
Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah
GLOUCESTER:
beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.
Beadle:
I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah, off with your
Beadle:
doublet quickly.
SIMPCOX:
Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.
SIMPCOX:
After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs away, and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!'
KING HENRY VI:
O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?
QUEEN MARGARET:
It made me laugh to see the villain run.
GLOUCESTER:
Follow the knave, and take this drab away.
Wife:
Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.
GLOUCESTER:
Let them be whipped through every market-town, till
GLOUCESTER:
they come to Berwick, from whence they came.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor,  and c
CARDINAL:
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.
SUFFOLK:
True, made the lame to leap and fly away.
GLOUCESTER:
But you have done more miracles than I,
GLOUCESTER:
You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter BUCKINGHAM
KING HENRY VI:
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM:
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.
BUCKINGHAM:
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
BUCKINGHAM:
Under the countenance and confederacy
BUCKINGHAM:
Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,
BUCKINGHAM:
The ringleader and head of all this rout,
BUCKINGHAM:
Have practised dangerously against your state,
BUCKINGHAM:
Dealing with witches and with conjurers
BUCKINGHAM:
Whom we have apprehended in the fact,
BUCKINGHAM:
Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,
BUCKINGHAM:
Demanding of King Henry's life and death,
BUCKINGHAM:
And other of your highness' privy-council,
BUCKINGHAM:
As more at large your grace shall understand.
CARDINAL:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  And so, my lord protector,
CARDINAL:
by this means
CARDINAL:
Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
CARDINAL:
This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge,
CARDINAL:
'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
GLOUCESTER:
Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart
GLOUCESTER:
Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers,
GLOUCESTER:
And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee,
GLOUCESTER:
Or to the meanest groom.
KING HENRY VI:
O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
KING HENRY VI:
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.
GLOUCESTER:
Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,
GLOUCESTER:
How I have loved my king and commonweal
GLOUCESTER:
And, for my wife, I know not how it stands,
GLOUCESTER:
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard
GLOUCESTER:
Noble she is, but if she have forgot
GLOUCESTER:
Honour and virtue and conversed with such
GLOUCESTER:
As, like to pitch, defile nobility,
GLOUCESTER:
I banish her my bed and company
GLOUCESTER:
And give her as a prey to law and shame,
GLOUCESTER:
That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.
KING HENRY VI:
Well, for this night we will repose us here
KING HENRY VI:
To-morrow toward London back again,
KING HENRY VI:
To look into this business thoroughly
KING HENRY VI:
And call these foul offenders to their answers
KING HENRY VI:
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,
KING HENRY VI:
Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.
KING HENRY VI:
Flourish. Exeunt
KING HENRY VI:
SCENE II. London. YORK'S garden.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK
YORK:
Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
YORK:
Our simple supper ended, give me leave
YORK:
In this close walk to satisfy myself,
YORK:
In craving your opinion of my title,
YORK:
Which is infallible, to England's crown.
SALISBURY:
My lord, I long to hear it at full.
WARWICK:
Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,
WARWICK:
The Nevils are thy subjects to command.
YORK:
Then thus
YORK:
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons
YORK:
The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales,
YORK:
The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,
YORK:
Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
YORK:
Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster,
YORK:
The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
YORK:
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester,
YORK:
William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
YORK:
Edward the Black Prince died before his father
YORK:
And left behind him Richard, his only son,
YORK:
Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king,
YORK:
Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
YORK:
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
YORK:
Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
YORK:
Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,
YORK:
Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
YORK:
And him to Pomfret, where, as all you know,
YORK:
Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
WARWICK:
Father, the duke hath told the truth
WARWICK:
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
YORK:
Which now they hold by force and not by right,
YORK:
For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
YORK:
The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
SALISBURY:
But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
YORK:
The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
YORK:
I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,
YORK:
Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March
YORK:
Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March,
YORK:
Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.
SALISBURY:
This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
SALISBURY:
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,
SALISBURY:
And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
SALISBURY:
Who kept him in captivity till he died.
SALISBURY:
But to the rest.
YORK:
His eldest sister, Anne,
YORK:
My mother, being heir unto the crown
YORK:
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was son
YORK:
To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
YORK:
By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
YORK:
To Roger Earl of March, who was the son
YORK:
Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,
YORK:
Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence
YORK:
So, if the issue of the elder son
YORK:
Succeed before the younger, I am king.
WARWICK:
What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
WARWICK:
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
WARWICK:
The fourth son, York claims it from the third.
WARWICK:
Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign
WARWICK:
It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee
WARWICK:
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
WARWICK:
Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,
WARWICK:
And in this private plot be we the first
WARWICK:
That shall salute our rightful sovereign
WARWICK:
With honour of his birthright to the crown.
BOTH:
Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!
YORK:
We thank you, lords. But I am not your king
YORK:
Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
YORK:
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster,
YORK:
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
YORK:
But with advice and silent secrecy.
YORK:
Do you as I do in these dangerous days
YORK:
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
YORK:
At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
YORK:
At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
YORK:
Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,
YORK:
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey
YORK:
'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that
YORK:
Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.
SALISBURY:
My lord, break we off, we know your mind at full.
WARWICK:
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
WARWICK:
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
YORK:
And, Nevil, this I do assure myself
YORK:
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
YORK:
The greatest man in England but the king.
YORK:
Exeunt
YORK:
SCENE III. A hall of justice.
YORK:
Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN  MARGARET, GLOUCESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, and SALISBURY,  the DUCHESS, MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL, HUME, and BOLINGBROKE, under guard
KING HENRY VI:
Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife
KING HENRY VI:
In sight of God and us, your guilt is great
KING HENRY VI:
Receive the sentence of the law for sins
KING HENRY VI:
Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.
KING HENRY VI:
You four, from hence to prison back again,
KING HENRY VI:
From thence unto the place of execution
KING HENRY VI:
The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,
KING HENRY VI:
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
KING HENRY VI:
You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
KING HENRY VI:
Despoiled of your honour in your life,
KING HENRY VI:
Shall, after three days' open penance done,
KING HENRY VI:
Live in your country here in banishment,
KING HENRY VI:
With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.
DUCHESS:
Welcome is banishment, welcome were my death.
GLOUCESTER:
Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee
GLOUCESTER:
I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners, guarded
GLOUCESTER:
Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.
GLOUCESTER:
Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age
GLOUCESTER:
Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!
GLOUCESTER:
I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go,
GLOUCESTER:
Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.
KING HENRY VI:
Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,
KING HENRY VI:
Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself
KING HENRY VI:
Protector be, and God shall be my hope,
KING HENRY VI:
My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet
KING HENRY VI:
And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved
KING HENRY VI:
Than when thou wert protector to thy King.
QUEEN MARGARET:
I see no reason why a king of years
QUEEN MARGARET:
Should be to be protected like a child.
QUEEN MARGARET:
God and King Henry govern England's realm.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.
GLOUCESTER:
My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff
GLOUCESTER:
As willingly do I the same resign
GLOUCESTER:
As e'er thy father Henry made it mine,
GLOUCESTER:
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
GLOUCESTER:
As others would ambitiously receive it.
GLOUCESTER:
Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,
GLOUCESTER:
May honourable peace attend thy throne!
GLOUCESTER:
Exit
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That bears so shrewd a maim, two pulls at once,
QUEEN MARGARET:
His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.
QUEEN MARGARET:
This staff of honour raught, there let it stand
QUEEN MARGARET:
Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.
SUFFOLK:
Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays,
SUFFOLK:
Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.
YORK:
Lords, let him go. Please it your majesty,
YORK:
This is the day appointed for the combat,
YORK:
And ready are the appellant and defendant,
YORK:
The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,
YORK:
So please your highness to behold the fight.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, good my lord, for purposely therefore
QUEEN MARGARET:
Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
KING HENRY VI:
O God's name, see the lists and all things fit
KING HENRY VI:
Here let them end it, and God defend the right!
YORK:
I never saw a fellow worse bested,
YORK:
Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant,
YORK:
The servant of this armourer, my lords.
YORK:
Enter at one door, HORNER, the Armourer, and his  Neighbours, drinking to him so much that he is drunk,  and he enters with a drum before him and his staff  with a sand-bag fastened to it, and at the other  door PETER, his man, with a drum and sand-bag, and 'Prentices drinking to him
First Neighbour:
Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of
First Neighbour:
sack: and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.
Second Neighbour:
And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco.
Third Neighbour:
And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour
Third Neighbour:
drink, and fear not your man.
HORNER:
Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all, and
HORNER:
a fig for Peter!
HORNER:
First 'Prentice	Here, Peter, I drink to thee: and be not afraid.
HORNER:
Second 'Prentice	Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight
HORNER:
for credit of the 'prentices.
PETER:
I thank you all: drink, and pray for me, I pray
PETER:
you, for I think I have taken my last draught in
PETER:
this world. Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee
PETER:
my apron: and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer
PETER:
and here, Tom, take all the money that I have. O
PETER:
Lord bless me! I pray God! for I am never able to
PETER:
deal with my master, he hath learnt me so much fence already.
SALISBURY:
Come, leave your drinking, and fall to blows.
SALISBURY:
Sirrah, what's thy name?
PETER:
Peter, forsooth.
SALISBURY:
Peter! what more?
PETER:
Thump.
SALISBURY:
Thump! then see thou thump thy master well.
HORNER:
Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's
HORNER:
instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an
HORNER:
honest man: and touching the Duke of York, I will
HORNER:
take my death, I never meant him any ill, nor the
HORNER:
king, nor the queen: and therefore, Peter, have at
HORNER:
thee with a downright blow!
YORK:
Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.
YORK:
Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!
YORK:
Alarum. They fight, and PETER strikes him down
HORNER:
Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.
HORNER:
Dies
YORK:
Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the
YORK:
good wine in thy master's way.
PETER:
O God, have I overcome mine enemy in this presence?
PETER:
O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!
KING HENRY VI:
Go, take hence that traitor from our sight,
KING HENRY VI:
For his death we do perceive his guilt
KING HENRY VI:
And God in justice hath revealed to us
KING HENRY VI:
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
KING HENRY VI:
Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.
KING HENRY VI:
Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.
KING HENRY VI:
Sound a flourish. Exeunt
KING HENRY VI:
SCENE IV. A street.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter GLOUCESTER and his Servingmen, in mourning cloaks
GLOUCESTER:
Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud,
GLOUCESTER:
And after summer evermore succeeds
GLOUCESTER:
Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold
GLOUCESTER:
So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.
GLOUCESTER:
Sirs, what's o'clock?
Servants:
Ten, my lord.
GLOUCESTER:
Ten is the hour that was appointed me
GLOUCESTER:
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess
GLOUCESTER:
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
GLOUCESTER:
To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.
GLOUCESTER:
Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
GLOUCESTER:
The abject people gazing on thy face,
GLOUCESTER:
With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,
GLOUCESTER:
That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels
GLOUCESTER:
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.
GLOUCESTER:
But, soft! I think she comes, and I'll prepare
GLOUCESTER:
My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper  burning in her hand, with STANLEY, the Sheriff, and Officers
Servant:
So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.
GLOUCESTER:
No, stir not, for your lives, let her pass by.
DUCHESS:
Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?
DUCHESS:
Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
DUCHESS:
See how the giddy multitude do point,
DUCHESS:
And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!
DUCHESS:
Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,
DUCHESS:
And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,
DUCHESS:
And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!
GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, gentle Nell, forget this grief.
DUCHESS:
Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!
DUCHESS:
For whilst I think I am thy married wife
DUCHESS:
And thou a prince, protector of this land,
DUCHESS:
Methinks I should not thus be led along,
DUCHESS:
Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,
DUCHESS:
And followed with a rabble that rejoice
DUCHESS:
To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
DUCHESS:
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,
DUCHESS:
And when I start, the envious people laugh
DUCHESS:
And bid me be advised how I tread.
DUCHESS:
Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
DUCHESS:
Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,
DUCHESS:
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
DUCHESS:
No, dark shall be my light and night my day,
DUCHESS:
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
DUCHESS:
Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,
DUCHESS:
And he a prince and ruler of the land
DUCHESS:
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
DUCHESS:
As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,
DUCHESS:
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
DUCHESS:
To every idle rascal follower.
DUCHESS:
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,
DUCHESS:
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
DUCHESS:
Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will,
DUCHESS:
For Suffolk, he that can do all in all
DUCHESS:
With her that hateth thee and hates us all,
DUCHESS:
And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,
DUCHESS:
Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
DUCHESS:
And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee
DUCHESS:
But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,
DUCHESS:
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
GLOUCESTER:
Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry,
GLOUCESTER:
I must offend before I be attainted,
GLOUCESTER:
And had I twenty times so many foes,
GLOUCESTER:
And each of them had twenty times their power,
GLOUCESTER:
All these could not procure me any scathe,
GLOUCESTER:
So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.
GLOUCESTER:
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
GLOUCESTER:
Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away
GLOUCESTER:
But I in danger for the breach of law.
GLOUCESTER:
Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell
GLOUCESTER:
I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience,
GLOUCESTER:
These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.
GLOUCESTER:
Enter a Herald
Herald:
I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,
Herald:
Holden at Bury the first of this next month.
GLOUCESTER:
And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
GLOUCESTER:
This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit Herald
GLOUCESTER:
My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,
GLOUCESTER:
Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.
Sheriff:
An't please your grace, here my commission stays,
Sheriff:
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
Sheriff:
To take her with him to the Isle of Man.
GLOUCESTER:
Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?
STANLEY:
So am I given in charge, may't please your grace.
GLOUCESTER:
Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
GLOUCESTER:
You use her well: the world may laugh again,
GLOUCESTER:
And I may live to do you kindness if
GLOUCESTER:
You do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!
DUCHESS:
What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!
GLOUCESTER:
Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.
GLOUCESTER:
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen
DUCHESS:
Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!
DUCHESS:
For none abides with me: my joy is death,
DUCHESS:
Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,
DUCHESS:
Because I wish'd this world's eternity.
DUCHESS:
Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence,
DUCHESS:
I care not whither, for I beg no favour,
DUCHESS:
Only convey me where thou art commanded.
STANLEY:
Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,
STANLEY:
There to be used according to your state.
DUCHESS:
That's bad enough, for I am but reproach
DUCHESS:
And shall I then be used reproachfully?
STANLEY:
Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady,
STANLEY:
According to that state you shall be used.
DUCHESS:
Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,
DUCHESS:
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.
Sheriff:
It is my office, and, madam, pardon me.
DUCHESS:
Ay, ay, farewell, thy office is discharged.
DUCHESS:
Come, Stanley, shall we go?
STANLEY:
Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
STANLEY:
And go we to attire you for our journey.
DUCHESS:
My shame will not be shifted with my sheet
DUCHESS:
No, it will hang upon my richest robes
DUCHESS:
And show itself, attire me how I can.
DUCHESS:
Go, lead the way, I long to see my prison.
DUCHESS:
Exeunt
DUCHESS:
ACT III
DUCHESS:
SCENE I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.
DUCHESS:
Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN  MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament
KING HENRY VI:
I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come
KING HENRY VI:
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
KING HENRY VI:
Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Can you not see? or will ye not observe
QUEEN MARGARET:
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
QUEEN MARGARET:
With what a majesty he bears himself,
QUEEN MARGARET:
How insolent of late he is become,
QUEEN MARGARET:
How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
QUEEN MARGARET:
We know the time since he was mild and affable,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And if we did but glance a far-off look,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Immediately he was upon his knee,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That all the court admired him for submission
QUEEN MARGARET:
But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,
QUEEN MARGARET:
When every one will give the time of day,
QUEEN MARGARET:
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Small curs are not regarded when they grin,
QUEEN MARGARET:
But great men tremble when the lion roars,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And Humphrey is no little man in England.
QUEEN MARGARET:
First note that he is near you in descent,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And should you fall, he as the next will mount.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Me seemeth then it is no policy,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
QUEEN MARGARET:
And his advantage following your decease,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That he should come about your royal person
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or be admitted to your highness' council.
QUEEN MARGARET:
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And when he please to make commotion,
QUEEN MARGARET:
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden
QUEEN MARGARET:
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
QUEEN MARGARET:
The reverent care I bear unto my lord
QUEEN MARGARET:
Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
QUEEN MARGARET:
If it be fond, call it a woman's fear,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.
QUEEN MARGARET:
My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Reprove my allegation, if you can,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or else conclude my words effectual.
SUFFOLK:
Well hath your highness seen into this duke,
SUFFOLK:
And, had I first been put to speak my mind,
SUFFOLK:
I think I should have told your grace's tale.
SUFFOLK:
The duchess, by his subornation,
SUFFOLK:
Upon my life, began her devilish practises
SUFFOLK:
Or, if he were not privy to those faults,
SUFFOLK:
Yet, by reputing of his high descent,
SUFFOLK:
As next the king he was successive heir,
SUFFOLK:
And such high vaunts of his nobility,
SUFFOLK:
Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess
SUFFOLK:
By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
SUFFOLK:
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
SUFFOLK:
And in his simple show he harbours treason.
SUFFOLK:
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
SUFFOLK:
No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man
SUFFOLK:
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
CARDINAL:
Did he not, contrary to form of law,
CARDINAL:
Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
YORK:
And did he not, in his protectorship,
YORK:
Levy great sums of money through the realm
YORK:
For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?
YORK:
By means whereof the towns each day revolted.
BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.
BUCKINGHAM:
Which time will bring to light in smooth
BUCKINGHAM:
Duke Humphrey.
KING HENRY VI:
My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
KING HENRY VI:
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,
KING HENRY VI:
Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,
KING HENRY VI:
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
KING HENRY VI:
From meaning treason to our royal person
KING HENRY VI:
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
KING HENRY VI:
The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given
KING HENRY VI:
To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For he's disposed as the hateful raven
QUEEN MARGARET:
Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Take heed, my lord, the welfare of us all
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Enter SOMERSET
SOMERSET:
All health unto my gracious sovereign!
KING HENRY VI:
Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?
SOMERSET:
That all your interest in those territories
SOMERSET:
Is utterly bereft you, all is lost.
KING HENRY VI:
Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!
YORK:
[Aside]  Cold news for me, for I had hope of France
YORK:
As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
YORK:
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
YORK:
And caterpillars eat my leaves away,
YORK:
But I will remedy this gear ere long,
YORK:
Or sell my title for a glorious grave.
YORK:
Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER:
All happiness unto my lord the king!
GLOUCESTER:
Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
SUFFOLK:
Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
SUFFOLK:
Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
SUFFOLK:
I do arrest thee of high treason here.
GLOUCESTER:
Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush
GLOUCESTER:
Nor change my countenance for this arrest
GLOUCESTER:
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
GLOUCESTER:
The purest spring is not so free from mud
GLOUCESTER:
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign
GLOUCESTER:
Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?
YORK:
'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,
YORK:
And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay,
YORK:
By means whereof his highness hath lost France.
GLOUCESTER:
Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?
GLOUCESTER:
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,
GLOUCESTER:
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
GLOUCESTER:
So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,
GLOUCESTER:
That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,
GLOUCESTER:
Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
GLOUCESTER:
Be brought against me at my trial-day!
GLOUCESTER:
No, many a pound of mine own proper store,
GLOUCESTER:
Because I would not tax the needy commons,
GLOUCESTER:
Have I disbursed to the garrisons,
GLOUCESTER:
And never ask'd for restitution.
CARDINAL:
It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.
GLOUCESTER:
I say no more than truth, so help me God!
YORK:
In your protectorship you did devise
YORK:
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,
YORK:
That England was defamed by tyranny.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was
GLOUCESTER:
protector,
GLOUCESTER:
Pity was all the fault that was in me,
GLOUCESTER:
For I should melt at an offender's tears,
GLOUCESTER:
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
GLOUCESTER:
Unless it were a bloody murderer,
GLOUCESTER:
Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,
GLOUCESTER:
I never gave them condign punishment
GLOUCESTER:
Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured
GLOUCESTER:
Above the felon or what trespass else.
SUFFOLK:
My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered
SUFFOLK:
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,
SUFFOLK:
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
SUFFOLK:
I do arrest you in his highness' name,
SUFFOLK:
And here commit you to my lord cardinal
SUFFOLK:
To keep, until your further time of trial.
KING HENRY VI:
My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
KING HENRY VI:
That you will clear yourself from all suspect
KING HENRY VI:
My conscience tells me you are innocent.
GLOUCESTER:
Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous
GLOUCESTER:
Virtue is choked with foul ambition
GLOUCESTER:
And charity chased hence by rancour's hand,
GLOUCESTER:
Foul subornation is predominant
GLOUCESTER:
And equity exiled your highness' land.
GLOUCESTER:
I know their complot is to have my life,
GLOUCESTER:
And if my death might make this island happy,
GLOUCESTER:
And prove the period of their tyranny,
GLOUCESTER:
I would expend it with all willingness
GLOUCESTER:
But mine is made the prologue to their play,
GLOUCESTER:
For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
GLOUCESTER:
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
GLOUCESTER:
Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,
GLOUCESTER:
And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate,
GLOUCESTER:
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
GLOUCESTER:
The envious load that lies upon his heart,
GLOUCESTER:
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
GLOUCESTER:
Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,
GLOUCESTER:
By false accuse doth level at my life
GLOUCESTER:
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
GLOUCESTER:
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
GLOUCESTER:
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
GLOUCESTER:
My liefest liege to be mine enemy
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, all you have laid your heads together--
GLOUCESTER:
Myself had notice of your conventicles--
GLOUCESTER:
And all to make away my guiltless life.
GLOUCESTER:
I shall not want false witness to condemn me,
GLOUCESTER:
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt,
GLOUCESTER:
The ancient proverb will be well effected
GLOUCESTER:
'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'
CARDINAL:
My liege, his railing is intolerable
CARDINAL:
If those that care to keep your royal person
CARDINAL:
From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage
CARDINAL:
Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,
CARDINAL:
And the offender granted scope of speech,
CARDINAL:
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.
SUFFOLK:
Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
SUFFOLK:
With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,
SUFFOLK:
As if she had suborned some to swear
SUFFOLK:
False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
QUEEN MARGARET:
But I can give the loser leave to chide.
GLOUCESTER:
Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed,
GLOUCESTER:
Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!
GLOUCESTER:
And well such losers may have leave to speak.
BUCKINGHAM:
He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day
BUCKINGHAM:
Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.
CARDINAL:
Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.
GLOUCESTER:
Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
GLOUCESTER:
Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
GLOUCESTER:
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,
GLOUCESTER:
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
GLOUCESTER:
Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!
GLOUCESTER:
For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.
GLOUCESTER:
Exit, guarded
KING HENRY VI:
My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,
KING HENRY VI:
Do or undo, as if ourself were here.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What, will your highness leave the parliament?
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, Margaret, my heart is drown'd with grief,
KING HENRY VI:
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,
KING HENRY VI:
My body round engirt with misery,
KING HENRY VI:
For what's more miserable than discontent?
KING HENRY VI:
Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see
KING HENRY VI:
The map of honour, truth and loyalty
KING HENRY VI:
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
KING HENRY VI:
That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.
KING HENRY VI:
What louring star now envies thy estate,
KING HENRY VI:
That these great lords and Margaret our queen
KING HENRY VI:
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
KING HENRY VI:
Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong,
KING HENRY VI:
And as the butcher takes away the calf
KING HENRY VI:
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
KING HENRY VI:
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
KING HENRY VI:
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence,
KING HENRY VI:
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
KING HENRY VI:
Looking the way her harmless young one went,
KING HENRY VI:
And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
KING HENRY VI:
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
KING HENRY VI:
With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes
KING HENRY VI:
Look after him and cannot do him good,
KING HENRY VI:
So mighty are his vowed enemies.
KING HENRY VI:
His fortunes I will weep, and, 'twixt each groan
KING HENRY VI:
Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'
KING HENRY VI:
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, and YORK, SOMERSET remains apart
QUEEN MARGARET:
Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show
QUEEN MARGARET:
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
QUEEN MARGARET:
With sorrow snares relenting passengers,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,
QUEEN MARGARET:
With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child
QUEEN MARGARET:
That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--
QUEEN MARGARET:
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--
QUEEN MARGARET:
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To rid us of the fear we have of him.
CARDINAL:
That he should die is worthy policy,
CARDINAL:
But yet we want a colour for his death
CARDINAL:
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
SUFFOLK:
But, in my mind, that were no policy
SUFFOLK:
The king will labour still to save his life,
SUFFOLK:
The commons haply rise, to save his life,
SUFFOLK:
And yet we have but trivial argument,
SUFFOLK:
More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.
YORK:
So that, by this, you would not have him die.
SUFFOLK:
Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!
YORK:
'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
YORK:
But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,
YORK:
Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,
YORK:
Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set
YORK:
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,
YORK:
As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?
QUEEN MARGARET:
So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
SUFFOLK:
Madam, 'tis true, and were't not madness, then,
SUFFOLK:
To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
SUFFOLK:
Who being accused a crafty murderer,
SUFFOLK:
His guilt should be but idly posted over,
SUFFOLK:
Because his purpose is not executed.
SUFFOLK:
No, let him die, in that he is a fox,
SUFFOLK:
By nature proved an enemy to the flock,
SUFFOLK:
Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,
SUFFOLK:
As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.
SUFFOLK:
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him
SUFFOLK:
Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,
SUFFOLK:
Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,
SUFFOLK:
So he be dead, for that is good deceit
SUFFOLK:
Which mates him first that first intends deceit.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.
SUFFOLK:
Not resolute, except so much were done,
SUFFOLK:
For things are often spoke and seldom meant
SUFFOLK:
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,
SUFFOLK:
Seeing the deed is meritorious,
SUFFOLK:
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,
SUFFOLK:
Say but the word, and I will be his priest.
CARDINAL:
But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,
CARDINAL:
Ere you can take due orders for a priest
CARDINAL:
Say you consent and censure well the deed,
CARDINAL:
And I'll provide his executioner,
CARDINAL:
I tender so the safety of my liege.
SUFFOLK:
Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And so say I.
YORK:
And I    and now we three have spoke it,
YORK:
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.
YORK:
Enter a Post
Post:
Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,
Post:
To signify that rebels there are up
Post:
And put the Englishmen unto the sword
Post:
Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,
Post:
Before the wound do grow uncurable,
Post:
For, being green, there is great hope of help.
CARDINAL:
A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
CARDINAL:
What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
YORK:
That Somerset be sent as regent thither
YORK:
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
YORK:
Witness the fortune he hath had in France.
SOMERSET:
If York, with all his far-fet policy,
SOMERSET:
Had been the regent there instead of me,
SOMERSET:
He never would have stay'd in France so long.
YORK:
No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done
YORK:
I rather would have lost my life betimes
YORK:
Than bring a burthen of dishonour home
YORK:
By staying there so long till all were lost.
YORK:
Show me one scar character'd on thy skin
YORK:
Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,
QUEEN MARGARET:
If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
QUEEN MARGARET:
No more, good York, sweet Somerset, be still
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Might happily have proved far worse than his.
YORK:
What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!
SOMERSET:
And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!
CARDINAL:
My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.
CARDINAL:
The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
CARDINAL:
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen
CARDINAL:
To Ireland will you lead a band of men,
CARDINAL:
Collected choicely, from each county some,
CARDINAL:
And try your hap against the Irishmen?
YORK:
I will, my lord, so please his majesty.
SUFFOLK:
Why, our authority is his consent,
SUFFOLK:
And what we do establish he confirms
SUFFOLK:
Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.
YORK:
I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,
YORK:
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.
SUFFOLK:
A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.
SUFFOLK:
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
CARDINAL:
No more of him, for I will deal with him
CARDINAL:
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
CARDINAL:
And so break off, the day is almost spent
CARDINAL:
Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.
YORK:
My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days
YORK:
At Bristol I expect my soldiers,
YORK:
For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.
SUFFOLK:
I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.
SUFFOLK:
Exeunt all but YORK
YORK:
Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,
YORK:
And change misdoubt to resolution
YORK:
Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art
YORK:
Resign to death, it is not worth the enjoying
YORK:
Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,
YORK:
And find no harbour in a royal heart.
YORK:
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
YORK:
on thought,
YORK:
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
YORK:
My brain more busy than the labouring spider
YORK:
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
YORK:
Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,
YORK:
To send me packing with an host of men
YORK:
I fear me you but warm the starved snake,
YORK:
Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting
YORK:
your hearts.
YORK:
'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me
YORK:
I take it kindly, and yet be well assured
YORK:
You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
YORK:
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
YORK:
I will stir up in England some black storm
YORK:
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell,
YORK:
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
YORK:
Until the golden circuit on my head,
YORK:
Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,
YORK:
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
YORK:
And, for a minister of my intent,
YORK:
I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,
YORK:
John Cade of Ashford,
YORK:
To make commotion, as full well he can,
YORK:
Under the title of John Mortimer.
YORK:
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
YORK:
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
YORK:
And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
YORK:
Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine,
YORK:
And, in the end being rescued, I have seen
YORK:
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
YORK:
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
YORK:
Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
YORK:
Hath he conversed with the enemy,
YORK:
And undiscover'd come to me again
YORK:
And given me notice of their villanies.
YORK:
This devil here shall be my substitute,
YORK:
For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
YORK:
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble
YORK:
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
YORK:
How they affect the house and claim of York.
YORK:
Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,
YORK:
I know no pain they can inflict upon him
YORK:
Will make him say I moved him to those arms.
YORK:
Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,
YORK:
Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength
YORK:
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd,
YORK:
For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
YORK:
And Henry put apart, the next for me.
YORK:
Exit
YORK:
SCENE II. Bury St. Edmund's. A room of state.
YORK:
Enter certain Murderers, hastily
First Murderer:
Run to my Lord of Suffolk, let him know
First Murderer:
We have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.
Second Murderer:
O that it were to do! What have we done?
Second Murderer:
Didst ever hear a man so penitent?
Second Murderer:
Enter SUFFOLK
First Murder:
Here comes my lord.
SUFFOLK:
Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?
First Murderer:
Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
SUFFOLK:
Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house,
SUFFOLK:
I will reward you for this venturous deed.
SUFFOLK:
The king and all the peers are here at hand.
SUFFOLK:
Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,
SUFFOLK:
According as I gave directions?
First Murderer:
'Tis, my good lord.
SUFFOLK:
Away! be gone.
SUFFOLK:
Exeunt Murderers
SUFFOLK:
Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SOMERSET, with Attendants
KING HENRY VI:
Go, call our uncle to our presence straight,
KING HENRY VI:
Say we intend to try his grace to-day.
KING HENRY VI:
If he be guilty, as 'tis published.
SUFFOLK:
I'll call him presently, my noble lord.
SUFFOLK:
Exit
KING HENRY VI:
Lords, take your places, and, I pray you all,
KING HENRY VI:
Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester
KING HENRY VI:
Than from true evidence of good esteem
KING HENRY VI:
He be approved in practise culpable.
QUEEN MARGARET:
God forbid any malice should prevail,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That faultless may condemn a nobleman!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!
KING HENRY VI:
I thank thee, Meg, these words content me much.
KING HENRY VI:
Re-enter SUFFOLK
KING HENRY VI:
How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?
KING HENRY VI:
Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?
SUFFOLK:
Dead in his bed, my lord, Gloucester is dead.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Marry, God forfend!
CARDINAL:
God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night
CARDINAL:
The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.
CARDINAL:
KING HENRY VI swoons
QUEEN MARGARET:
How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.
SOMERSET:
Rear up his body, wring him by the nose.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!
SUFFOLK:
He doth revive again: madam, be patient.
KING HENRY VI:
O heavenly God!
QUEEN MARGARET:
How fares my gracious lord?
SUFFOLK:
Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!
KING HENRY VI:
What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?
KING HENRY VI:
Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
KING HENRY VI:
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers,
KING HENRY VI:
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
KING HENRY VI:
By crying comfort from a hollow breast,
KING HENRY VI:
Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
KING HENRY VI:
Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words,
KING HENRY VI:
Lay not thy hands on me, forbear, I say,
KING HENRY VI:
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
KING HENRY VI:
Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!
KING HENRY VI:
Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny
KING HENRY VI:
Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.
KING HENRY VI:
Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding
KING HENRY VI:
Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,
KING HENRY VI:
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight,
KING HENRY VI:
For in the shade of death I shall find joy,
KING HENRY VI:
In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Although the duke was enemy to him,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet he most Christian-like laments his death
QUEEN MARGARET:
And for myself, foe as he was to me,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And all to have the noble duke alive.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What know I how the world may deem of me?
QUEEN MARGARET:
For it is known we were but hollow friends
QUEEN MARGARET:
It may be judged I made the duke away,
QUEEN MARGARET:
So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
QUEEN MARGARET:
This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!
QUEEN MARGARET:
To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!
KING HENRY VI:
Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?
QUEEN MARGARET:
I am no loathsome leper, look on me.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Erect his statue and worship it,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And make my image but an alehouse sign.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
QUEEN MARGARET:
And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
QUEEN MARGARET:
Drove back again unto my native clime?
QUEEN MARGARET:
What boded this, but well forewarning wind
QUEEN MARGARET:
Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
QUEEN MARGARET:
What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts
QUEEN MARGARET:
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves
QUEEN MARGARET:
And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,
QUEEN MARGARET:
But left that hateful office unto thee
QUEEN MARGARET:
The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,
QUEEN MARGARET:
With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness
QUEEN MARGARET:
The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
QUEEN MARGARET:
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
QUEEN MARGARET:
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
QUEEN MARGARET:
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And when the dusky sky began to rob
QUEEN MARGARET:
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I took a costly jewel from my neck,
QUEEN MARGARET:
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And so I wish'd thy body might my heart
QUEEN MARGARET:
And even with this I lost fair England's view
QUEEN MARGARET:
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
QUEEN MARGARET:
And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
QUEEN MARGARET:
How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
QUEEN MARGARET:
The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
QUEEN MARGARET:
When he to madding Dido would unfold
QUEEN MARGARET:
His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!
QUEEN MARGARET:
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons
WARWICK:
It is reported, mighty sovereign,
WARWICK:
That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd
WARWICK:
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.
WARWICK:
The commons, like an angry hive of bees
WARWICK:
That want their leader, scatter up and down
WARWICK:
And care not who they sting in his revenge.
WARWICK:
Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,
WARWICK:
Until they hear the order of his death.
KING HENRY VI:
That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true,
KING HENRY VI:
But how he died God knows, not Henry
KING HENRY VI:
Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,
KING HENRY VI:
And comment then upon his sudden death.
WARWICK:
That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,
WARWICK:
With the rude multitude till I return.
WARWICK:
Exit
KING HENRY VI:
O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,
KING HENRY VI:
My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul
KING HENRY VI:
Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
KING HENRY VI:
If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,
KING HENRY VI:
For judgment only doth belong to thee.
KING HENRY VI:
Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
KING HENRY VI:
With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain
KING HENRY VI:
Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
KING HENRY VI:
To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,
KING HENRY VI:
And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling
KING HENRY VI:
But all in vain are these mean obsequies,
KING HENRY VI:
And to survey his dead and earthly image,
KING HENRY VI:
What were it but to make my sorrow greater?
KING HENRY VI:
Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed
WARWICK:
Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.
KING HENRY VI:
That is to see how deep my grave is made,
KING HENRY VI:
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,
KING HENRY VI:
For seeing him I see my life in death.
WARWICK:
As surely as my soul intends to live
WARWICK:
With that dread King that took our state upon him
WARWICK:
To free us from his father's wrathful curse,
WARWICK:
I do believe that violent hands were laid
WARWICK:
Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.
SUFFOLK:
A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
SUFFOLK:
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
WARWICK:
See how the blood is settled in his face.
WARWICK:
Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,
WARWICK:
Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,
WARWICK:
Being all descended to the labouring heart,
WARWICK:
Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,
WARWICK:
Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy,
WARWICK:
Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
WARWICK:
To blush and beautify the cheek again.
WARWICK:
But see, his face is black and full of blood,
WARWICK:
His eye-balls further out than when he lived,
WARWICK:
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man,
WARWICK:
His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling,
WARWICK:
His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd
WARWICK:
And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued
WARWICK:
Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking,
WARWICK:
His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,
WARWICK:
Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.
WARWICK:
It cannot be but he was murder'd here,
WARWICK:
The least of all these signs were probable.
SUFFOLK:
Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?
SUFFOLK:
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection,
SUFFOLK:
And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.
WARWICK:
But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,
WARWICK:
And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep
WARWICK:
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend,
WARWICK:
And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen
QUEEN MARGARET:
As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
WARWICK:
Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
WARWICK:
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,
WARWICK:
But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?
WARWICK:
Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,
WARWICK:
But may imagine how the bird was dead,
WARWICK:
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?
WARWICK:
Even so suspicious is this tragedy.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?
SUFFOLK:
I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men,
SUFFOLK:
But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
SUFFOLK:
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
SUFFOLK:
That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
SUFFOLK:
Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,
SUFFOLK:
That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.
SUFFOLK:
Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others
WARWICK:
What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?
QUEEN MARGARET:
He dares not calm his contumelious spirit
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.
WARWICK:
Madam, be still, with reverence may I say,
WARWICK:
For every word you speak in his behalf
WARWICK:
Is slander to your royal dignity.
SUFFOLK:
Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!
SUFFOLK:
If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,
SUFFOLK:
Thy mother took into her blameful bed
SUFFOLK:
Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock
SUFFOLK:
Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art,
SUFFOLK:
And never of the Nevils' noble race.
WARWICK:
But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
WARWICK:
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,
WARWICK:
Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,
WARWICK:
And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,
WARWICK:
I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee
WARWICK:
Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,
WARWICK:
And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
WARWICK:
That thou thyself was born in bastardy,
WARWICK:
And after all this fearful homage done,
WARWICK:
Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,
WARWICK:
Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
SUFFOLK:
Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,
SUFFOLK:
If from this presence thou darest go with me.
WARWICK:
Away even now, or I will drag thee hence
WARWICK:
Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee
WARWICK:
And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.
WARWICK:
Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK
KING HENRY VI:
What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!
KING HENRY VI:
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,
KING HENRY VI:
And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel
KING HENRY VI:
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.
KING HENRY VI:
A noise within
QUEEN MARGARET:
What noise is this?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK, with their weapons drawn
KING HENRY VI:
Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn
KING HENRY VI:
Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?
KING HENRY VI:
Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?
SUFFOLK:
The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury
SUFFOLK:
Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.
SALISBURY:
[To the Commons, entering]  Sirs, stand apart,
SALISBURY:
the king shall know your mind.
SALISBURY:
Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,
SALISBURY:
Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,
SALISBURY:
Or banished fair England's territories,
SALISBURY:
They will by violence tear him from your palace
SALISBURY:
And torture him with grievous lingering death.
SALISBURY:
They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died,
SALISBURY:
They say, in him they fear your highness' death,
SALISBURY:
And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
SALISBURY:
Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
SALISBURY:
As being thought to contradict your liking,
SALISBURY:
Makes them thus forward in his banishment.
SALISBURY:
They say, in care of your most royal person,
SALISBURY:
That if your highness should intend to sleep
SALISBURY:
And charge that no man should disturb your rest
SALISBURY:
In pain of your dislike or pain of death,
SALISBURY:
Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,
SALISBURY:
Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,
SALISBURY:
That slily glided towards your majesty,
SALISBURY:
It were but necessary you were waked,
SALISBURY:
Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,
SALISBURY:
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal,
SALISBURY:
And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
SALISBURY:
That they will guard you, whether you will or no,
SALISBURY:
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,
SALISBURY:
With whose envenomed and fatal sting,
SALISBURY:
Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,
SALISBURY:
They say, is shamefully bereft of life.
Commons:
[Within]  An answer from the king, my
Commons:
Lord of Salisbury!
SUFFOLK:
'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,
SUFFOLK:
Could send such message to their sovereign
SUFFOLK:
But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,
SUFFOLK:
To show how quaint an orator you are
SUFFOLK:
But all the honour Salisbury hath won
SUFFOLK:
Is, that he was the lord ambassador
SUFFOLK:
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.
Commons:
[Within]  An answer from the king, or we will all break in!
KING HENRY VI:
Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.
KING HENRY VI:
I thank them for their tender loving care,
KING HENRY VI:
And had I not been cited so by them,
KING HENRY VI:
Yet did I purpose as they do entreat,
KING HENRY VI:
For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy
KING HENRY VI:
Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means
KING HENRY VI:
And therefore, by His majesty I swear,
KING HENRY VI:
Whose far unworthy deputy I am,
KING HENRY VI:
He shall not breathe infection in this air
KING HENRY VI:
But three days longer, on the pain of death.
KING HENRY VI:
Exit SALISBURY
QUEEN MARGARET:
O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!
KING HENRY VI:
Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
KING HENRY VI:
No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,
KING HENRY VI:
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
KING HENRY VI:
Had I but said, I would have kept my word,
KING HENRY VI:
But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
KING HENRY VI:
If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found
KING HENRY VI:
On any ground that I am ruler of,
KING HENRY VI:
The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
KING HENRY VI:
Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me,
KING HENRY VI:
I have great matters to impart to thee.
KING HENRY VI:
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK
QUEEN MARGARET:
Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Heart's discontent and sour affliction
QUEEN MARGARET:
Be playfellows to keep you company!
QUEEN MARGARET:
There's two of you, the devil make a third!
QUEEN MARGARET:
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
SUFFOLK:
Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,
SUFFOLK:
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?
SUFFOLK:
A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?
SUFFOLK:
Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,
SUFFOLK:
I would invent as bitter-searching terms,
SUFFOLK:
As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,
SUFFOLK:
Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,
SUFFOLK:
With full as many signs of deadly hate,
SUFFOLK:
As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave
SUFFOLK:
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words,
SUFFOLK:
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint,
SUFFOLK:
Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract,
SUFFOLK:
Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban
SUFFOLK:
And even now my burthen'd heart would break,
SUFFOLK:
Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
SUFFOLK:
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
SUFFOLK:
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
SUFFOLK:
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
SUFFOLK:
Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!
SUFFOLK:
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,
SUFFOLK:
And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
SUFFOLK:
All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--
QUEEN MARGARET:
Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment'st thyself,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And turn the force of them upon thyself.
SUFFOLK:
You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
SUFFOLK:
Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
SUFFOLK:
Well could I curse away a winter's night,
SUFFOLK:
Though standing naked on a mountain top,
SUFFOLK:
Where biting cold would never let grass grow,
SUFFOLK:
And think it but a minute spent in sport.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That I may dew it with my mournful tears,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To wash away my woful monuments.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!
QUEEN MARGARET:
So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief,
QUEEN MARGARET:
'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,
QUEEN MARGARET:
As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
QUEEN MARGARET:
I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Adventure to be banished myself
QUEEN MARGARET:
And banished I am, if but from thee.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, speak not to me, even now be gone.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd
QUEEN MARGARET:
Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Loather a hundred times to part than die.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet now farewell, and farewell life with thee!
SUFFOLK:
Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,
SUFFOLK:
Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.
SUFFOLK:
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence,
SUFFOLK:
A wilderness is populous enough,
SUFFOLK:
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company
SUFFOLK:
For where thou art, there is the world itself,
SUFFOLK:
With every several pleasure in the world,
SUFFOLK:
And where thou art not, desolation.
SUFFOLK:
I can no more: live thou to joy thy life,
SUFFOLK:
Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.
SUFFOLK:
Enter VAUX
QUEEN MARGARET:
Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?
VAUX:
To signify unto his majesty
VAUX:
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death,
VAUX:
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,
VAUX:
That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,
VAUX:
Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.
VAUX:
Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
VAUX:
Were by his side, sometime he calls the king,
VAUX:
And whispers to his pillow, as to him,
VAUX:
The secrets of his overcharged soul,
VAUX:
And I am sent to tell his majesty
VAUX:
That even now he cries aloud for him.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Go tell this heavy message to the king.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Exit VAUX
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!
QUEEN MARGARET:
But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And with the southern clouds contend in tears,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming,
QUEEN MARGARET:
If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.
SUFFOLK:
If I depart from thee, I cannot live,
SUFFOLK:
And in thy sight to die, what were it else
SUFFOLK:
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
SUFFOLK:
Here could I breathe my soul into the air,
SUFFOLK:
As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe
SUFFOLK:
Dying with mother's dug between its lips
SUFFOLK:
Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,
SUFFOLK:
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
SUFFOLK:
To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth,
SUFFOLK:
So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
SUFFOLK:
Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
SUFFOLK:
And then it lived in sweet Elysium.
SUFFOLK:
To die by thee were but to die in jest,
SUFFOLK:
From thee to die were torture more than death
SUFFOLK:
O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,
QUEEN MARGARET:
It is applied to a deathful wound.
QUEEN MARGARET:
To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee,
QUEEN MARGARET:
For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
SUFFOLK:
I go.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And take my heart with thee.
SUFFOLK:
A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask
SUFFOLK:
That ever did contain a thing of worth.
SUFFOLK:
Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we
SUFFOLK:
This way fall I to death.
QUEEN MARGARET:
This way for me.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Exeunt severally
QUEEN MARGARET:
SCENE III. A bedchamber.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Enter the KING, SALISBURY, WARWICK, to the CARDINAL in bed
KING HENRY VI:
How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, to
KING HENRY VI:
thy sovereign.
CARDINAL:
If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,
CARDINAL:
Enough to purchase such another island,
CARDINAL:
So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.
KING HENRY VI:
Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,
KING HENRY VI:
Where death's approach is seen so terrible!
WARWICK:
Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.
CARDINAL:
Bring me unto my trial when you will.
CARDINAL:
Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
CARDINAL:
Can I make men live, whether they will or no?
CARDINAL:
O, torture me no more! I will confess.
CARDINAL:
Alive again? then show me where he is
CARDINAL:
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
CARDINAL:
He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
CARDINAL:
Comb down his hair, look, look! it stands upright,
CARDINAL:
Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
CARDINAL:
Give me some drink, and bid the apothecary
CARDINAL:
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.
KING HENRY VI:
O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.
KING HENRY VI:
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
KING HENRY VI:
O, beat away the busy meddling fiend
KING HENRY VI:
That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.
KING HENRY VI:
And from his bosom purge this black despair!
WARWICK:
See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!
SALISBURY:
Disturb him not, let him pass peaceably.
KING HENRY VI:
Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
KING HENRY VI:
Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,
KING HENRY VI:
Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
KING HENRY VI:
He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!
WARWICK:
So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
KING HENRY VI:
Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.
KING HENRY VI:
Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close,
KING HENRY VI:
And let us all to meditation.
KING HENRY VI:
Exeunt
KING HENRY VI:
ACT IV
KING HENRY VI:
SCENE I. The coast of Kent.
KING HENRY VI:
Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a  Captain, a Master, a Master's-mate, WALTER WHITMORE, and others, with them SUFFOLK, and others, prisoners
Captain:
The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day
Captain:
Is crept into the bosom of the sea,
Captain:
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
Captain:
That drag the tragic melancholy night,
Captain:
Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,
Captain:
Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
Captain:
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
Captain:
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize,
Captain:
For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,
Captain:
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,
Captain:
Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.
Captain:
Master, this prisoner freely give I thee,
Captain:
And thou that art his mate, make boot of this,
Captain:
The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.
First Gentleman:
What is my ransom, master? let me know.
Master:
A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
Master:
Master's-Mate	And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
Captain:
What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,
Captain:
And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
Captain:
Cut both the villains' throats, for die you shall
Captain:
The lives of those which we have lost in fight
Captain:
Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!
First Gentleman:
I'll give it, sir, and therefore spare my life.
Second Gentleman:
And so will I and write home for it straight.
WHITMORE:
I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
WHITMORE:
And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die,
WHITMORE:
To SUFFOLK
WHITMORE:
And so should these, if I might have my will.
Captain:
Be not so rash, take ransom, let him live.
SUFFOLK:
Look on my George, I am a gentleman
SUFFOLK:
Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
WHITMORE:
And so am I, my name is Walter Whitmore.
WHITMORE:
How now! why start'st thou? what, doth
WHITMORE:
death affright?
SUFFOLK:
Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
SUFFOLK:
A cunning man did calculate my birth
SUFFOLK:
And told me that by water I should die
SUFFOLK:
Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded,
SUFFOLK:
Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.
WHITMORE:
Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not
WHITMORE:
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,
WHITMORE:
But with our sword we wiped away the blot,
WHITMORE:
Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
WHITMORE:
Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,
WHITMORE:
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!
SUFFOLK:
Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,
SUFFOLK:
The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
WHITMORE:
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
SUFFOLK:
Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke
SUFFOLK:
Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?
Captain:
But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
SUFFOLK:
Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,
SUFFOLK:
The honourable blood of Lancaster,
SUFFOLK:
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
SUFFOLK:
Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
SUFFOLK:
Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule
SUFFOLK:
And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
SUFFOLK:
How often hast thou waited at my cup,
SUFFOLK:
Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.
SUFFOLK:
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
SUFFOLK:
Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,
SUFFOLK:
Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride,
SUFFOLK:
How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
SUFFOLK:
And duly waited for my coming forth?
SUFFOLK:
This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,
SUFFOLK:
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
WHITMORE:
Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
Captain:
First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
SUFFOLK:
Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.
Captain:
Convey him hence and on our longboat's side
Captain:
Strike off his head.
SUFFOLK:
Thou darest not, for thy own.
Captain:
Yes, Pole.
SUFFOLK:
Pole!
Captain:
Pool! Sir Pool! lord!
Captain:
Ay, kennel, puddle, sink, whose filth and dirt
Captain:
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
Captain:
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
Captain:
For swallowing the treasure of the realm
Captain:
Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground,
Captain:
And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,
Captain:
Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,
Captain:
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again
Captain:
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,
Captain:
For daring to affy a mighty lord
Captain:
Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
Captain:
Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.
Captain:
By devilish policy art thou grown great,
Captain:
And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged
Captain:
With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.
Captain:
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,
Captain:
The false revolting Normans thorough thee
Captain:
Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy
Captain:
Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,
Captain:
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
Captain:
The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,
Captain:
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,
Captain:
As hating thee, are rising up in arms
Captain:
And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
Captain:
By shameful murder of a guiltless king
Captain:
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,
Captain:
Burns with revenging fire, whose hopeful colours
Captain:
Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,
Captain:
Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'
Captain:
The commons here in Kent are up in arms
Captain:
And, to conclude, reproach and beggary
Captain:
Is crept into the palace of our king.
Captain:
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.
SUFFOLK:
O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
SUFFOLK:
Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!
SUFFOLK:
Small things make base men proud: this villain here,
SUFFOLK:
Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more
SUFFOLK:
Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
SUFFOLK:
Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives
SUFFOLK:
It is impossible that I should die
SUFFOLK:
By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
SUFFOLK:
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me
SUFFOLK:
I go of message from the queen to France,
SUFFOLK:
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.
Captain:
Walter,--
WHITMORE:
Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
SUFFOLK:
Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.
WHITMORE:
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
WHITMORE:
What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?
First Gentleman:
My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
SUFFOLK:
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,
SUFFOLK:
Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.
SUFFOLK:
Far be it we should honour such as these
SUFFOLK:
With humble suit: no, rather let my head
SUFFOLK:
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
SUFFOLK:
Save to the God of heaven and to my king,
SUFFOLK:
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
SUFFOLK:
Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.
SUFFOLK:
True nobility is exempt from fear
SUFFOLK:
More can I bear than you dare execute.
Captain:
Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
SUFFOLK:
Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
SUFFOLK:
That this my death may never be forgot!
SUFFOLK:
Great men oft die by vile bezonians
SUFFOLK:
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
SUFFOLK:
Murder'd sweet Tully, Brutus' bastard hand
SUFFOLK:
Stabb'd Julius Caesar, savage islanders
SUFFOLK:
Pompey the Great, and Suffolk dies by pirates.
SUFFOLK:
Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk
Captain:
And as for these whose ransom we have set,
Captain:
It is our pleasure one of them depart,
Captain:
Therefore come you with us and let him go.
Captain:
Exeunt all but the First Gentleman
Captain:
Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body
WHITMORE:
There let his head and lifeless body lie,
WHITMORE:
Until the queen his mistress bury it.
WHITMORE:
Exit
First Gentleman:
O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
First Gentleman:
His body will I bear unto the king
First Gentleman:
If he revenge it not, yet will his friends,
First Gentleman:
So will the queen, that living held him dear.
First Gentleman:
Exit with the body
First Gentleman:
SCENE II. Blackheath.
First Gentleman:
Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND
BEVIS:
Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath,
BEVIS:
they have been up these two days.
HOLLAND:
They have the more need to sleep now, then.
BEVIS:
I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress
BEVIS:
the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.
HOLLAND:
So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it
HOLLAND:
was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.
BEVIS:
O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.
HOLLAND:
The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
BEVIS:
Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.
HOLLAND:
True, and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation,
HOLLAND:
which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be
HOLLAND:
labouring men, and therefore should we be
HOLLAND:
magistrates.
BEVIS:
Thou hast hit it, for there's no better sign of a
BEVIS:
brave mind than a hard hand.
HOLLAND:
I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the
HOLLAND:
tanner of Wingham,--
BEVIS:
He shall have the skin of our enemies, to make
BEVIS:
dog's-leather of.
HOLLAND:
And Dick the Butcher,--
BEVIS:
Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's
BEVIS:
throat cut like a calf.
HOLLAND:
And Smith the weaver,--
BEVIS:
Argo, their thread of life is spun.
HOLLAND:
Come, come, let's fall in with them.
HOLLAND:
Drum. Enter CADE, DICK the Butcher, SMITH the Weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers
CADE:
We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--
DICK:
[Aside]  Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.
CADE:
For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with
CADE:
the spirit of putting down kings and princes,
CADE:
--Command silence.
DICK:
Silence!
CADE:
My father was a Mortimer,--
DICK:
[Aside]  He was an honest man, and a good
DICK:
bricklayer.
CADE:
My mother a Plantagenet,--
DICK:
[Aside]  I knew her well, she was a midwife.
CADE:
My wife descended of the Lacies,--
DICK:
[Aside]  She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and
DICK:
sold many laces.
SMITH:
[Aside]  But now of late, notable to travel with her
SMITH:
furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.
CADE:
Therefore am I of an honourable house.
DICK:
[Aside]  Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable,
DICK:
and there was he borne, under a hedge, for his
DICK:
father had never a house but the cage.
CADE:
Valiant I am.
SMITH:
[Aside]  A' must needs, for beggary is valiant.
CADE:
I am able to endure much.
DICK:
[Aside]  No question of that, for I have seen him
DICK:
whipped three market-days together.
CADE:
I fear neither sword nor fire.
SMITH:
[Aside]  He need not fear the sword, for his coat is of proof.
DICK:
[Aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear of
DICK:
fire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.
CADE:
Be brave, then, for your captain is brave, and vows
CADE:
reformation. There shall be in England seven
CADE:
halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped
CADE:
pot, shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony
CADE:
to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in
CADE:
common, and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to
CADE:
grass: and when I am king, as king I will be,--
ALL:
God save your majesty!
CADE:
I thank you, good people: there shall be no money,
CADE:
all shall eat and drink on my score, and I will
CADE:
apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree
CADE:
like brothers and worship me their lord.
DICK:
The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.
CADE:
Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable
CADE:
thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should
CADE:
be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled
CADE:
o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings
CADE:
but I say, 'tis the bee's wax, for I did but seal
CADE:
once to a thing, and I was never mine own man
CADE:
since. How now! who's there?
CADE:
Enter some, bringing forward the Clerk of Chatham
SMITH:
The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read and
SMITH:
cast accompt.
CADE:
O monstrous!
SMITH:
We took him setting of boys' copies.
CADE:
Here's a villain!
SMITH:
Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.
CADE:
Nay, then, he is a conjurer.
DICK:
Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.
CADE:
I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of mine
CADE:
honour, unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.
CADE:
Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee: what is thy name?
Clerk:
Emmanuel.
DICK:
They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill
DICK:
go hard with you.
CADE:
Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? or
CADE:
hast thou a mark to thyself, like an honest
CADE:
plain-dealing man?
CLERK:
Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up
CLERK:
that I can write my name.
ALL:
He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villain
ALL:
and a traitor.
CADE:
Away with him, I say! hang him with his pen and
CADE:
ink-horn about his neck.
CADE:
Exit one with the Clerk
CADE:
Enter MICHAEL
MICHAEL:
Where's our general?
CADE:
Here I am, thou particular fellow.
MICHAEL:
Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his
MICHAEL:
brother are hard by, with the king's forces.
CADE:
Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. He
CADE:
shall be encountered with a man as good as himself
CADE:
he is but a knight, is a'?
MICHAEL:
No.
CADE:
To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.
CADE:
Kneels
CADE:
Rise up Sir John Mortimer.
CADE:
Rises
CADE:
Now have at him!
CADE:
Enter SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD, with drum and soldiers
SIR HUMPHREY:
Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
SIR HUMPHREY:
Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down,
SIR HUMPHREY:
Home to your cottages, forsake this groom
SIR HUMPHREY:
The king is merciful, if you revolt.
WILLIAM STAFFORD:
But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,
WILLIAM STAFFORD:
If you go forward, therefore yield, or die.
CADE:
As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not
CADE:
It is to you, good people, that I speak,
CADE:
Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign,
CADE:
For I am rightful heir unto the crown.
SIR HUMPHREY:
Villain, thy father was a plasterer,
SIR HUMPHREY:
And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?
CADE:
And Adam was a gardener.
WILLIAM STAFFORD:
And what of that?
CADE:
Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.
CADE:
Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?
SIR HUMPHREY:
Ay, sir.
CADE:
By her he had two children at one birth.
WILLIAM STAFFORD:
That's false.
CADE:
Ay, there's the question, but I say, 'tis true
CADE:
The elder of them, being put to nurse,
CADE:
Was by a beggar-woman stolen away,
CADE:
And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,
CADE:
Became a bricklayer when he came to age
CADE:
His son am I, deny it, if you can.
DICK:
Nay, 'tis too true, therefore he shall be king.
SMITH:
Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and
SMITH:
the bricks are alive at this day to testify it,
SMITH:
therefore deny it not.
SIR HUMPHREY:
And will you credit this base drudge's words,
SIR HUMPHREY:
That speaks he knows not what?
ALL:
Ay, marry, will we, therefore get ye gone.
WILLIAM STAFFORD:
Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
CADE:
[Aside]  He lies, for I invented it myself.
CADE:
Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for his
CADE:
father's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys
CADE:
went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content
CADE:
he shall reign, but I'll be protector over him.
DICK:
And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head for
DICK:
selling the dukedom of Maine.
CADE:
And good reason, for thereby is England mained, and
CADE:
fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds
CADE:
it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say
CADE:
hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch
CADE:
and more than that, he can speak French, and
CADE:
therefore he is a traitor.
SIR HUMPHREY:
O gross and miserable ignorance!
CADE:
Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our
CADE:
enemies, go to, then, I ask but this: can he that
CADE:
speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good
CADE:
counsellor, or no?
ALL:
No, no, and therefore we'll have his head.
WILLIAM STAFFORD:
Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,
WILLIAM STAFFORD:
Assail them with the army of the king.
SIR HUMPHREY:
Herald, away, and throughout every town
SIR HUMPHREY:
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade,
SIR HUMPHREY:
That those which fly before the battle ends
SIR HUMPHREY:
May, even in their wives' and children's sight,
SIR HUMPHREY:
Be hang'd up for example at their doors
SIR HUMPHREY:
And you that be the king's friends, follow me.
SIR HUMPHREY:
Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY, and soldiers
CADE:
And you that love the commons, follow me.
CADE:
Now show yourselves men, 'tis for liberty.
CADE:
We will not leave one lord, one gentleman
CADE:
Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon,
CADE:
For they are thrifty honest men, and such
CADE:
As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.
DICK:
They are all in order and march toward us.
CADE:
But then are we in order when we are most
CADE:
out of order. Come, march forward.
CADE:
Exeunt
CADE:
SCENE III. Another part of Blackheath.
CADE:
Alarums to the fight, wherein SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD are slain. Enter CADE and the rest
CADE:
Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?
DICK:
Here, sir.
CADE:
They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou
CADE:
behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own
CADE:
slaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee,
CADE:
the Lent shall be as long again as it is, and thou
CADE:
shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking
CADE:
one.
DICK:
I desire no more.
CADE:
And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less. This
CADE:
monument of the victory will I bear,
CADE:
Putting on SIR HUMPHREY'S brigandine
CADE:
and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels
CADE:
till I do come to London, where we will have the
CADE:
mayor's sword borne before us.
DICK:
If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the
DICK:
gaols and let out the prisoners.
CADE:
Fear not that, I warrant thee. Come, let's march
CADE:
towards London.
CADE:
Exeunt
CADE:
SCENE IV. London. The palace.
CADE:
Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication, and the QUEEN with SUFFOLK'S head, BUCKINGHAM and Lord SAY
QUEEN MARGARET:
Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And makes it fearful and degenerate,
QUEEN MARGARET:
Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.
QUEEN MARGARET:
But who can cease to weep and look on this?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast
QUEEN MARGARET:
But where's the body that I should embrace?
BUCKINGHAM:
What answer makes your grace to the rebels'
BUCKINGHAM:
supplication?
KING HENRY VI:
I'll send some holy bishop to entreat,
KING HENRY VI:
For God forbid so many simple souls
KING HENRY VI:
Should perish by the sword! And I myself,
KING HENRY VI:
Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
KING HENRY VI:
Will parley with Jack Cade their general
KING HENRY VI:
But stay, I'll read it over once again.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,
QUEEN MARGARET:
And could it not enforce them to relent,
QUEEN MARGARET:
That were unworthy to behold the same?
KING HENRY VI:
Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.
SAY:
Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.
KING HENRY VI:
How now, madam!
KING HENRY VI:
Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?
KING HENRY VI:
I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,
KING HENRY VI:
Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.
QUEEN MARGARET:
No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Enter a Messenger
KING HENRY VI:
How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?
Messenger:
The rebels are in Southwark, fly, my lord!
Messenger:
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,
Messenger:
Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,
Messenger:
And calls your grace usurper openly
Messenger:
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
Messenger:
His army is a ragged multitude
Messenger:
Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless
Messenger:
Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's death
Messenger:
Hath given them heart and courage to proceed
Messenger:
All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,
Messenger:
They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.
KING HENRY VI:
O graceless men! they know not what they do.
BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious lord, return to Killingworth,
BUCKINGHAM:
Until a power be raised to put them down.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,
QUEEN MARGARET:
These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!
KING HENRY VI:
Lord Say, the traitors hate thee,
KING HENRY VI:
Therefore away with us to Killingworth.
SAY:
So might your grace's person be in danger.
SAY:
The sight of me is odious in their eyes,
SAY:
And therefore in this city will I stay
SAY:
And live alone as secret as I may.
SAY:
Enter another Messenger
Messenger:
Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge
Messenger:
The citizens fly and forsake their houses
Messenger:
The rascal people, thirsting after prey,
Messenger:
Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear
Messenger:
To spoil the city and your royal court.
BUCKINGHAM:
Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.
KING HENRY VI:
Come, Margaret, God, our hope, will succor us.
QUEEN MARGARET:
My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.
KING HENRY VI:
Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.
BUCKINGHAM:
Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.
SAY:
The trust I have is in mine innocence,
SAY:
And therefore am I bold and resolute.
SAY:
Exeunt
SAY:
SCENE V. London. The Tower.
SAY:
Enter SCALES upon the Tower, walking. Then enter two or three Citizens below
SCALES:
How now! is Jack Cade slain?
First Citizen:
No, my lord, nor likely to be slain, for they have
First Citizen:
won the bridge, killing all those that withstand
First Citizen:
them: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from
First Citizen:
the Tower, to defend the city from the rebels.
SCALES:
Such aid as I can spare you shall command,
SCALES:
But I am troubled here with them myself,
SCALES:
The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.
SCALES:
But get you to Smithfield, and gather head,
SCALES:
And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe,
SCALES:
Fight for your king, your country and your lives,
SCALES:
And so, farewell, for I must hence again.
SCALES:
Exeunt
SCALES:
SCENE VI. London. Cannon Street.
SCALES:
Enter CADE and the rest, and strikes his staff on London-stone
CADE:
Now is Mortimer lord of this city. And here, sitting
CADE:
upon London-stone, I charge and command that, of the
CADE:
city's cost, the pissing-conduit run nothing but
CADE:
claret wine this first year of our reign. And now
CADE:
henceforward it shall be treason for any that calls
CADE:
me other than Lord Mortimer.
CADE:
Enter a Soldier, running
Soldier:
Jack Cade! Jack Cade!
CADE:
Knock him down there.
CADE:
They kill him
SMITH:
If this fellow be wise, he'll never call ye Jack
SMITH:
Cade more: I think he hath a very fair warning.
DICK:
My lord, there's an army gathered together in
DICK:
Smithfield.
CADE:
Come, then, let's go fight with them, but first, go
CADE:
and set London bridge on fire, and, if you can, burn
CADE:
down the Tower too. Come, let's away.
CADE:
Exeunt
CADE:
SCENE VII. London. Smithfield.
CADE:
Alarums. MATTHEW GOFFE is slain, and all the rest. Then enter CADE, with his company.
CADE:
So, sirs: now go some and pull down the Savoy,
CADE:
others to the inns of court, down with them all.
DICK:
I have a suit unto your lordship.
CADE:
Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.
DICK:
Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.
HOLLAND:
[Aside]  Mass, 'twill be sore law, then, for he was
HOLLAND:
thrust in the mouth with a spear, and 'tis not whole
HOLLAND:
yet.
SMITH:
[Aside]  Nay, John, it will be stinking law for his
SMITH:
breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.
CADE:
I have thought upon it, it shall be so. Away, burn
CADE:
all the records of the realm: my mouth shall be
CADE:
the parliament of England.
HOLLAND:
[Aside]  Then we are like to have biting statutes,
HOLLAND:
unless his teeth be pulled out.
CADE:
And henceforward all things shall be in common.
CADE:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
My lord, a prize, a prize! here's the Lord Say,
Messenger:
which sold the towns in France, he that made us pay
Messenger:
one and twenty fifteens, and one shilling to the
Messenger:
pound, the last subsidy.
Messenger:
Enter BEVIS, with Lord SAY
CADE:
Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah,
CADE:
thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! now
CADE:
art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction
CADE:
regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for
CADE:
giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the
CADE:
dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these
CADE:
presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I
CADE:
am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such
CADE:
filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously
CADE:
corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
CADE:
grammar school, and whereas, before, our forefathers
CADE:
had no other books but the score and the tally, thou
CADE:
hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to
CADE:
the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a
CADE:
paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou
CADE:
hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
CADE:
a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian
CADE:
ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed
CADE:
justices of peace, to call poor men before them
CADE:
about matters they were not able to answer.
CADE:
Moreover, thou hast put them in prison, and because
CADE:
they could not read, thou hast hanged them, when,
CADE:
indeed, only for that cause they have been most
CADE:
worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?
SAY:
What of that?
CADE:
Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a
CADE:
cloak, when honester men than thou go in their hose
CADE:
and doublets.
DICK:
And work in their shirt too, as myself, for example,
DICK:
that am a butcher.
SAY:
You men of Kent,--
DICK:
What say you of Kent?
SAY:
Nothing but this, 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.'
CADE:
Away with him, away with him! he speaks Latin.
SAY:
Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.
SAY:
Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,
SAY:
Is term'd the civil'st place of this isle
SAY:
Sweet is the country, because full of riches,
SAY:
The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy,
SAY:
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.
SAY:
I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,
SAY:
Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.
SAY:
Justice with favour have I always done,
SAY:
Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.
SAY:
When have I aught exacted at your hands,
SAY:
But to maintain the king, the realm and you?
SAY:
Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,
SAY:
Because my book preferr'd me to the king,
SAY:
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,
SAY:
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,
SAY:
Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,
SAY:
You cannot but forbear to murder me
SAY:
This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings
SAY:
For your behoof,--
CADE:
Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?
SAY:
Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
SAY:
Those that I never saw and struck them dead.
BEVIS:
O monstrous coward! what, to come behind folks?
SAY:
These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.
CADE:
Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.
SAY:
Long sitting to determine poor men's causes
SAY:
Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.
CADE:
Ye shall have a hempen caudle, then, and the help of hatchet.
DICK:
Why dost thou quiver, man?
SAY:
The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.
CADE:
Nay, he nods at us, as who should say, I'll be even
CADE:
with you: I'll see if his head will stand steadier
CADE:
on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead him.
SAY:
Tell me wherein have I offended most?
SAY:
Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.
SAY:
Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?
SAY:
Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
SAY:
Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?
SAY:
These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,
SAY:
This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.
SAY:
O, let me live!
CADE:
[Aside]  I feel remorse in myself with his words,
CADE:
but I'll bridle it: he shall die, an it be but for
CADE:
pleading so well for his life. Away with him! he
CADE:
has a familiar under his tongue, he speaks not o'
CADE:
God's name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike
CADE:
off his head presently, and then break into his
CADE:
son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off
CADE:
his head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.
ALL:
It shall be done.
SAY:
Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,
SAY:
God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
SAY:
How would it fare with your departed souls?
SAY:
And therefore yet relent, and save my life.
CADE:
Away with him! and do as I command ye.
CADE:
Exeunt some with Lord SAY
CADE:
The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head
CADE:
on his shoulders, unless he pay me tribute, there
CADE:
shall not a maid be married, but she shall pay to me
CADE:
her maidenhead ere they have it: men shall hold of
CADE:
me in capite, and we charge and command that their
CADE:
wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell.
DICK:
My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside and take up
DICK:
commodities upon our bills?
CADE:
Marry, presently.
ALL:
O, brave!
ALL:
Re-enter one with the heads
CADE:
But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,
CADE:
for they loved well when they were alive. Now part
CADE:
them again, lest they consult about the giving up of
CADE:
some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the
CADE:
spoil of the city until night: for with these borne
CADE:
before us, instead of maces, will we ride through
CADE:
the streets, and at every corner have them kiss. Away!
CADE:
Exeunt
CADE:
SCENE VIII. Southwark.
CADE:
Alarum and retreat. Enter CADE and all his rabblement
CADE:
Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
CADE:
and knock down! throw them into Thames!
CADE:
Sound a parley
CADE:
What noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold to
CADE:
sound retreat or parley, when I command them kill?
CADE:
Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD, attended
BUCKINGHAM:
Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee
BUCKINGHAM:
Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the king
BUCKINGHAM:
Unto the commons whom thou hast misled,
BUCKINGHAM:
And here pronounce free pardon to them all
BUCKINGHAM:
That will forsake thee and go home in peace.
CLIFFORD:
What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent,
CLIFFORD:
And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you,
CLIFFORD:
Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?
CLIFFORD:
Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,
CLIFFORD:
Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!'
CLIFFORD:
Who hateth him and honours not his father,
CLIFFORD:
Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,
CLIFFORD:
Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.
ALL:
God save the king! God save the king!
CADE:
What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave? And
CADE:
you, base peasants, do ye believe him? will you
CADE:
needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?
CADE:
Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,
CADE:
that you should leave me at the White Hart in
CADE:
Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out
CADE:
these arms till you had recovered your ancient
CADE:
freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,
CADE:
and delight to live in slavery to the nobility. Let
CADE:
them break your backs with burthens, take your
CADE:
houses over your heads, ravish your wives and
CADE:
daughters before your faces: for me, I will make
CADE:
shift for one, and so, God's curse light upon you
CADE:
all!
ALL:
We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!
CLIFFORD:
Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,
CLIFFORD:
That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?
CLIFFORD:
Will he conduct you through the heart of France,
CLIFFORD:
And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?
CLIFFORD:
Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to,
CLIFFORD:
Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,
CLIFFORD:
Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
CLIFFORD:
Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,
CLIFFORD:
The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,
CLIFFORD:
Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?
CLIFFORD:
Methinks already in this civil broil
CLIFFORD:
I see them lording it in London streets,
CLIFFORD:
Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.
CLIFFORD:
Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry
CLIFFORD:
Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.
CLIFFORD:
To France, to France, and get what you have lost,
CLIFFORD:
Spare England, for it is your native coast,
CLIFFORD:
Henry hath money, you are strong and manly,
CLIFFORD:
God on our side, doubt not of victory.
ALL:
A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.
CADE:
Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this
CADE:
multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them
CADE:
to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me
CADE:
desolate. I see them lay their heads together to
CADE:
surprise me. My sword make way for me, for here is
CADE:
no staying. In despite of the devils and hell, have
CADE:
through the very middest of you? and heavens and
CADE:
honour be witness, that no want of resolution in me.
CADE:
but only my followers' base and ignominious
CADE:
treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.
CADE:
Exit
BUCKINGHAM:
What, is he fled? Go some, and follow him,
BUCKINGHAM:
And he that brings his head unto the king
BUCKINGHAM:
Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exeunt some of them
BUCKINGHAM:
Follow me, soldiers: we'll devise a mean
BUCKINGHAM:
To reconcile you all unto the king.
BUCKINGHAM:
Exeunt
BUCKINGHAM:
SCENE IX. Kenilworth Castle.
BUCKINGHAM:
Sound Trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SOMERSET, on the terrace
KING HENRY VI:
Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne,
KING HENRY VI:
And could command no more content than I?
KING HENRY VI:
No sooner was I crept out of my cradle
KING HENRY VI:
But I was made a king, at nine months old.
KING HENRY VI:
Was never subject long'd to be a king
KING HENRY VI:
As I do long and wish to be a subject.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD
BUCKINGHAM:
Health and glad tidings to your majesty!
KING HENRY VI:
Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surprised?
KING HENRY VI:
Or is he but retired to make him strong?
KING HENRY VI:
Enter below, multitudes, with halters about their necks
CLIFFORD:
He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield,
CLIFFORD:
And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,
CLIFFORD:
Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
KING HENRY VI:
Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,
KING HENRY VI:
To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!
KING HENRY VI:
Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives,
KING HENRY VI:
And show'd how well you love your prince and country
KING HENRY VI:
Continue still in this so good a mind,
KING HENRY VI:
And Henry, though he be infortunate,
KING HENRY VI:
Assure yourselves, will never be unkind
KING HENRY VI:
And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,
KING HENRY VI:
I do dismiss you to your several countries.
ALL:
God save the king! God save the king!
ALL:
Enter a Messenger
Messenger:
Please it your grace to be advertised
Messenger:
The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,
Messenger:
And with a puissant and a mighty power
Messenger:
Of gallowglasses and stout kerns
Messenger:
Is marching hitherward in proud array,
Messenger:
And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,
Messenger:
His arms are only to remove from thee
Messenger:
The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms traitor.
KING HENRY VI:
Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.
KING HENRY VI:
Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest,
KING HENRY VI:
Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate
KING HENRY VI:
But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed,
KING HENRY VI:
And now is York in arms to second him.
KING HENRY VI:
I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,
KING HENRY VI:
And ask him what's the reason of these arms.
KING HENRY VI:
Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower,
KING HENRY VI:
And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,
KING HENRY VI:
Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
SOMERSET:
My lord,
SOMERSET:
I'll yield myself to prison willingly,
SOMERSET:
Or unto death, to do my country good.
KING HENRY VI:
In any case, be not too rough in terms,
KING HENRY VI:
For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.
BUCKINGHAM:
I will, my lord, and doubt not so to deal
BUCKINGHAM:
As all things shall redound unto your good.
KING HENRY VI:
Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better,
KING HENRY VI:
For yet may England curse my wretched reign.
KING HENRY VI:
Flourish. Exeunt
KING HENRY VI:
SCENE X. Kent. IDEN's garden.
KING HENRY VI:
Enter CADE
CADE:
Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword,
CADE:
and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I
CADE:
hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for
CADE:
all the country is laid for me, but now am I so
CADE:
hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a
CADE:
thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,
CADE:
on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to
CADE:
see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another
CADE:
while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach
CADE:
this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
CADE:
was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a
CADE:
sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown
CADE:
bill, and many a time, when I have been dry and
CADE:
bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a
CADE:
quart pot to drink in, and now the word 'sallet'
CADE:
must serve me to feed on.
CADE:
Enter IDEN
IDEN:
Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,
IDEN:
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
IDEN:
This small inheritance my father left me
IDEN:
Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.
IDEN:
I seek not to wax great by others' waning,
IDEN:
Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy
IDEN:
Sufficeth that I have maintains my state
IDEN:
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.
CADE:
Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a
CADE:
stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.
CADE:
Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand
CADE:
crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but
CADE:
I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow
CADE:
my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.
IDEN:
Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,
IDEN:
I know thee not, why, then, should I betray thee?
IDEN:
Is't not enough to break into my garden,
IDEN:
And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,
IDEN:
Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,
IDEN:
But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?
CADE:
Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was
CADE:
broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I
CADE:
have eat no meat these five days, yet, come thou and
CADE:
thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead
CADE:
as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.
IDEN:
Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
IDEN:
That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,
IDEN:
Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.
IDEN:
Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,
IDEN:
See if thou canst outface me with thy looks
IDEN:
Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser,
IDEN:
Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,
IDEN:
Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon,
IDEN:
My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast,
IDEN:
And if mine arm be heaved in the air,
IDEN:
Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.
IDEN:
As for words, whose greatness answers words,
IDEN:
Let this my sword report what speech forbears.
CADE:
By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I
CADE:
heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out
CADE:
the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou
CADE:
sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou
CADE:
mayst be turned to hobnails.
CADE:
Here they fight. CADE falls
CADE:
O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me
CADE:
let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me
CADE:
but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them
CADE:
all. Wither, garden, and be henceforth a
CADE:
burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,
CADE:
because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.
IDEN:
Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
IDEN:
Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,
IDEN:
And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead
IDEN:
Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,
IDEN:
But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,
IDEN:
To emblaze the honour that thy master got.
CADE:
Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell
CADE:
Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort
CADE:
all the world to be cowards, for I, that never
CADE:
feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.
CADE:
Dies
IDEN:
How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
IDEN:
Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee,
IDEN:
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,
IDEN:
So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.
IDEN:
Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
IDEN:
Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,
IDEN:
And there cut off thy most ungracious head,
IDEN:
Which I will bear in triumph to the king,
IDEN:
Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.
IDEN:
Exit
IDEN:
ACT V
IDEN:
SCENE I. Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.
IDEN:
Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum and colours
YORK:
From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,
YORK:
And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head
YORK:
Ring, bells, aloud, burn, bonfires, clear and bright,
YORK:
To entertain great England's lawful king.
YORK:
Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?
YORK:
Let them obey that know not how to rule,
YORK:
This hand was made to handle naught but gold.
YORK:
I cannot give due action to my words,
YORK:
Except a sword or sceptre balance it
YORK:
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,
YORK:
On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.
YORK:
Enter BUCKINGHAM
YORK:
Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?
YORK:
The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.
BUCKINGHAM:
York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.
YORK:
Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
YORK:
Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?
BUCKINGHAM:
A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,
BUCKINGHAM:
To know the reason of these arms in peace,
BUCKINGHAM:
Or why thou, being a subject as I am,
BUCKINGHAM:
Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,
BUCKINGHAM:
Should raise so great a power without his leave,
BUCKINGHAM:
Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
YORK:
[Aside]  Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great
YORK:
O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
YORK:
I am so angry at these abject terms,
YORK:
And now, like Ajax Telamonius,
YORK:
On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
YORK:
I am far better born than is the king,
YORK:
More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts
YORK:
But I must make fair weather yet a while,
YORK:
Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--
YORK:
Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,
YORK:
That I have given no answer all this while,
YORK:
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
YORK:
The cause why I have brought this army hither
YORK:
Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,
YORK:
Seditious to his grace and to the state.
BUCKINGHAM:
That is too much presumption on thy part
BUCKINGHAM:
But if thy arms be to no other end,
BUCKINGHAM:
The king hath yielded unto thy demand
BUCKINGHAM:
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
YORK:
Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?
BUCKINGHAM:
Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.
YORK:
Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.
YORK:
Soldiers, I thank you all, disperse yourselves,
YORK:
Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,
YORK:
You shall have pay and every thing you wish.
YORK:
And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,
YORK:
Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
YORK:
As pledges of my fealty and love,
YORK:
I'll send them all as willing as I live
YORK:
Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,
YORK:
Is his to use, so Somerset may die.
BUCKINGHAM:
York, I commend this kind submission
BUCKINGHAM:
We twain will go into his highness' tent.
BUCKINGHAM:
Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants
KING HENRY VI:
Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,
KING HENRY VI:
That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?
YORK:
In all submission and humility
YORK:
York doth present himself unto your highness.
KING HENRY VI:
Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
YORK:
To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,
YORK:
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,
YORK:
Who since I heard to be discomfited.
YORK:
Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head
IDEN:
If one so rude and of so mean condition
IDEN:
May pass into the presence of a king,
IDEN:
Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,
IDEN:
The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.
KING HENRY VI:
The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!
KING HENRY VI:
O, let me view his visage, being dead,
KING HENRY VI:
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.
KING HENRY VI:
Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?
IDEN:
I was, an't like your majesty.
KING HENRY VI:
How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?
IDEN:
Alexander Iden, that's my name,
IDEN:
A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.
BUCKINGHAM:
So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
BUCKINGHAM:
He were created knight for his good service.
KING HENRY VI:
Iden, kneel down.
KING HENRY VI:
He kneels
KING HENRY VI:
Rise up a knight.
KING HENRY VI:
We give thee for reward a thousand marks,
KING HENRY VI:
And will that thou henceforth attend on us.
IDEN:
May Iden live to merit such a bounty.
IDEN:
And never live but true unto his liege!
IDEN:
Rises
IDEN:
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET
KING HENRY VI:
See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen
KING HENRY VI:
Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.
QUEEN MARGARET:
For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,
QUEEN MARGARET:
But boldly stand and front him to his face.
YORK:
How now! is Somerset at liberty?
YORK:
Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,
YORK:
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
YORK:
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
YORK:
False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,
YORK:
Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
YORK:
King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,
YORK:
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,
YORK:
Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.
YORK:
That head of thine doth not become a crown,
YORK:
Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,
YORK:
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
YORK:
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
YORK:
Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,
YORK:
Is able with the change to kill and cure.
YORK:
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
YORK:
And with the same to act controlling laws.
YORK:
Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more
YORK:
O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.
SOMERSET:
O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,
SOMERSET:
Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown,
SOMERSET:
Obey, audacious traitor, kneel for grace.
YORK:
Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,
YORK:
If they can brook I bow a knee to man.
YORK:
Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail,
YORK:
Exit Attendant
YORK:
I know, ere they will have me go to ward,
YORK:
They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To say if that the bastard boys of York
QUEEN MARGARET:
Shall be the surety for their traitor father.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Exit BUCKINGHAM
YORK:
O blood-besotted Neapolitan,
YORK:
Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!
YORK:
The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,
YORK:
Shall be their father's bail, and bane to those
YORK:
That for my surety will refuse the boys!
YORK:
Enter EDWARD and RICHARD
YORK:
See where they come: I'll warrant they'll
YORK:
make it good.
YORK:
Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD
QUEEN MARGARET:
And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
CLIFFORD:
Health and all happiness to my lord the king!
CLIFFORD:
Kneels
YORK:
I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?
YORK:
Nay, do not fright us with an angry look,
YORK:
We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again,
YORK:
For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.
CLIFFORD:
This is my king, York, I do not mistake,
CLIFFORD:
But thou mistakest me much to think I do
CLIFFORD:
To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, Clifford, a bedlam and ambitious humour
KING HENRY VI:
Makes him oppose himself against his king.
CLIFFORD:
He is a traitor, let him to the Tower,
CLIFFORD:
And chop away that factious pate of his.
QUEEN MARGARET:
He is arrested, but will not obey,
QUEEN MARGARET:
His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.
YORK:
Will you not, sons?
EDWARD:
Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.
RICHARD:
And if words will not, then our weapons shall.
CLIFFORD:
Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!
YORK:
Look in a glass, and call thy image so
YORK:
I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.
YORK:
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,
YORK:
That with the very shaking of their chains
YORK:
They may astonish these fell-lurking curs
YORK:
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.
YORK:
Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY
CLIFFORD:
Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.
CLIFFORD:
And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,
CLIFFORD:
If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.
RICHARD:
Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur
RICHARD:
Run back and bite, because he was withheld,
RICHARD:
Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,
RICHARD:
Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried
RICHARD:
And such a piece of service will you do,
RICHARD:
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.
CLIFFORD:
Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,
CLIFFORD:
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!
YORK:
Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
CLIFFORD:
Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
KING HENRY VI:
Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
KING HENRY VI:
Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,
KING HENRY VI:
Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!
KING HENRY VI:
What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,
KING HENRY VI:
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
KING HENRY VI:
O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
KING HENRY VI:
If it be banish'd from the frosty head,
KING HENRY VI:
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?
KING HENRY VI:
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,
KING HENRY VI:
And shame thine honourable age with blood?
KING HENRY VI:
Why art thou old, and want'st experience?
KING HENRY VI:
Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?
KING HENRY VI:
For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me
KING HENRY VI:
That bows unto the grave with mickle age.
SALISBURY:
My lord, I have consider'd with myself
SALISBURY:
The title of this most renowned duke,
SALISBURY:
And in my conscience do repute his grace
SALISBURY:
The rightful heir to England's royal seat.
KING HENRY VI:
Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
SALISBURY:
I have.
KING HENRY VI:
Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
SALISBURY:
It is great sin to swear unto a sin,
SALISBURY:
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.
SALISBURY:
Who can be bound by any solemn vow
SALISBURY:
To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,
SALISBURY:
To force a spotless virgin's chastity,
SALISBURY:
To reave the orphan of his patrimony,
SALISBURY:
To wring the widow from her custom'd right,
SALISBURY:
And have no other reason for this wrong
SALISBURY:
But that he was bound by a solemn oath?
QUEEN MARGARET:
A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
KING HENRY VI:
Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
YORK:
Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
YORK:
I am resolved for death or dignity.
CLIFFORD:
The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.
WARWICK:
You were best to go to bed and dream again,
WARWICK:
To keep thee from the tempest of the field.
CLIFFORD:
I am resolved to bear a greater storm
CLIFFORD:
Than any thou canst conjure up to-day,
CLIFFORD:
And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,
CLIFFORD:
Might I but know thee by thy household badge.
WARWICK:
Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
WARWICK:
The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,
WARWICK:
This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,
WARWICK:
As on a mountain top the cedar shows
WARWICK:
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
WARWICK:
Even to affright thee with the view thereof.
CLIFFORD:
And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
CLIFFORD:
And tread it under foot with all contempt,
CLIFFORD:
Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
And so to arms, victorious father,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
To quell the rebels and their complices.
RICHARD:
Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,
RICHARD:
For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
RICHARD:
If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.
RICHARD:
Exeunt severally
RICHARD:
SCENE II. Saint Alban's.
RICHARD:
Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK
WARWICK:
Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls
WARWICK:
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,
WARWICK:
Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum
WARWICK:
And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,
WARWICK:
Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me
WARWICK:
Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,
WARWICK:
Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.
WARWICK:
Enter YORK
WARWICK:
How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
YORK:
The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,
YORK:
But match to match I have encounter'd him
YORK:
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
YORK:
Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.
YORK:
Enter CLIFFORD
WARWICK:
Of one or both of us the time is come.
YORK:
Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
YORK:
For I myself must hunt this deer to death.
WARWICK:
Then, nobly, York, 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.
WARWICK:
As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,
WARWICK:
It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.
WARWICK:
Exit
CLIFFORD:
What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?
YORK:
With thy brave bearing should I be in love,
YORK:
But that thou art so fast mine enemy.
CLIFFORD:
Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
CLIFFORD:
But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.
YORK:
So let it help me now against thy sword
YORK:
As I in justice and true right express it.
CLIFFORD:
My soul and body on the action both!
YORK:
A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.
YORK:
They fight, and CLIFFORD falls
CLIFFORD:
La fin couronne les oeuvres.
CLIFFORD:
Dies
YORK:
Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.
YORK:
Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!
YORK:
Exit
YORK:
Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Shame and confusion! all is on the rout,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Whom angry heavens do make their minister
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
He that is truly dedicate to war
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Hath not essentially but by circumstance
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
The name of valour.
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Seeing his dead father
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
O, let the vile world end,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
And the premised flames of the last day
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Knit earth and heaven together!
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Particularities and petty sounds
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
The silver livery of advised age,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
It shall be stony. York not our old men spares,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
No more will I their babes: tears virginal
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Meet I an infant of the house of York,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Into as many gobbets will I cut it
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
As did AEneas old Anchises bear,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
But then AEneas bare a living load,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Exit, bearing off his father
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is killed
RICHARD:
So, lie thou there,
RICHARD:
For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,
RICHARD:
The Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset
RICHARD:
Hath made the wizard famous in his death.
RICHARD:
Sword, hold thy temper, heart, be wrathful still
RICHARD:
Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.
RICHARD:
Exit
RICHARD:
Fight: excursions. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and others
QUEEN MARGARET:
Away, my lord! you are slow, for shame, away!
KING HENRY VI:
Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly
QUEEN MARGARET:
Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
QUEEN MARGARET:
To give the enemy way, and to secure us
QUEEN MARGARET:
By what we can, which can no more but fly.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Alarum afar off
QUEEN MARGARET:
If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
QUEEN MARGARET:
Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,
QUEEN MARGARET:
As well we may, if not through your neglect,
QUEEN MARGARET:
We shall to London get, where you are loved
QUEEN MARGARET:
And where this breach now in our fortunes made
QUEEN MARGARET:
May readily be stopp'd.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
But that my heart's on future mischief set,
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
But fly you must, uncurable discomfit
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Away, for your relief! and we will live
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
To see their day and them our fortune give
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Away, my lord, away!
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Exeunt
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
SCENE III. Fields near St. Alban's.
YOUNG CLIFFORD:
Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and Soldiers, with drum and colours
YORK:
Of Salisbury, who can report of him,
YORK:
That winter lion, who in rage forgets
YORK:
Aged contusions and all brush of time,
YORK:
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
YORK:
Repairs him with occasion? This happy day
YORK:
Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,
YORK:
If Salisbury be lost.
RICHARD:
My noble father,
RICHARD:
Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,
RICHARD:
Three times bestrid him, thrice I led him off,
RICHARD:
Persuaded him from any further act
RICHARD:
But still, where danger was, still there I met him,
RICHARD:
And like rich hangings in a homely house,
RICHARD:
So was his will in his old feeble body.
RICHARD:
But, noble as he is, look where he comes.
RICHARD:
Enter SALISBURY
SALISBURY:
Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day,
SALISBURY:
By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard
SALISBURY:
God knows how long it is I have to live,
SALISBURY:
And it hath pleased him that three times to-day
SALISBURY:
You have defended me from imminent death.
SALISBURY:
Well, lords, we have not got that which we have
SALISBURY:
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
SALISBURY:
Being opposites of such repairing nature.
YORK:
I know our safety is to follow them,
YORK:
For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,
YORK:
To call a present court of parliament.
YORK:
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.
YORK:
What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?
WARWICK:
After them! nay, before them, if we can.
WARWICK:
Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day
WARWICK:
Saint Alban's battle won by famous York
WARWICK:
Shall be eternized in all age to come.
WARWICK:
Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all
WARWICK:
And more such days as these to us befall!
WARWICK:
Exeunt
